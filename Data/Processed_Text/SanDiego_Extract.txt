SCOPE

III.

BACKGROUND

This Department procedure establishes guidelines on the use of force options available to
Department personnel.

This procedure applies to all members of the Department.

The San Diego Police Department recognizes and respects the value of human life,
having this as its highest priority. It is the policy and practice of the Department to train
its personnel in the use of the safest, most humane restraint procedures and force
options currently known. The Department seeks to demonstrate integrity, and make
decisions that are fair, respectful, lawful, and based on good judgment.

 
 
 

 

 

In the performance of their duties, officers may encounter situations where the use of 
force is reasonable in order to effect a detention or arrest, to overcome resistance, or to 
protect themselves or others. Force, as authorized by Penal Code section 835a, and as 
set forth in this policy, may be used in those situations. The decision to use deadly force 
in response to an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer or 
another person is one of the most critical decisions an officer will ever be called upon to 
make. 
Only force that is reasonable to overcome resistance may be used to effect a detention or 
an arrest, or take a mentally ill or emotionally disturbed person into protective custody. 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court in Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), acknowledged that 
the “reasonableness” test in analyzing the use of force is “not capable of precise 
definition or mechanical application.”  For that reason, in determining whether an 
officer’s use of force is reasonable in a particular case, it is necessary to evaluate the 
facts and circumstances confronting the officer at the time that force was used. All of the 
surrounding circumstances will be considered, including whether the subject posed an 
imminent threat to the safety of the officer or others, the severity of the crime at issue, 
and whether the suspect actively resisted arrest or attempted to flee. 

Penal Code section 835a authorizes an officer to use reasonable force to make a lawful 
arrest, prevent an escape, or to overcome resistance. Officers are not required to retreat 
or desist from their efforts by reason of resistance or threatened resistance of the person 
being arrested. 
 
The evaluation of an officer’s use of force will be undertaken from the perspective of a 
reasonable officer on the scene, not through the 20/20 vision of hindsight. The central 
inquiry in every use of force case is whether the amount of force used by the officer was 
objectively reasonable in light of the particular circumstances faced by the officer. 
 

 
IV.  DEFINITIONS 
 

A. 

B. 

Active Resistance - behavior that consists of a refusal to comply with verbal 
commands and conveys a threat to the officer or another person, or consists 
of physical opposition to attempts of control by the officer. 

Assaultive Behavior - behavior that consists of aggressive physical opposition 
to being physically controlled and conveys a threat of injury to the officer; or, 
behavior that consists of a threat of attack conveyed through aggressive 
physical actions or aggressive physical actions coupled with verbal threats. 
Verbal threats alone do not constitute assaultive behavior.  Assaultive behavior 
can be directed at the officer or others.

G. 

H. 

I. 

J. 

K. 

Compliant Behavior - behavior that complies with the officer’s verbal 
commands. 

 

Crowd Control and Mobile Field Force Techniques - levels of force that include 
close range strikes with an impact weapon. These strikes are designed to 
redirect or move a subject who fails to follow verbal commands. The amount of 
force used in delivering the strike should be reasonable given the 
circumstances.  The intent of the technique is to move a subject backwards or to 
the side. 
 
Deadly Force - force that creates a substantial risk of causing death or 
serious bodily injury. 
 
Defending Force - the force needed to stop assaultive behavior against an officer 
or another person. This level of force generally involves impact strikes by the 
officer. Impact strikes can be delivered either by personal body weapons (e.g., 
hands, feet, knees, etc.) or impact weapons (e.g., PR-24, OPN, Baton, Flash 
light). Due to the potential for serious injury, intentional strikes with an impact 
weapon are prohibited from being directed at the head, face or throat of the 
subject unless the subject’s actions and behavior pose an imminent threat of 
death or serious bodily injury to the officer or others. 
 
Distraction Techniques - acts used to divert or redirect a subject’s focus away 
from resistive behavior in order to assist the officer in gaining control of the 
individual. Distraction techniques may include a controlled strike, using a lower 
level of force aimed at a specific area which is not intended and not likely to 
cause injury. Personal body weapons may be used under these constraints, when 
lesser controlling force has not been effective or the officer reasonably believes 
lesser controlling force will not be effective. If a distraction technique proves 
ineffective, a different distraction technique or force option should be 
considered. 
 
Force - the act of gaining and/or maintaining control of a subject or situation. 
 
Greater Controlling Force - the force needed to control a subject who engages 
in active resistance. This level of force may involve the use of techniques such 
as takedowns, distractions techniques, chemical agents, and the carotid 
restraint. 
 
Lesser Controlling Force - the force needed to control a subject who engages in 
passive resistance. This level of force generally involves use of physical 
strength, pain compliance defense techniques, and control holds. 
 
Life-threatening Behavior - behavior likely to cause serious bodily injury 
or death. 
 

DP 1.04 - Use of Force 1/23/20193 of 11Passive Resistance - behavior that consists of a refusal to comply with 
verbal commands and does not convey a threat to the officer or another 
person. 
 
Verbal Control - a tactic used when encountering compliant behavior.  Such 
control consists of the officer’s mere presence, requests, explanations and 
orders. 

 
 
V. 
 

PROCEDURES 

Force, as defined above, may be used to effect an investigative detention or arrest; 
control a subject who is in lawful custody; prevent an escape; or, protect the 
officer, the subject, or another person from injury or death. Any time force is 
used, the officer shall apply a level of force that is reasonable for the situation. 
 
Officers should use caution when using a takedown technique on a handcuffed 
prisoner. There is potential for injury since the prisoner’s hands are behind his or 
her back, and they have no way of breaking his or her fall. If possible, when the 
person is handcuffed, officers should consider other controlling methods prior to a 
takedown. 
 
The use of canines, extended range impact weapons, and standard impact weapon 
techniques may be used to control an actively resisting subject reasonably 
believed to possess, or have immediate access to, a deadly weapon. 
 
Officers should maintain control of enforcement situations. Officers who are not 
readily identifiable as police officers, whether on- or off-duty, shall identify 
themselves as police officers, unless identification would jeopardize the safety of 
the officer or others. Subjects should not be allowed to gain the advantage in a 
physical confrontation. Officers may need to use a force option which is greater 
than the subject's force level and which is reasonable under the circumstances. 

The use of force by an officer can be viewed as a matrix of force options that can 
be used in response to a subject's actions and behavior. The matrix is designed to 
assist officers in understanding how force can escalate and assist officers in 
documenting the subsequent force used. The force matrix illustrates the 
relationship between a subject’s actions and the officer’s response. As force 
options move from lesser to greater levels, the risk of injury to the subject and/or 
officer increases. However, there may be situations and circumstances that do not 
conform to this matrix.  Officers who experience those unusual situations must 
use only that amount of force that is reasonable, based upon the subject's actions 
and behavior.

DP 1.04 - Use of Force 1/23/20194 of 11F. 

The Force Matrix is broken down into the following five levels: 

First level - officers attempt to gain compliance by talking or otherwise 
communicating with the subject, explaining what the subject is to do and 
giving the subject the opportunity to comply with the officer's demands. 

Second level - officers use control tactics, such as escorting or 
compression and pain compliance techniques, on subjects displaying 
passive resistant behavior. Controlling force is used when the subject 
passively fails to respond to verbal direction. 

Third level - officers seek to control a subject’s active resistance by using 
lesser force options, in addition to neck restraint, chemical agents, 
distraction techniques, and Taser. 

Fourth level - officers defend themselves or others against a subject's 
assault, or threat of assault, with the use of defending force or lesser force 
options. Defending force includes strikes with hard impact and personal 
body weapons. 
 
Fifth level - officers defend themselves or others against the subject’s life- 
threatening behavior with the use of deadly force. 

G. 

Various factors, which pertain to officers and/or subjects, will effect an 
officer's force options and tactics. These factors include, but are not limited to, 
the following: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Age; 

Availability of other options; 
 
Confined spaces; 
 
Ground fighting; 
 
Distance between subject(s) and officer(s); 
 
Influence of alcohol or drugs;

Use of Firearms 

1. 

Officers shall not discharge any firearm in the performance of their duties, 
except as authorized by this Department procedure. 

 

2. 

No officer shall discharge a firearm in the performance of duty except: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

During authorized training at a target range; 
 
When the officer has a reasonable belief that a subject (or 
animal) poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily 
injury to the officer or another person; 
 
When necessary to apprehend a fleeing suspect if there is 
probable cause to believe the suspect has committed a felony 
involving the infliction or threatened infliction of death or 
serious bodily injury, and the officer reasonably believes the 
suspect is armed with a deadly weapon and the suspect’s escape 
would pose an imminent threat to the officer or others; or, 
 
As permitted by Department Procedure 6.09, Handling of 
Injured Animals. 

A verbal warning to submit to the authority of the officer shall be given 
prior to the use of a firearm, if feasible, and if doing so would not 
increase the danger to the officer or other persons. 

Officers shall exercise the utmost care in their handling and use of 
firearms while engaged in the performance of their duties and while 
exercising their option to carry a loaded and concealed weapon while 
off- duty. Factors that should be considered before an officer discharges 
a firearm include, but are not limited to, the following: 

a. 

Immediacy of the threat; 

3. 

4.

Environment (field of fire); 
 
Capabilities of the suspect’s weapon; 
 
Officer’s present capability with the weapon; and, 

Type of crime. 

5. 

Firearms are found to be generally ineffective in stopping vehicles. Firearms 
shall  not  be  discharged  at  a  vehicle  solely  in  an  attempt to  disable  the 
vehicle. Officers shall consider the ramifications when shooting at moving 
vehicles, such as: 

Moving vehicles present a rapidly changing field of fire; 

If the driver is incapacitated, the vehicle would be uncontrolled; 
or, 
 
The action could create a danger to the public that outweighs 
the need to use deadly force. 

6. 

Officers shall not discharge a firearm at an occupant of a vehicle unless: 

The officer has probable cause to believe that the subject or the 
vehicle poses an immediate threat of death or serious 
physical harm to the officer and there is no reasonable 
alternative for the officer to avoid the harm; or, 
 
The officer has probable cause to believe that the subject or the 
vehicle poses an immediate threat of death or serious 
physical harm to other persons. 

7. 

8. 

Officers shall not knowingly position themselves in the path of a 
moving vehicle. 

Warning shots present a danger to the officer and other persons. They 
are prohibited, except under exigent circumstances when: 

The officer has a reasonable belief that a subject (or animal) poses 
an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the officer 
or another person. 
 
 
 
 

DP 1.04 - Use of Force 1/23/20197 of 11b. 

The warning shot is necessary to apprehend a fleeing suspect if 
there is probable cause to believe the suspect has committed a 
felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of death or 
serious bodily injury, and the officer reasonably believes the 
suspect is armed with a deadly weapon and the suspect’s escape 
would pose an imminent threat to the officer or others. 

9. 

Firearms are not designed or intended for use as impact weapons and shall 
not be used to strike another person, except when necessary to protect the 
officer or another person from death or serious bodily injury. 

 
 
VI.  REPORTING THE USE OF FORCE 
 

A. 

Officers who use force shall ensure that detailed, accurate reports (arrest, 
detention, or ARJIS-9) describing the force used and all the circumstances and 
facts surrounding the use of that force are prepared, including, but not limited 
to, factors listed in the Force Matrix section of this procedure. In addition, force 
effectiveness statistical data is also collected whenever force is used. To 
facilitate this, officers will complete a Use of Force, BlueTeam entry. 

B. 

Reportable Force 

 

 

 

 

For reporting purposes, the following are considered use of force incidents 
requiring a report: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

7. 

8. 

Any force option, control hold, or weaponless defense technique applied 
to a person, or any force that causes injury or complaint of injury to either 
the officer or the subject being restrained; 

 

Discharge of a firearm in an official capacity; 
 
Discharge of a Taser; 
 
Use of the baton, police nunchaku (OPN), or other impact weapons 
where the suspect has been struck; 
 
Use of any type of chemical agent (mace, OC, etc.); 
 
Use of carotid restraint; 
 
Use of a police service dog, when a bite or other injury occurs; 
 
Use of a cord cuff; 
 
 
 

DP 1.04 - Use of Force 1/23/20198 of 119. 

10.

13. 

Use of a safety control chair, as outlined in Department Procedure 
6.01, Handcuffing, Restraining, Searching, and Transporting 
Procedures; 

 

Use of restraint car seats, as outlined in Department Procedure 
6.01, Handcuffing, Restraining, Searching, and Transporting 
Procedures; 
 

 
Use of “specialty munitions,” as defined in Department Procedure 
1.36, Use of Specialty Munitions; and, 
 
The pointing of a firearm at a person to gain compliance. 

11.  When the officer overcomes physical resistance to applying the handcuffs; 

Officers who use a force option shall personally prepare the appropriate report 
(arrest, detention, ARJIS-9) documenting their use of force. An exception to 
an officer personally preparing a document (detailing force used) is if an 
SDPD investigator interviews the officer and his/her statements (regarding the 
force used) are documented in the investigator’s report. 

In the event San Diego Police Department officers are involved in a situation 
with an outside agency, the SDPD officer responsible for writing the report shall 
request documentation describing the outside agency officers/deputies use of 
force options. 

 
E.  Whenever physical force used by an officer results in an injury that 

necessitates medical treatment of any person, the officer shall immediately 
contact a field supervisor (Refer to Department Procedure 6.01, Handcuffing, 
Restraining, Searching, and Transporting Procedures).

The field supervisor shall evaluate the circumstances surrounding 
the incident. 
 
When appropriate, the field supervisor shall notify the Watch 
Commander and/or field lieutenant. 
 
If the Watch Commander or field lieutenant deems the incident to be 
of significant magnitude, Internal Affairs will be notified and given 
the opportunity to respond and conduct an on-scene investigation. 
 
If Internal Affairs responds to the scene, the Watch Commander shall 
immediately telephone the Police Officers' Association and report the 
general nature of the incident. 
 
All statements made by the subject regarding his/her alleged or 
apparent injury should be documented. 

DP 1.04 - Use of Force 1/23/20199 of 11 
6. 

Photographs shall be taken to document the existence or absence of 
injury to the subject, officers, or other persons. Photographs shall also be 
taken of any damage to the clothing or personal property of the subject, 
officers, or other persons at the scene. The photographs shall be 
impounded as evidence. 

 
 
VII.  ASSEMBLY BILL 953 
 

NEW 

Assembly Bill 953 (AB 953), also known as the Racial and Identity Profiling Act (RIPA) of 
2015, requires law enforcement agencies to collect data on all stops, detentions, and searches.  
This includes consensual searches and instances where force was utilized.  In order to capture this 
data, a new application will be available for every event generated through the Department’s 
MPS and Intranet systems beginning July 1, 2018.  There is a template to collect the required data 
in the F: Drive under Templates/Patrol Based Forms/PD-953, if the database application is 
temporarily unavailable. The data documented on this form shall be entered into the electronic 
application prior to the end of officer’s shift unless exigent circumstances exist.  

Under this mandate, the data collected will include the date, time, and duration of the stop, the 
location, perceived race or ethnicity, perceived gender, perceived LGBT, perceived or known 
disability, English fluency, perceived age, and the reason for the stop, detention, or search. The 
reason for the stop may be generated from a call for service, a traffic violation, reasonable 
suspicion or knowledge that the person was engaged, or about to engage in criminal activity and 
conclude with the actions taken by the officer.  These actions will describe the basis of the search, 
whether or not contraband or other evidence is discovered, the reason for and type of property 
seized and the results of the stop or detention.  The data collected under RIPA replaces the data 
previously collected from vehicle stop data cards.

B. 

A.  When completing a detention and/or arrest report, officers will ensure the 
narrative includes that a RIPA entry was submitted for every person being 
arrested or detained.   

Supervisors will verify officers have documented the RIPA entry in their narrative 
prior to approval.
