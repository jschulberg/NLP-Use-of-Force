23.001 Purpose (1.2.2) 
 

 

23.002 Philosophy 
 

A.  The policies of the Glendale Police Department regarding the use of physical 

force, less lethal and lethal weapons and equipment, deadly force, and 
discharging firearms will be set forth in this order.  Each sworn officer, 
employee, and police recruit will have access to this order and will be 
instructed in these applicable policies before employing any of the weapons or 
tactics set forth herein.  Only department-issued or approved weapons, 
equipment, and chemical agents will be authorized. 

B.  These policies are intended to provide guidance to employees in carrying out 
public safety activities and the mission of the department.  They are definitely 
not intended to be standards of conduct that, if breached, expose employees to 
civil liability because to do so would seriously undermine the department’s 
ability and motivation for writing policy and severely restrict employee 
discretion. 

A.  Response to Resistance:  It is the philosophy of the Glendale Police 

Department to use only the amount of force or control reasonably necessary to 
conduct lawful public safety activities and the mission of the department.  The 
method of force/control used is predicated on the circumstances of the contact 
and the amount of resistance presented by the suspect.  Employees will only 
use the amount of force/control reasonably necessary to overcome this 
resistance, protect property, and save lives.  Under no circumstances will the 
force/control used be greater than necessary to achieve lawful objectives.  
Deadly force should not be used unless an employee reasonably believes it is 
necessary to protect the employee or other persons from imminent danger of 
death or serious physical injury. 
 

B.  Use of Physical Control/Force and Less Lethal Weapons: (1.2.2) 

It is the philosophy of the department to use only the amount of control/force 
necessary to conduct lawful public safety activities and missions of the 
department.  The type and method of control/force will be only that which is 
reasonable and necessary based upon the circumstances.  

C.  Use of Deadly Physical Force: (1.2.2)  It is the philosophy of the department 
to use deadly physical force only to overcome an attack, which could produce 
serious physical injury or death to the employee or to another person, where 
no other means are reasonably available to overcome the attacker.  Any other

use of deadly physical force will be presumed to be a deviation of policy and 
as such, the employees must substantiate the necessity for the use of the 
weapon and/or force. 

In situations where the employee must overcome an attack that the employee 
reasonably believes would produce serious physical injury or death to the 
employee or another person, the employee may resort to any method to 
overcome the attack.  Once the situation has stabilized and the threat of 
serious physical injury or death is past, the employee must once again 
immediately resort to approved less-lethal force tactics. 

 
23.003 Definitions (1.2.2) (1.3.6.d) 
 

A.  Deadly or Lethal Physical Force:  Any control tactic or response to resistance, 

which by its design or intended use could produce serious physical injury or death 
to an employee or to another person.  Deadly force does not include the discharge 
of a firearm for training or qualification, hunting or sporting events, test firing in 
the Crime Lab, dispatching of injured animals, or SWAT tactical extinguishing of 
lights or any other circumstances or situations as directed by a member of senior 
staff. 
 

B.  Deadly Force Incident:  All instances in which an officer uses deadly 

force/control in the line of duty or when acting in a law enforcement capacity. 
 

C.  Deadly Weapon:  Anything designed for lethal use in a lethal manner, including 

a firearm. (1.2.2) 
 

D.  Dangerous Instrument: means anything that under the circumstances in which it 
is used, attempted to be used or threatened to be used is readily capable of causing 
death or serious physical injury. 
 

E.  Empty Hand Control:  A method of control employed by officers without the 
aid of equipment or weapons.  There are two subcategories called “soft empty 
hand techniques” and “hard empty hand techniques”. 

F.  Hard Empty Hand Techniques:  The subcategory in the “empty hand control” 
that includes kicks, punches, or other striking techniques such as a brachial stun, 
or other strikes to key motor points that have a moderate chance of injury.

G.  Soft Empty Hand Techniques:  The subcategory in the “empty hand 

control” that includes escort control holds, touch pressure points, and take 
down techniques that have a minimal chance of injury. 

H.  Extended Range Impact Weapon:  Less Lethal weapon that deploys a 

launched kinetic impact round through the use of a shotgun. 
 

I.  Impact Weapons:  Authorized department equipment for which the officer 
has received training in techniques for striking an aggressive violator.  This 
method of control/force includes tools like the less lethal extended range 
impact weapons, side handle baton, straight baton, and expandable baton.  
(1.2.2) 

J.  Intermediate Weapons:  The method of control employed by officers that 

include the use of authorized or improvised weapons for which the officer has 
been trained.  Some of the weapons are OC spray, TASER, impact weapon 
strikes, less lethal extended range impact weapons, light and sound diversion 
device, and canines. (1.2.2) 

K.  Less Lethal:  The application of force and/or tactics, that when properly 

applied, are not likely to result in death or serious physical injury.  Approved 
less lethal weapons include:  Less lethal extended range impact weapons, 
Herstal FN-303, 37mm munitions, chemical weapons, noise flash diversion 
devices, and electronic control device such as Taser.  Only those techniques 
that are taught by AZPOST, Academy, and department instructors should be 
used. 
 

L.  Officer Presence:  The method of control/force which includes the mere 
presence of an officer in uniform and/or identified by a badge, police 
identification, police vehicle, or other form of police identification such as a 
raid jacket. 

M. Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Spray:  Authorized department organically based 

pepper spray, less lethal weapon. (1.2.2) 

N.  Preclusion:  Elimination of all lesser means of control/force.  The lesser 

means of control/force have been tried and they have not been effective, or the 
type of resistance is greater than the method of control/force.

O.  Progression of Force/Control:  Increasing the amount of control/force used 
until a level is reached, which enables the employee to control the subject 
and/or situation in a safe manner. 

P.  Reasonable Belief:  The conclusion based upon facts and/or totality of the 
circumstances that a reasonable police officer would believe to be true. 

Q.  Serious Physical Injury:  Any physical injury, which causes serious and 

permanent disfigurement, serious impairment of health, or loss or protracted 
impairment of the function of any bodily organ or limb.  

R.  Response to Resistance Reporting:  The inclusion in a department offense 
report narrative and check box sections of the specific actions of a violator, 
which resulted in the method of control/s by the officer.  The officer will also 
accurately document their actions taken to overcome the type of resistance of 
the violator, to effect the arrest, or to protect life or prevent injury.  Lastly, the 
narrative should include a description of the observable injuries and the 
injuries claimed by the violator. (1.3.6.d) 

S.  Verbal Control/Force:  The method of control/force that includes instruction 
or direction from an officer in the form of verbal statements or commands. 

 

 

 

23.004 Methods of Response to Resistance (examples) (1.2.2) (1.3.6.d) 
 

A.  Officer Presence:  Presence is established through the identification of 

authority, which includes, but is not limited to, the mere presence of an officer 
in uniform, identification by a badge, police ID, police vehicle, and/or raid 
jacket.  The presence of a canine is also an example of officer presence.  

B.  Verbal Control - Persuasion, Negotiation, or Command:  Includes 

instruction or direction from an officer in the form of a verbal statement(s) or 
command(s).  An example of Verbal control is an officer's communication 
with a subject that results in the officer controlling the actions of the subject. 

 
C.  Chemical Agents: (1.2.2) The use of chemical agents is considered a less 

lethal tactic.  Oleoresin Capsicum (Cayenne Pepper) is a less lethal weapon 
designed to disrupt the intended thought process, with no lasting after effects.  
Oleoresin Capsicum is commonly referred to as OC, MACE, and pepper 
spray.

D.  Soft Empty Hand Techniques: (1.3.6.d) Includes control/force and restraint 
defensive less lethal tactics that have a minimal chance of injury.  Soft empty 
hand techniques include, but are not limited to: 

 

1.  Wrist Locks 
2.  Joint Locks 
3.  Pressure Points 

E.  Electronic Control Device: (1.2.2) The use of a TASER is considered a less 
lethal tactic.  It is designed for pain compliance or confuses the signals going 
from the brain to the voluntary muscles and thereby achieves incapacitation 
without harming the human body. 
 
1.  Taser:  Less than lethal defensive tactics may be used in situations that are 

consistent with departmental training guidelines, to include: 

 

a.  Threaten Use of Taser 
b.  Display (laser) 
c.  Arc Taser (cartridge removed) 
d.  Drive Stun 
e.  Three Point Drive Stun 
f.  Deployment   

 
F.  Hard Empty Hand: (1.3.6.d) Arrest tactics that are considered less lethal 

tactics, referred to as personal weapons.  Examples of hard empty hand arrest 
tactics are as follows:  

1.  Fist, Palm Heel, Knee, and Elbow Strikes 
2.  Shin, Bicycle, Hip Thrust, and Snap Kicks   
 
These techniques have a probability of injury and should be avoided unless all 
lesser means of force/control and procedures have been attempted, or are not 
possible or reasonable; to prevent injury to the officer and the subject(s) 
involved.  Employees should not purposely strike suspects in the face or head, 
except in situations where the suspect has become assaultive/aggressive 
toward the officer, due to the high probability of injury. 

G.  Intermediate Weapons - Less Lethal Defensive Tactics: (1.2.2) 

1.   Police Baton (Straight or Expandable):  A police baton may be used if 

empty-hand control techniques have failed, are not possible, or a baton is

necessary and reasonable under the circumstances.  Passive resistance or 
resistance such as a prisoner's refusal to enter a police vehicle or holding 
room, let go of a railing, etc. is not sufficient in and of itself to justify the 
use of baton strikes.  A police baton will permit officers to defend 
themselves or others in situations where the use of deadly force may not 
be justified or necessary.  When the use of the baton is warranted, officers 
will attempt to impact the suspect per policy.  Employees will not 
purposely strike or jab suspects on the head, neck, sternum, spine, groin, 
or kidneys unless faced with a deadly force situation. 

2.   Flashlights:  Flashlights are not designed as an impact weapon, however, a 

flashlight may be used in a baton-like manner if empty-hand control 
techniques have failed or are not possible under the circumstances and a 
baton is not readily available.  Employees will not purposely strike or jab 
suspects on the head, neck, sternum, spine, groin, or kidneys unless faced 
with a deadly force situation.  (1.2.2) 

3.  Less Lethal Shotgun Launched Kinetic Impact Round:  Less-lethal tactic 
where an impact projectile similar to a bean-bag or sock, etc. is fired from 
a departmental shotgun.  Less lethal can be fired in situations that are 
suitable to departmental training guidelines. 

4.  Herstal FN-303:  Less-lethal extended range impact weapons tactic, or OC 

delivery mechanism may be fired in situations that are suitable to 
departmental training guidelines. 

5.  Canines:  Canines, properly employed, are considered a less-lethal tactic.  
Police canines will not be used in any circumstances where a strong 
potential exists for discrediting the department. 

 

a.  Canines may be used to search for or apprehend felony suspects when 
use of other methods is impractical, or when public or officer safety is 
threatened sufficiently to justify this method of force.  Canines may be 
used to search for misdemeanor suspects, however, the animal will 
remain leashed unless officer safety is threatened. 

 
b.  Whenever time and circumstances permit, a verbal warning will be 
given to a suspect before unleashing the canine to conduct a search.  
An announcement identifying police authority and giving directions to 
the suspect should be made in addition to stating that the canine will 
be released if the suspect fails to comply.

c.  Detailed procedures for canine use are found in Operations Order 

#51.150. 

H.  Deadly Force:  In situations where the employee must overcome an attack 

that the employee reasonably believes would produce serious physical injury 
or death to the employee or another person, the employee may resort to any 
method to overcome the attack (see #23.002.C).  Examples: 

 

1.  Police Vehicles:  Use of police vehicles against persons could be 

considered use of deadly force, if the vehicle was used as a method of 
control/force as outlined in #23.004.H. 

2.  Discharging of Firearms:  Lethal defensive tactics may be used in 

situations that are consistent with Departmental training guidelines. 

 

  

23.005 Guidelines on use of Response to Resistance and Less-Lethal Weapons (1.2.2) 
 

A.  Oleoresin Capsicum Spray:  Oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray may be used 
when physical force is necessary and justified to subdue a person who is 
threatening, resisting, rioting, interfering with an arrest, or to prevent the 
possibility of injury to any person.  OC spray may also be used to ward off 
threatening dogs or other animals and in tactical building entries such as 
search warrants. 

1.  All uniformed officers below the rank of Lieutenant and civilian detention 

employees will be trained in the use of OC spray. 

2.  Other civilian employees and certified officers above the rank of sergeant 

may receive training in the use of OC spray. 

3.  Once the employee is departmentally trained and issued OC spray, it 
becomes mandatory equipment, unless the employee receives written 
permission/direction from their Division Commander indicating that the 
OC spray may not be worn.  This document will be permanently stored in 
the employee’s personnel file, and forwarded to the Training Unit. 

4.  Sworn employees in plainclothes may carry approved OC spray as readily 

available as their weapon. 

5.  Carrying OC spray is optional for department employees assigned to 

undercover operations.

B.  Use of Oleoresin Capsicum Spray:  Employees using the issued OC spray 

will direct a one-second burst into the face of the suspect.  The suspect should 
then be immediately handcuffed and moved to a well-ventilated area. (1.2.2) 

 

1.  Use of Stream:  Minimum application distance is 24 to 36 inches, as the 

Oleoresin Capsicum may not atomize at shorter distances and the 
maximum accuracy distance is 12 feet. 

 
2.  Use of Foam / Fog:  Minimum application distance is 24 to 36 inches, as 
the Oleoresin Capsicum may not atomize at shorter distances and the 
maximum accuracy distance is 4-8 feet. 

3.  Decontamination:  Warm water can be used to flush the eyes without 

rubbing.  Suspects should recover within 45 minutes; however, intense 
sensation of skin burning may persist 30 to 90 minutes after exposure to 
OC spray.  If water is not readily available, the Fire Department will be 
summoned to the scene. 

4.  Salve or ointments should not be used on affected areas. 

5.  Employees who have used OC spray will not leave a suspect unattended 
and will continue to provide post-use care of the suspect until the suspect 
has recovered from the effects of the spray. 

6.  Should a suspect exposed to OC spray complain or display any severe or 
abnormal reaction to OC spray at any time, the Fire Department will be 
immediately summoned to the scene. 

7.  Employees will avoid laying suspects on their stomach in a prone position 
for any length of time as this can contribute to positional asphyxiation. 

C.  Tactical Size Oleoresin Capsicum Spray (1.2.2) 

1.  Only officers and supervisors of SIU, SWAT, MFF and Canine Officers, 
in addition to Patrol Supervisors, will be authorized to carry department-
issued tactical size OC spray (example –Mark 9).  Supervisors may give 
tactical size OC spray to an officer to deploy in a tactical field force 
situation. 

 
2.  Employees using tactical size OC spray will direct a 1-second burst into 
the face of the suspect from a minimum distance of 15 feet.  The suspect

should then be immediately handcuffed and moved to a well-ventilated 
area.  Decontamination procedures for tactical size OC spray are the same 
as those used for the issued OC spray. 
 

3.  Employees using tactical size OC spray in a riot control situation should 
direct the spray face level, from a minimum distance of 15 feet, into the 
crowd until the desired effect is achieved. 

 

D.  Tactical Chemical Agents (1.2.2) 
 

1.  Chemical agents (example-CS gas) are man-made chemical or organic 

mixtures that are designed to cause lachrymation (uncontrollable tearing), 
irritation, inflammation, or a combination of any of the three.  Chemical 
agents are minute solid particles that are deployed in a variety of 
munitions, including spray, ferret rounds, 37mm, and other conventional 
delivery systems.  Decontamination procedures for tactical size OC spray 
are the same as those used for the issued OC spray. 

2.  Tactical chemical agents by design are considered less-lethal weapons.  

There is, however, a possibility of serious allergic reaction in some people.  
Small children or persons with respiratory health problems can develop 
serious illness after exposure. 

3.  A CID Sergeant, Patrol Sergeant, SWAT Sergeant, or higher-ranking 
department supervisor may authorize use of tactical chemical agents.  

E.   Electronic Control Devices: (1.2.2) This policy establishes guidelines for the 

training, use, and documentation of electronic stun/control devices. 

1.  The only authorized electronic stun/control devices will be Department 
purchased Tasers.  The units will be carried on the duty belt or approved 
outer vest carrier (molly system only) in a department issued holster.  In 
either case, the device will be located on the support side of the officer.  
No officer will be permitted to carry the device on duty without successful 
completion of a training program. 

2.  On successful completion of a training program the Taser electronic 

control device will be issued equipment and mandatory to carry unless 
assigned in a non-uniform capacity.

3.  Definitions: 

 
a.  “Deployment” – defined as the actual firing of probes from the Taser 

at an intended target. 

 
b.  “Use” – defined as utilizing an electronic control device in a drive-stun 
capacity to gain compliance by placing the device in direct physical 
contact with the intended target. The Three Point Drive Stun, by 
deploying of both probes directly into a subject from 2 to 3 inch from 
subject to gain compliance, followed up with a drive-stun if needed to 
create N.M.I. (Neuromuscular Incapacitation). 

 
c.  “Threatened use” – defined as the display of a device’s electrical arc or 

of the red targeting laser dot in an effort to gain compliance. 
Threatened use may also include a verbal warning. 

 
4.  Electronic control devices should be used only against subjects who are 
exhibiting active aggression (physical intimidation) or who are actively 
resisting (defensive resistance, active aggression, aggravated active 
aggression, or attempt to injure self) in a manner that, in the officer’s 
judgement, is likely to result in injuries to themselves or others.  
Electronic control devices should not be used against a passive subject.  
Caution should be used on prolonged exposure with the electronic control 
device.  (1.2.2) 

5.  When deciding whether or not to deploy the Taser, officers shall consider 
the risk of secondary injury caused by the sudden incapacitation of the 
subject.  If the risk of serious physical injury is greater than the need to 
incapacitate, the officer will not use the Taser.  Fleeing should not be the 
sole justification for Taser deployment.  

6.  The Taser will only be used against a “vulnerable person” when the need 
for immediate restraint is evident.  For the purpose of this policy, a 
“vulnerable person” is defined as elderly persons, pregnant females, small 
children, and any other person with a suspected or known medical 
condition that increases the risk of secondary injury due to falling during 
incapacitation. 

 

7.  The Taser should not be deployed under any of the following 

circumstances:

a.  Near FLAMMABLE GASSES or LIQUIDS. 

 

b.  DRUG HOUSES where ether is suspected to be in use. 

c.  Against a DEADLY WEAPON unless lethal coverage is presented by 

another officer or during a rapidly escalated situation where 
insufficient time exists to utilize other force options and the Taser is 
readily available. 

d.  In cases of PASSIVE RESISTANCE unless: 

  The use is reasonable and necessary under the circumstances. 
  A lesser means of control/force has been attempted and failed. 
 

e.  The risk of secondary injury is greater than the need to make an 

immediate arrest.  For example, the subject is in an elevated position 
that could lead to a significant fall, or in a location that could lead to 
the suspect becoming submerged under water, or the subject is 
operating a motor vehicle. 

 
f.  To threaten or attempt to GAIN INFORMATION from a suspect. 

g.  Against a restrained subject (handcuffed, TARPed, or otherwise 

restricted) unless physical resistance has to be overcome and the need 
to overcome the physical resistance by use of the device is reasonable 
and necessary.  This is due to the higher likelihood of secondary injury 
presented by the restraint. 

h.  To wake up a suspected intoxicated individual. 

i.  As a "PROD" 
 

8.  No officer shall playfully, maliciously, recklessly, or intentionally misuse 

the unit in a display of power or against an individual as a punitive 
measure.  Violation of this policy will result in disciplinary action. 
 

9.  The actual deployment and/or use of the TASER will normally require an 
arrest and a supervisor being made aware of the deployment as soon as 
practical.

10.  The Taser should only be used in accordance to training guidelines and 
should not be aimed at the head and neck area of a suspect.  The primary 
target for the Taser probe deployment will be the frontal lower center mass 
of an individual.  The back of an individual is still the preferred target 
area.  Chest shots should be avoided when possible.  Secondary targets 
will include other major muscle groups on the legs and arms. 
 

11.  Post treatment and medical requirements for the Taser: 

a.  If the probes have penetrated the skin, officers will remove the probes 

following training techniques and guidelines. 

 

If the probe(s) penetrated a sensitive/soft tissue area such as the 
face, neck, head, or female/male genitalia, medical personnel will 
remove the probes (paramedic, nurse, EMT, or a physician). 
 

  Once the probes are removed, pictures will be taken of the affected 
area as well as any secondary injuries from the Taser application. 

  The probes, wires and cartridge will be logged into property as 
BIO-HAZARD evidence on all deployments.  The cartridge, 
probes and wire  will be logged in a paper bag in as close to post-
deployment condition as possible for measurement of spooled and 
unspooled wire (Officers should not wrap wire around cartridge). 

  Document treatment in departmental report. 

b.  Medical requirements: 

 
  Whenever the Taser is deployed or used on a person, that person’s 
medical condition will be monitored to ensure the person recovers 
from the deployment or use.  If the person has not completely 
recovered within minutes of the Taser being deactivated, 
emergency medical personnel will be called to the scene to 
evaluate the subject. 
  
If the Taser is deployed or used on a “vulnerable person” as 
defined by this policy, emergency medical personnel will be called 
to the scene to evaluate the condition of the “vulnerable person”.

  All Taser deployments 15 seconds or longer will require an 

immediate medical evaluation. 
 
i.  Repeated and multiple applications. 

ii.  Cycling time that exceeds 15 seconds in duration, whether the 

time is consecutive or cumulative. 
 
Simultaneous applications by more than one ECW. 

 

iii. 
 

12. Reporting requirements 
  

a.  Anytime the Taser is deployed, used, or threatened (with the exception 

of the use of the red targeting laser dot) an offense report will be 
completed listing the person who was subjected to the device as the 
suspect. 

 
b.  The officer who actually deploys, uses, or threatens to use the Taser 
will document the use of force on either an offense report or a 
supplemental report utilizing the provided use of force checkboxes and 
detailing the use of force in a narrative. 

 
c.  After the deployment or use of the Taser, the officer will have the 
deployment or use information downloaded from the Taser by 
specified Departmental personnel. This download must be completed 
before the end of the officer’s work-week.  A copy of this downloaded 
information will be submitted to the Records Unit as a support 
document to the original offense report. 

F.   TARP (Total Appendage Restraint Procedure) (1.2.2) 

1.  The restraint will be a Department issued restraint and will be used in 

accordance with current training practices. No officer will be permitted to 
carry the device on duty without successful completion of a training 
program. 

2.  If the TARP restraint is used:

b.  Once the TARP restraint has been utilized, the individual will be 

placed in an upright, sitting position if possible.  Officers are reminded 
of the dangers of positional asphyxia.  Any exceptions to this would be 
transportation by a medical unit only. 
 

c.  A supervisor will be notified when a TARP restraint has been used, as 
will any transporting units, or detention personnel, if the suspect is 
booked into jail. 

d.  The incident will be documented appropriately in the narrative section 
of the DR, referring to the restraint as a TARP (Total Appendage 
Restraint Procedure).  The reference to “hobble” and “hog-tying” are 
in-correct terms and should not be utilized to describe the TARP 
restraint. 

G.  Prisoner Restraints 

1.  Use of Restraints: 

a.  To prevent injury or destruction of property by a combative or 

belligerent prisoner, a department issued leg restraint may be used. 
 

b.  Hog-tying, a procedure where the restraint has been wrapped around a 
prisoners feet, and then cinched tightly to the prisoners hands, behind 
their back, should not be used. 

c.  A medical unit may be summoned to transport those prisoners who are 
a risk factor because of their medical condition, or who cannot be 
restrained in a safe and practical manner, in accordance with current 
training practices. 

 
H.  Spit Sock Hood (SSH) - This policy provides the guidelines for the proper 
use of the Spit Sock Hood and the circumstances in which its application is 
authorized. 

1.  Policy 
 

a.  In response to police and detention officers being potentially exposed 
to bodily fluids from being spat upon, the Department authorizes the 
use of the Spit Sock Hood (SSH).  The SSH is designed to be placed 
over the head of an in-custody suspect who is spitting or threatening to

spit at officers or other police personnel.  The SSH deters them from 
spitting but is thin enough to allow the suspect to breath freely and 
communicate. It may also prevent the transmission of blood borne 
diseases, such as HIV, Hepatitis B or C, in the event blood was present 
in their saliva/spit. 
 

2.  Guidelines for use of the Spit Sock Hood (SSH) 

a.  It will only be used for a suspect that is in custody and actively 

spitting, has spat on an officer or other person, or threatens to spit on 
an officer or another person. 

b.  When the SSH is being put on or taken off, caution should be taken to 

stay out of the breathing zone and officers are to wear personal 
protective equipment, including nitrile gloves and eye protection. 

c.  The SSH is to be taken off as soon as it safe to do so.  

d.  The SSH is not to be used on any person that is unconscious, vomiting, 
profusely bleeding from the nose or mouth, or is in respiratory distress.  
In these circumstances, officers should protect their mucous 
membranes (eyes and mouth) by wearing eye wear or a full face 
shield.  

e.  Special precautions, including calling for emergency medical support, 
should be taken in situations where the suspect is exhibiting behavioral 
and psychological problems potentially associated with recent 
drug/alcohol use or due to a mental health issue.    

f.  Anyone wearing a SSH will be continuously monitored and will not be 

left attended.  

g.  Use of the SSH is not considered a use of force, however, your 

supervisor is to be notified and use of the SSH shall be documented 
into the arrest report; include details such as if the suspect spat on the 
officer or if they were about to spit on the officer.  

h.  For patrol personnel, the SSH is to be kept in the police vehicle and 
will not be issued to the individual officer. There will be a supply of 
the SSH’s at the detention facility. 

i.  After a SSH is used it is to be placed in a biohazard bag and disposed 

of per departmental policy.

I.  Police Baton General Information (1.2.2) 

 

1.  Police batons should only be used when elevated methods of control are 
necessary and justified under the circumstances, and lesser means of 
control have been precluded.  Any use of the baton not specifically 
allowed or permitted will have to be justified by the officer based on the 
circumstances that exist. 
  

2.  Employees may carry batons at their discretion.  Employees who elect to 
carry batons must satisfactorily complete a basic baton course, (straight, 
side-handle, or expandable) taught by a department impact weapons 
instructor, or have been previously certified while in the academy.  
Employees not previously certified in basic baton may receive training on 
duty.  If they are unable to complete the training during their assigned 
shift, an authorized off-duty-training program may be utilized. 

3.  The certification for Side-Handle, Straight, and Expandable Batons will be 
an AZ POST/GPD approved course of instruction, and re-certification will 
be by a qualified instructor every two years thereafter.  The re-certification 
will consist of a written test (80% passing score) and a proficiency test at 
an acceptable level. 

J.  Straight Baton:  Officers may carry straight batons at their discretion. When 
the straight baton is carried the baton and the method of carry will comply 
with department uniform policies and the documentation of certification will 
comply with GPD Directives. (1.2.2)  
 

K.  Expandable Baton:  Officers may carry the expandable baton at their own 
discretion.  When the expandable baton is carried the baton and method of 
carry will comply with department uniform policy and the documentation of 
certification will comply with GPD Directives. (1.2.2) 
 

L.  Side-Handle Baton:  Officers may carry the side-handle baton at their own 

discretion.  When the side-handle baton is carried the baton and the method of 
carry will comply with department uniform policies and the documentation of 
certification will comply with GPD Directives. (1.2.2) 
 

M. Use of Police Impact Weapon:  When the police impact weapon is used, it 
will be used in accordance to the training the officer received in the Police 
Academy and/or Continued Officer Training provided by/or authorized by the 
Glendale Police Department.  When used properly, it is an effective defensive

tool for police use when dealing with unarmed assailants and has proven to be 
an effective tool in self-defense where the use of a firearm may not be 
justified or expedient. (1.2.2) 

1.  The Primary Striking Points are nerve groupings located in the large 

muscle groups:  

  RADIAL NERVE 
  MEDIAN NERVE 
  COMMON PERONEAL 
  FEMORAL NERVE 
  TIBIAL NERVE 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 

(Outside forearm) 
(Inside forearm) 
(Outside thigh) 
(Inside thigh above knee) 
(Top of calf) 

2.  The Secondary Anatomical Striking Points are generally a less-lethal 

technique, but may be subject to "serious injury"; Consequently, caution 
should be used in applying force: 

3.  Serious Injury Anatomical Striking Points are areas that have a higher 

potential for serious injury and/or death (Caution and justification must 
be used when striking these areas).  As a general rule, unless lethal 
force is necessary, avoid striking the head and neck areas: 

  SHIN 
 
INSTEP 
  KNEE JOINT 
  ACHILLES TENDON 
  ELBOW 
 
  BACK OF HAND 
  LOWER ABDOMEN

  TEMPLE  
  THROAT 
  HOLLOW BEHIND EAR 
  BACK OF NECK 
  COLLARBONE

  EARS 
  JAW 
  KIDNEY 
  TAIL BONE (COCCYX)  
  GROIN (TESTES) 
  SPINE  
 

M.  Flashlights:  (1.2.2) Flashlights are not designed as an impact weapon, 
however, a flashlight may be used in a baton-like manner if empty-hand 
control techniques have failed or are not possible under the circumstances, and 
a baton is not readily available.  If a flashlight is used as an impact weapon, its 
use is governed under this policy, and the tactics will follow the training 
received for a police baton. 

 
N.  FN 303 Less Lethal Launcher 
 

1.  The FN 303 Less Launcher will only be carried and operated by an 

authorized operator. The operator must attend an Operators Course that is 
authorized by the Training Unit. Only certified and current Instructors on 
the FN 303 Launcher will instruct the course.  Officers attending the 
Operators Course must pass a written test (90%) and the qualification 
course (100%). 
  

2.  Operators of the FN 303 must re-qualify (100%) every year with the

to fire. 
 

4.  Always treat the FN 303 is if it is loaded and operational. 

5.  Point the muzzle in a safe direction at all times. 

6.  Keep your finger out of the trigger guard until you are on target and ready 

7.  Never fire the FN 303 at any person without a lawful objective/purpose. 

8.  Deployment of the FN 303 - When deploying the FN 303, shot placement 

is crucial to prevention of serious injury, therefore:

a.   Depending upon the distance between the operator and subject, FN 
303 projectiles must be targeted at a person’s torso or extremities. 
NEVER TARGET THE HEAD OR NECK. 
   

b.  Although classified as less-lethal device, the potential exists for less-

lethal projectiles to inflict injury when they strike the face, eyes, neck, 
spine, and groin.  Therefore, officers deploying less-launchers will 
avoid intentionally striking those areas. 
  

c.  An operator should maintain a reactionary zone of 3-6 feet between 

the operator and the subject.  If deploying the FN 303 in close combat 
situations (3-12 feet)  between the operator and the subject, the 
recommended primary target area is the subject’s thighs (NOT 
CENTER MASS). 
  

d.  Subject Factors:  children, elderly persons, malnourished and / or 

persons with specific medical conditions, and developing fetuses may 
be more prone to bone fracture and injury of soft tissues of the thorax 
and abdomen from blunt force trauma. 
 

e.  Operators should fire two rounds and then re-evaluate the threat. Then 
if needed, fire additional rounds.  Most individuals tend to bend over 
and turn after being struck with a projectile.  Be prepared to aim lower 
on follow-up rounds in order to avoid the head and neck. 
  

f.  When deploying the FN 303, give loud verbal commands and allow a 
few seconds for the projectiles to take effect before the team moves in 
to make an apprehension. 
  

9.  Special precautions should be taken in situations where the suspect is 

exhibiting behavioral and psychological problems potentially associated 
with recent drug/alcohol use or due to a mental health issue. 

    

10. Whenever the FN 303 is used against a subject, a supervisor will be 

notified. Subjects that have been struck with an FN 303 projectile will be 
examined for any injuries sustained and rendered first aid.  Request 
paramedics to respond if needed. Supervisors will ensure that all reports 
are completed prior to the officer’s end of shift and should notify their 
lieutenant of the deployment.

23.014 Post Lethal Force Trauma and Employee Welfare 
 

A.  Philosophy 

1.  The Glendale Police Department recognizes that the most stressful event 
to be endured in a police career is involvement in a police shooting or 
other use of lethal force. 

2.  The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance for supporting the 

employees who were directly involved in a lethal force incident, in order 
to ensure their well being, as much as possible.  These procedures will be 
referred to as the “administrative post-lethal force process” and are 
intended to compliment the guidelines contained in the Employee Line-Of-
Duty Checklists, should the incident command system associated with 
these checklists be activated. 

B.  Applicability 
 

1.  The contents of this order apply, but are not necessarily limited to the 

following situations: 
 
a.  A Police Officer or armed Detention Officer discharged his or her 

weapon at another person. 
 

means. 

b.  A Police Officer or Detention Officer employs lethal force by other 

c.  A Police Officer or Detention Officer has clearly been subjected to an 

attack perpetrated by a person or persons with the intent to kill.

2.  The provisions of this order also apply to other police employees who are 
witness to the use of lethal force and/or those who provide first aid to an 
injured police employee.  This includes Communications personnel 
(normally the channel one dispatcher) who are involved in a lethal force 
incident by virtue of direct radio contact with involved officers, or 
personnel who were providing close support to that dispatcher during the 
time the incident was transpiring. 

C.  Immediate Concerns 

 

1.  The Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) Coordinator, or 

designee, shall be contacted by the Scene Commander and will respond to 
the location as dictated by the unique dynamics of the incident, such as 
where the involved employees have been assembled. 
 

2.  Involved employees will be briefed on the administrative post lethal force 
process as described below, provided with written information containing 
pertinent information (to which they may want to refer at a later time), and 
assisted in arranging their transportation home at the completion of their 
duties, if such assistance is desired. 

D.  Administrative Post-Lethal Force Process 

1.   There are three phases in the administrative post-lethal force process:  

a.  Decompression - As soon as possible, involved employees will be 

afforded time away from work in order to process emotions to which 
they have may have been exposed, and to reassure family members 
and friends who might have been affected by the incident. 
 

b.  Check up - Prior to returning to duty, employees placed on 

administrative duty, or otherwise directed by their chain-of-command, 
must attend a mandatory visit with a licensed psychologist, contracted 
by the Department. 

 
c.  Return to Duty - The supervisor(s) of affected employees (as outlined 

in paragraph 5b) should be briefed on how to recognize PTSD 
symptoms by the Employee Assistance and Support Coordinator or 
Police Psychologist.  Supervisors are to report to the Police 
Psychologist subsequent behaviors, which may indicate ongoing 
emotional distress.

2.   Decompression:  Administrative Leave 
 

a.  Any employee involved in a lethal force incident, as described above 
in paragraph B.1, will be placed on administrative leave following the 
completion of all necessary interviews. 
 

b.  Employees placed on administrative leave will continue to receive 

their pay and benefits, as if they were at work. 

c.  The period of administrative leave will initially be a minimum of 3 
duty days, to commence at the start of the involved employee’s next 
duty day. 

d.  Employees placed on administrative leave as a result of their 

involvement in an incident covered by this order may request an 
extension of administrative leave, which may be approved by their 
Division Commander, or designee, who will then; 

 

  Notify the involved employee’s supervisor(s) 
  Notify the Patrol Scheduler (if applicable) 
  Notify their respective Assistant Chief 

e.  Employees placed on administrative leave under this order are not 

required to stay at home.  They will be asked provide their preferred 
contact information so that they may be contacted in order to facilitate 
both the investigative and administrative processes that follow lethal 
force incidents. 

3.  Check Up:  A Mandatory Appointment 

 
a.  While on administrative leave, and normally as soon after the incident 
as reasonably possible, the CISM Coordinator, or designee, will advise 
all involved employees on how to make an appointment with the 
licensed psychologist contracted by the Department.  Each employee 
will be provided with the psychologist name; address; phone number; 
and website to assist with scheduling their visit. It is the employee’s 
responsibility to make this appointment.   The criteria for 
psychologists selected for this role shall include: 

  Law enforcement experience and/or exposure that has been 

significant enough to create an advanced awareness of the nature

activities, requirements for service, and even its jargon. 

 
  Specialization in stress related illnesses, including but not 
necessarily limited to, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

 

It is the employee’s responsibility to schedule the appointment 
with the psychologist within 24 hours of being placed on Admin 
Leave. 

 
  Failure to schedule an appointment in a timely manner may impact 
the Division Commander’s decision to extend the Admin Leave 
and may require the employee to use personal leave time until the 
appointment has been scheduled and attended. 

 
  An employee will not be returned to regular duty unless they have 
kept the mandatory appointment.  If an employee refuses to attend 
they may be reassigned to other duties, at the Department’s 
discretion, pending further review. 

c.  The purpose of this appointment shall be strictly for the employee’s 

wellness. 
 

d.  Involved employees may elect to continue visits with the designated 
psychologist.  The first six of these additional appointments shall be 
provided at no cost to the employee.  Members of the employee’s 
immediate family may also use these benefits; however, the total 
number of paid visits per family, including the involved employee, 
shall not exceed six. 
   

e.  The psychologist will email the Assistant Chiefs and the Manager over 
Personnel Management to confirm the employee’s attendance at the 
mandatory appointment.  The appropriate Assistant Chief will notify 
the employee’s Commander upon receipt of the email.  Personnel 
Management will maintain a copy of the email.  

f.  The content of an employee’s conversations with the psychologist will 

be kept confidential, in accordance with ARS 36-517.02.

  The only exception to confidentiality is when a client discloses 

 

information that indicates a clear and imminent danger to self or 
others. 
 
In any case when a client’s condition indicates a clear and 
imminent danger to self or others, potential victims and appropriate 
authorities must be informed. 
 

  Should an involved employee disclose information as outlined 
above, the Division Commander shall be notified and take all 
reasonable and immediately necessary steps in order to inform any 
affected party of possible danger, inform the chain-of-command, 
and determine any further actions to protect all parties. 

4.  Extended Administrative Leave - Administrative leave may be extended 
by the Division Commander for a time not to exceed 4 additional duty 
days when; 

 

 

  An appointment with the psychologist cannot be obtained prior to 

the employee’s scheduled return to duty. 

 
  The employee requests additional time for reasons of mental health 

or preparedness for duty. 

a.  If after a reasonable interval of administrative leave, an employee is 
not ready to return to full duty, the possibility of modified duty in an 
appropriate capacity may be explored. 
 

b.  Employees desiring additional time off past the maximum allowed 
Admin Leave time will have the option of using personally accrued 
leave time (vacation, compensatory time, sick). 
 

c.  Prior to exercising any of the options outlined above, the employee 

will be required to speak with their Division Commander about their 
plan for getting themselves to a point where they are ready to return to 
their regular duty assignment. The plan should include; 

  A second mandatory meeting with the psychologist 

  An estimated timeline describing the process for getting back to a 

regular duty assignment

  Detailed information on what will be done in the event the initial 

plan cannot be achieved 

5.  Return to Duty 

 

a.  Preparation – When applicable, the Rangemaster will contact the 

officer on Admin Leave and work with them to schedule them for re-
qualification.  The employee must re-qualify prior to going back to 
their regular duty assignment. 

b.  The CISM Coordinator, or designee, will contact the supervisors of 
involved employees and provide information about recognizing 
symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and other 
possible stress reactions that include the following: 

 

  Supervisors should be attentive to any increase in an involved 
employee’s use of sick, vacation, or compensatory time. 
 

  Supervisors should also be on alert for an employee’s involvement 

in disciplinary issues which would have been considered a 
deviation from their behavior prior to the incident.  Incidents 
should be documented and monitored through the AIMS system. 

  Should trend in leave usage or discipline patterns be noted, 

supervisors should attempt to ascertain the reason for the change.  
If an involved employee is having difficulty as the result of the 
incident in which they were involved, an offer of help should be 
extended and the CISM Coordinator or contracted psychologist 
should be contacted for advice pertaining to resources available.
