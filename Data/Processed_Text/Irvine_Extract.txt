Use of Force 
3.00.00 

 
3.00.00.010 INTRODUCTION 
While in the performance of official duties, the use of force may be necessary to maintain order, 
enforce the law, and protect life and property. Legal limits have been placed on police use of force 
to ensure the rights of individuals. The purpose of this policy, and those following in this section, is 
to establish guidelines for the reasonable use of force by department personnel. 
 
Given that no policy can realistically predict every possible situation an officer might encounter 
in the field, it is recognized that each officer must be entrusted with well-reasoned discretion in 
determining  the  appropriate  use  of  force  in  each  incident.  While  it  is  the  ultimate  objective  of 
every law enforcement encounter to minimize injury to everyone involved, nothing in this policy 
requires an officer to actually sustain physical injury before applying reasonable force. 
 
3.00.00.020 FORCE DEFINED 
Force is defined as the power used to obtain compliance with the law or control of a situation. This 
power includes more than physical action. Verbal commands or the mere presence of the officer 
often may be sufficient to control a situation. However, physical force may be required to safely 
obtain compliance or gain control of a situation. 
 
3.00.00.030 FORCE OPTIONS 
Force options are choices available to a police officer concerning the methods available to control 
a suspect. These force options may include the controlling of a suspect through advice, warning, 
persuasion and the use of physical force. The use of physical force is sometimes necessary for 
the  protection  of  the  public,  the  suspect  and/or  the  officer.  When  physical  force  is  applied,  the 
officer may be required to escalate or de-escalate the force used depending on the suspect's level 
of  force  or  resistance.  An  officer’s  selection  of  a  force  option  or  the  amount  of  force  should  be 
based  on  the  degree  of  resistance  of  the  suspect  as  well  as  other  relevant  conditions  or 
circumstances of the specific situation. 
  
Every situation is unique, and an officer may be required to initiate force at any level, however, the 
following  force  options  should  be  used  as  a  guideline  for  determining  the  reasonable  options 
available. 
a.  Officer  Presence:  An  officer's  presence  alone  is  a  form  of  power  and  control.  An  officer's 

authority and uniform are frequently enough to bring about order or compliance. 

b.  Tactical Communications: Effective communications are a basic element of the use of force. A 
major  goal  of  law  enforcement  is  to  generate  voluntary  compliance  without  resorting  to 
physical force. This may include persuasion, advice and warnings.  

c.  Controlling Force: This is the lowest level of physical force and the goal is the application of 
pain  without  injury  to  gain  compliance.  This  would  include  such  tactics  as  firm  grip  control, 
escort holds, and compliance holds. 

d.  Intermediate  Force:  This  involves  the  use  of  the  baton,  Taser,  less  lethal  devices,  carotid 
control  hold,  chemical  agents  and  any  other  available  instrument  or  tactic  that  may  result  in 
injury to the suspect. This level of force should only be used when a suspect fails to submit to 
Controlling  Force  techniques  or  when  Controlling  Force  tactics  reasonably  appear  to  be 
inappropriate. 

e.  Lethal Force: This is the ultimate use of force, which generally refers to the use of firearms. 
However,  any  use  of  force  that  creates  a  substantial  risk  of  causing  death  or  serious  bodily

injury  may  be  considered  lethal/deadly  force,  and  should  only  be  used  by  an  officer  when  it 
reasonably appears objectively reasonable: 
1.  To protect himself/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an 

immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury. 

2.  To prevent a crime where the suspect’s conduct places a person or persons in danger of 

death or serious bodily injury. 

3.  To apprehend a fleeing felony suspect if: 

a. There is reasonable cause to believe the suspect has committed a crime involving the 
infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury, AND 
b. The suspect would pose a continuing threat to officers or the community, AND 
c.  Deadly force appears necessary to prevent escape, AND 
d.  A verbal warning should be given where it is practical under the circumstances. 

 
3.00.00.040 “REASONABLENESS” OF FORCE 
Any  peace  officer  who  has  reasonable  cause  to  believe  that  the  person  to  be  arrested  has 
committed a public offense may use reasonable force to affect the arrest, to prevent escape, or 
to  overcome  resistance.  A  peace  officer  who  makes  or  attempts  to  make  an  arrest  need  not 
retreat  or  desist  from  his/her  efforts  by  reason  of  resistance  or  threatened  resistance  of  the 
person  being  arrested;  nor  shall  such  officer  be deemed the  aggressor  or  lose  his/her  right  to 
self-defense  by  the  use  of  reasonable  force  to  effect  the  arrest  or  to  prevent  escape  or  to 
overcome resistance (Penal Code §835(a)). 
 
Officers shall use only that amount of force, which is “objectively reasonable” to effectively bring 
an  incident  under  control.  “Reasonableness”  of  the  force  used  must  be  judged  from  the 
perspective of any objectively reasonable officer on the scene at the time of the incident. When 
evaluating  the  “reasonableness”  of  force  options,  a  number  of  factors  should  be  taken  into 
consideration. These factors include, but are not limited to: 
a.  The conduct of the individual being confronted as reasonably perceived by the officer at the 
time.  This  may  include  passive  and  active  resistance,  combative  resistance  and  life 
threatening resistance; 

b.  Officer/subject  factors  (age,  size,  relative  strength,  skill  level,  injury/exhaustion,  number  of 

officers vs. subjects); 
Influence of drugs/alcohol (mental capacity); 

c. 
d.  Proximity of weapons; 
e.  The  degree  to  which  the  subject  has  been  effectively  restrained  and  his/her  ability  to  resist 

despite being restrained. 

f.  Availability of other options (resources reasonably available); 
g.  Seriousness of the suspected offense or reason for contact with the individual; 
h.  Officer’s training and experience; 
i.  Potential for injury to bystanders, officers and suspects; 
j.  Risk of escape; 
k.  Other exigent circumstances. 
 
It is recognized that officers are expected to make split-second decisions and that the amount of an 
officer’s  time  available  to  evaluate  and  respond  to  changing  circumstances  may  impact  his/her 
decision. While  various  degrees  of  force  exist,  each  officer  is  expected  to  use  only  that  degree  of 
force reasonable under the circumstances to successfully accomplish the legitimate law enforcement 
purpose in accordance with this policy.

It  is  recognized  however,  that  circumstances may  arise in  which officers  reasonably  believe  that  it 
would be impractical or ineffective to use any of the standard tools, weapons or methods provided by 
the Department. Officer may find it more effective or practical to improvise their response to rapidly 
unfolding conditions they are confronting. In such circumstances, the use of any improvised device 
or  method  must  nonetheless  be  objectively  reasonable  and  utilized  only  to  the  degree  reasonably 
necessary to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose. 
 
Duty  to  Intercede:  Any  officer  present  and  observing  another  officer  using  force  that  is  clearly 
beyond that which is objectively reasonable under the circumstances shall, when in a position to do 
so,  intercede  to  prevent  the  use  of  such  excessive  force.  Such  officers  should  also  report  these 
observations to a supervisor without delay. 
 
3.00.00.050 MEDICAL ASSISTANCE 
As  soon  as  it  is  reasonable  under  the  circumstances  to  do  so,  medical  assistance  shall  be 
obtained for subjects who have sustained injury, express a complaint of injury, who have been 
rendered  unconscious,  or  who  have  had  a  carotid  control  hold  applied  to  them.  Refer  to  the 
medical assistance matrix that follows.

3.00.00.060 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES 
Supervisors shall respond to all uses of force and carry out the following responsibilities: 
1. Ensure that the use of force is documented on a Force Evaluation Report (IPD Form 71- 22) 

in addition to all other required reports if applicable; 

2.  Ensure  that  CSI  photographs  will  be  taken  of  the  suspect  if  mandated  by  policy  or  if  the 

suspect has injuries or a complaint of pain; 

3.  Ensure  that  officers  have  included  all  critical  information  in  their  reports  and  that  the 
chronology  and  specifics  for  the  event,  as  well  as  the  people  involved,  are  properly 
documented; 

4.  Ensure  that  all  notifications  are  made  in  accordance  with  Policy  §2.00.14  –  Command 
Notification  Protocol.  In  circumstances  where  a  suspect  has  a  significant  injury  or  is 
hospitalized, the on-duty or on-call command duty officer shall be notified; 

5.  Ensure that  an  assessment  of  the  event  is  completed.  This  assessment  should  include  the 
force options utilized, injuries to the suspect and officers, and an evaluation of the totality of 
the circumstances surrounding the event. This assessment may include, but is not limited to, 
tape  recordings  of  witnesses  and  suspects,  written  statements,  photographs  of  injuries  to 
involved parties, etc. 

 
3.00.00.070 DOCUMENTATION OF USE OF FORCE 
When officers of this Department have employed a force option, reports must include the critical 
information  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  chronology  and  specifics  of  the  events,  as  well  as  the 
people involved, are properly documented. 
 
Supervisory notification shall be made as soon as practical following the application of physical 
force  which  appears  likely  to  have  caused  physical  injury.  All  use  of  physical  force  shall  be 
documented in an appropriate arrest report, crime report, or incident report. Use of the carotid 
control  hold  or  any  particular  weapons,  such  as  chemical  agents,  Taser,  less  lethal  or  impact 
weapon shall also require completion of the Force Evaluation Report (IPD Form 71-22). 
 
3.00.00.080 SUMMARY 
The decision to use force places a heavy responsibility on each officer. While there is no way to 
provide  specific  guidelines  for  every  particular  situation,  officers  are  expected  to  make  every 
effort  to  act  professionally,  impartially  and  safely  when  dealing  with  resisting  suspects  and  to 
use only the amount of force reasonable to deal with the situation.
