# NLP-Use-of-Force
This repository focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis on Police Use of Force Policies. The dataset to these policies can be found [here](http://useofforceproject.org/database).
In this analysis, we use PDF text extraction techniques to build the text datasets that are later used for NLP analysis. In terms of NLP, this project utilizes the following methods:
 - Word Frequency
 - Bi-gram Analysis
 - Tri-gram Analysis
 - Topic Modeling
