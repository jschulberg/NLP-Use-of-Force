2000 USE OF FORCE 
 
2010  GENERAL POLICY 
 

 
2020  DEFINITIONS 

In  accordance  with  the  Law  Enforcement  Code  of  Ethics  and  the  Tucson  Police  Department 
Mission  statement,  it  is  the  sworn  duty  of  every  officer  to  safeguard  and  protect  human  life.   
Members  shall  treat  all  persons  with  respect,  professionalism,  and  courtesy.  If  the  use  of  force 
becomes necessary, members shall use force proportional to the threat.    
 
It  is  neither  the  policy  of  the  Department  nor  the  intent  of  these  General  Orders  that  officers 
unnecessarily or unreasonably endanger themselves or others. The force model is to be used as 
a general guide to using force when necessary.  
 
A  member  who  observes  another  member  using  inappropriate,  unnecessary,  or  unreasonable 
force shall intervene to stop the use of force when there is a reasonable opportunity to do so. A 
member  who  witnesses  inappropriate,  unnecessary,  or  unreasonable  use  of  force  by  another 
member shall report it as soon as practicable to a supervisor. 

 
De-Escalation 
 
De-escalation  is  taking  action  and/or  communicating  verbally  or  non-verbally  during  a  potential 
force encounter to stabilize the situation and reduce the immediacy of a threat so that more time, 
options, and resources are available to resolve the situation using the least force necessary. De-
escalation is also an effort to reduce or end the use of force after a threat has diminished. 
 
When  reasonable,  officers  will  gather  information  about  the  incident,  assess  the  risk,  assemble 
resources, attempt to slow momentum, communicate with the subject, and coordinate a response. 
Officers should use advisements, warnings, verbal persuasion, and other tactics as alternatives to 
higher levels of force. When feasible, an officer may withdraw to a position that is tactically more 
secure or allows greater distance in order to consider or deploy a greater variety of force options. 
 
Force 
 
Any physical effort by a Department member to compel compliance by an unwilling subject.  
 
Lawful Purpose 
 
A use of force must be for a lawful  purpose. Officers may  use force in the  performance of their 
duties to:  
 

  Effect a lawful arrest, detention, or search;  
  Overcome resistance or prevent escape;  
  Prevent the commission of a crime; 
  Defend themselves or others; 
  Gain compliance with a lawful order; or

2000 USE OF FORCE  
                             Issued May 2001 

 

  Prevent a person from injuring himself/herself - however, an officer is prohibited from using 
lethal force against a person who presents only a danger to himself/herself and does not 
pose an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death to another person. 

 
Objectively Reasonable 
 
Officers must make  split-second  decisions  regarding  the  use  of  force  in  circumstances  that  are 
tense,  uncertain,  and  rapidly  evolving.  Reasonableness  of  force  is  based  on  the  totality  of 
circumstances known by the officer at the time force was used. This is an objective standard to be 
judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer rather than with the benefit of hindsight, and 
without regard to underlying intent.  
 
There are many components that factor  into an objectively reasonable decision  to  use  of force, 
including:  
 

  The purpose of the force (Was it lawful?); 
  Efforts to de-escalate the situation; 
  The proportionality of the force being used to the force encountered; 
  The nature and seriousness of the threat being encountered; 
 

If the officer’s actions unnecessarily contributed to the need to use force.  

 
Proportionality 
 
Officers shall balance the totality of the circumstances, known to or perceived by the officer at the 
time, with the severity of the offense committed and the subject’s level of resistance. Proportional 
force does not require officers to use the same type or amount of force as the subject. The more 
immediate the threat and the more likely that the threat will result in serious physical injury or death, 
the greater the level of force that may be proportional, objectively reasonable, and necessary to 
counter it.  
 
Provocation 
 
Provocation includes conduct that may create or contribute to a need to use force that might not 
otherwise be necessary. This can include illegal searches, detentions, and entries to residences.  
It  can  also  include  unprofessional  exchanges  or  other  acts  done  intentionally  or  recklessly  that 
provoke the subject or contributes to the need for force.  This conduct must be documented and 
considered in determining the reasonableness of the force used. 
 
Significant Injury 
 
A significant injury is a physical injury resulting from a use of force that creates a reasonable risk 
of death or causes serious disfigurement, serious impairment of health, or loss or impairment of 
any bodily organ or limb. Examples of significant injury include broken bones, closed head injuries, 
loss  of  consciousness,  impairment  of  a  limb  and/or  any  injury  that  could  result  in  death  or 
disfigurement.  Sutures are not by themselves considered a significant injury but extensive suturing 
may rise to this level depending on the circumstances.

2030  USE OF FORCE PROHIBITED 
 

An officer shall not use physical force:  
 

2000 USE OF FORCE  
                             Issued May 2001 

 

  To punish or retaliate; 
  Against  individuals  who  only  confront  them  verbally  unless  the  vocalization  significantly 
impedes a legitimate law enforcement function creating an immediate safety concern (e.g. 
incitement to violence or destruction of property, threats to officers or others); or 

  On handcuffed or otherwise restrained subjects, except in exceptional circumstances when 
the subject’s actions must be immediately stopped to prevent injury, escape, or destruction 
of property.  In such circumstances, officers shall articulate:  

o  Why force was necessary, and 
o  Why no reasonably effective alternative to the use of force appeared to exist.  

 
2040  FORCE MODEL  

 

This model describes levels of resistance officers may encounter and the levels of force officers 
may use to lawfully overcome that resistance. 
 
Force situations are dynamic and require an officer to continually assess the subject’s actions to 
ensure an objectively reasonable response. Officers may initiate and transition to levels or types of 
force, including attempts to de-escalate, in relation to the amount of resistance offered by a subject. 
Circumstances that influence the level of force used by the officer include, but are not limited to:   
 

  The nature of the offense; 
  The behavior and actions of the subject, such as resistive actions, aggressive acts, etc.; 
  The physical size and conditioning of the subject relative to the officer; 
  The feasibility and availability of alternative responses; and 
  The availability of additional officers. 

Officers shall consider whether a subject’s failure to comply is a deliberate attempt to resist or an 
inability to comply based on factors including, but not limited to:  
 

  Medical conditions; 
  Mental impairment; 
  Developmental disability; 
  Physical limitation; 
  Language barrier; 
  Drug interaction; 
  Behavioral crisis; and 
  Hearing impairment. 

 

 

 

When it is necessary for an officer to exercise physical control of a violent, assaultive, or resisting 
individual to make an arrest or protect others from harm, they shall: 
 

  Recognize that their conduct prior to the use of force, including the display of a weapon, 

may influence the level of force necessary in a given situation;

2000 USE OF FORCE  
                             Issued May 2001 

 

  Exercise  reasonable  care  that  their  actions  do  not  precipitate  an  unnecessary, 
unreasonable, or disproportionate use of force by placing themselves or others in jeopardy, 
or by not following policy or training; and 

  Continually assess the situation and changing circumstances, and adjust the use of force 

appropriately. 

 
2041  Levels of Resistance 

 
The levels of resistance by a subject include: 
 

  Psychological  Intimidation:  Non-verbal  cues  indicating  the  subject’s  state  of  alertness, 

agitation, and physical readiness to resist. 

  Verbal Non-Compliance: Verbal responses indicating the subject’s unwillingness to comply 
with  direction.  This  may  include  verbal  threats  made  by  the  subject.    A  person  has  a 
constitutionally protected right to express verbal protest, and speech directed at an officer 
is generally protected by the First Amendment. However, threats (or “fighting words“) are 
not protected speech. Verbal provocation alone is not justification for a use of force. 
  Passive Resistance: Physical non-compliance that does not directly prevent the officer’s 

attempt at control.  

** A force response to resistance at the psychological intimidation, verbal non-
compliance or passive resistance level shall be limited to verbal direction, 
handcuffing, escort and control holds. ** 

 

 

  Defensive  Resistance:  Physical  actions  that  attempt  to  prevent  the  officer’s  control,  but 

make no direct attempt to harm the officer. 

  Active  Aggression:  Behavior  that  is  a  physical  assault  on  the  officer  where  the  subject 
prepares to strike, strikes, or uses techniques in a manner that may result in injury to the 
officer. 

  Deadly Force: Assaultive acts of aggression directed towards an officer or another that are 

likely to cause serious injury or death. 

 

2042  Levels of Force 
 

The levels of force employed by members are: 
 

  Officer Presence: Authority is established by the officer’s presence in uniform, by verbal 
identification as a peace officer, or by clear display of department badge or identification.    
  Verbal Direction: Communication directed at a subject to control their actions.  Officers will, 
when reasonably possible, attempt to use verbal communication skills to control subjects 
before resorting to physical control methods. 

  Empty Hand Control: Force techniques using the officer’s body without the aid of weapons 

or equipment. Empty hand control is divided into two (2) categories: 

o  “Soft”  control  -  physical  interaction  (except  strikes)  meant  to  separate,  guide, 
and/or  control,  and  that  does  not  cause  injury  greater  than  temporary  pain  or 
redness.   

o  “Hard” control – physical interaction (including strikes) meant to separate, guide, 
and/or control, or which are likely to result in injuries greater than temporary pain 
or redness.

2000 USE OF FORCE  
                             Issued May 2001 

 

 

** The use of vascular neck restraint (carotid) or choke holds are prohibited. ** 
 

** Note: It is understood that the policy regarding the use of vascular neck restraint 
(carotid) or choke holds may not cover every situation that may arise. ** 

 

 

Intermediate  Weapons:  Weapons  that  provide  a  method  of  controlling  subjects  when 
deadly  force  is  not  justified  and  when  empty  hand  control  techniques  are  either  not 
sufficient or not tactically sound. The following are types of intermediate weapons:  

o  Oleoresin  Capsicum  (OC)  spray  –  Shall  only  be  used  to  counter  defensive 

resistance or greater. 

o  PepperBalls  –  Capsules  filled  with  a  capsaicin  powder  and  fired  from  a 
compressed-air powered launcher. PepperBalls may be fired directly at a subject, 
or  may  be  fired  to  strike  near  a  subject  to  deliver  a  dispersed  OC  payload.  
Pepperballs shall only be used to counter defensive resistance or greater. 

o  Impact Weapon – Any object used to strike a subject in a manner that is reasonably 
likely to cause injury. An impact weapon shall only be used to counter defensive 
resistance when the officer’s empty hand control is insufficient to overpower the 
resistance or when the officer is facing greater force. In limited circumstances an 
impact weapon may be used in lieu of OC spray when the properties of OC spray 
would  make  its  use  ineffective  or  dangerous  to  the  officer,  e.g.,  inside  a  small, 
confined area. 

o  Conducted Electrical Weapon (CEW) - Any less lethal conducted energy weapon, 
e.g.,  TASER. The use of CEWs shall be limited to counter  active aggression  or 
deadly force.   

o  Less Lethal Munitions – Kinetic impact or chemical-agent munitions designed to 
disrupt a subject’s threatening action with minimal risk of serious injury or death. 
  Kinetic  impact  rounds  include  Department  approved  flex  batons  and  other 
specialty munitions, e.g., 37 mm foam rounds.  Generally, the use of kinetic 
energy  impact  rounds  shall  only  be  used  to  counter  active  aggression  or 
greater.  However,  kinetic  impact  rounds may  be  used  in  instances  where  a 
subject  is  causing  serious  or  life  threatening  injury  to  him  or  herself  or  is 
immediately threatening to cause such injury, and has the means to do so. 
  Chemical  agents  include  o-chlorobenzylidene  malononitrile  (CS)  and  shall 

only be utilized during tactical team operations or similar deployments.  

  Deadly Force: Force that is likely to cause serious injury or death. Use of a firearm is not 
the only means of employing deadly force. It may become necessary for officers to protect 
themselves or others with means other than a firearm. 

 

2050   POINTING FIREARMS 
 

Officers shall not point a firearm at an individual unless it is reasonable to believe that it is necessary 
to  protect  against  a  potential  use  of  physical  force  or  deadly  physical  force.  Unholstering  or 
displaying  a  firearm,  including  at  a  low-ready  position  without  pointing  it  at  a  person,  does  not 
require a use of force report. Firearms shall be secured or holstered as soon as possible after the 
perceived threat has ended.

2000 USE OF FORCE  
                             Issued May 2001 

 

Deadly  force  is  authorized  when  an  officer  reasonably  perceives  an  imminent  threat  of  serious 
physical injury or death to the officer or another person.  Deadly force is a measure to be employed 
only in the most extreme circumstances when all lesser means of force have failed or could not be 
reasonably employed. 
 
Officers shall, whenever possible, identify themselves as police officers and issue a verbal warning 
prior to using deadly force, unless such identification and warning would jeopardize their safety or 
the safety of another person.   

 
2061  Use of Firearms  

Officers may discharge a firearm: 
 

  During Department qualifications or firearms training at an approved range; 
  For test firing by the Crime Lab; 
  To kill a dangerous or seriously injured animal; or 
  When justified in using deadly force. 

 

 

Officers shall not discharge a weapon: 
 

  As a warning shot; 
  At a moving vehicle; 
  From a moving vehicle. 

** Note: It is understood that the policy in regards to discharging a firearm at or 
from a moving vehicle may not cover every situation that may arise. ** 
 

Officers shall not handle a firearm in a careless or reckless manner. 

 
2070   USE OF FORCE REPORTING, INVESTIGATION, AND REVIEW  
 

The Tucson Police Department recognizes the magnitude of the responsibility that comes with the 
constitutional  authority  to  use  force.  This  responsibility  includes  maintaining  vigorous  and 
transparent oversight systems to ensure accountability and maintain public trust. In order to ensure 
transparency  and  accountability,  all  members  shall  adhere  to  the  reporting  requirements  and 
responsibilities contained in General Orders. 
 
The requirements for reporting, investigating, and reviewing use of force incidents are separated 
into types based on the nature of the incident.  The listed table for Use of Force – Classifications 
and Review Mechanism shall be followed when reporting and documenting the use of force.

not use reportable force.  Witness officers shall: 

o  Ensure that a supervisor is verbally notified of the use of force as soon as practical; 
o  Remain on scene until released by a supervisor; and 
o  Complete accurate written reports documenting the use of force by the end of the 

shift, unless otherwise directed by a supervisor. 

  Supervisor Responsibilities 

Upon being advised of a reportable use of force, a supervisor shall: 

o  When required by GO 2080, respond to the scene of the incident;

                             Issued May 2001 

 

2091   Chain of Command (COC) 

 
The  Tucson  Police  Department  employs  a  variety  of  administrative  review  mechanisms  when 
evaluating  use  of  force  incidents.    These  reviews  are  intended  to  promote  community  trust, 
enhance  transparency,  and  improve  member  safety  by  evaluating  all  aspects  of  an  incident 
including policy, equipment, training, supervision, and members’ actions, including those actions 
leading up to the use of force. 
 

 
Force Types I, II, and III will be reviewed by the COC through at least two levels above the rank of 
the member using force.  Force types II-K9 and III-K9 will be reviewed by the COC through the 
level of Division Commander. The COC will prepare a written report, evaluating: 
 

  Use of Force (reasonableness, necessity, proportionality, and circumstances leading up to 

the use of force); 

  Tactics and decision making (including de-escalation); 
  Supervision; 
  Equipment; 
  Policy compliance; 
  Training; and  
  Reporting and investigation. 

 
2092  Force Review Board (FRB) 
 

The  chain  of  command  investigation  and  findings  of  Force  Types  II-K9,  III,  and  III-K9  will  be 
reviewed  by  the  FRB.    The  FRB  will  review  a  sample  of  Type  II  investigations.  The  Board  will 
prepare a written report to the Chief of Police or designee, evaluating the following: 

  

  Proper categorization of force type; 
  Thoroughness of investigation; 
  Completeness of command review; 
  Proper identification and handling of deficiencies; and 
  Command findings. 

The  FRB  will  not  make  recommendations  concerning  discipline.  In  the  event  that  the  Board 
identifies violations of policy not previously addressed by the COC, the Board will refer the matter 
to the COC or OPS as appropriate for further action.   
 
In  the  event  that  the  Board  identifies  meritorious  behavior  deserving  of  recognition  or  individual 
training opportunities, the Board will refer the matter to the member’s COC for action. 
 
For  specific  details  on  the  FRB  and  use  of  force  reporting,  refer  to  the  Force  Review  Board 
Operations Pamphlet.
