Approved by: 
Chief Rob Heun 

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

1.01.000  Definitions and Scope of Manual  

Definitions:  For purposes of this manual, the following definitions shall apply: 

Command Officer:  The Chief and any officer appointed by the Chief of Police, 
permanently or temporarily, to the rank of Lieutenant or higher. 

Court, Duty Related:  Court responsibilities, Administrative Hearings, official 
conferences, and citizen contacts arising from events that occurred while the 
employee was acting as an official of the Department, whether or not the 
employee was "on-duty" when the event occurred.  Such appearance shall be 
compensated under the terms of the current labor contract. 

Court, Non-Duty Related:  Court, Administrative Hearing, or conference 
responsibilities arising from events that occurred when the employee was not 
acting as an official of the Department, or was acting beyond the scope of his or 
her authority.  Arrangements shall be made by the employee to take leave or be 
on personal time for the court, and no compensation will be made by the 
Department. 

Department:  In its most generic sense, all personnel and operations under the 
Chief of Police's purview.  When "notification" or "approval" of the "Department" 
is required, such notification and/or approval shall be from a Command Officer 
unless a specific procedure provides otherwise (most notably illness notification). 

Employee:  Refers to all personnel employed by the Department, regardless of 
rank, position, assignment, or gender. 

He/Him and She/Her:  Unless specifically applicable, should any pronoun be 
used within this Manual, it is intended to be neutral in gender. 

Just Cause:  An action taken based on fair and honest cause or reason, 
regulated by good faith.  That which, to an ordinary, intelligent person, is 
justifiable reason for taking an action. 

Manual:  Refers to the current "Regulations and Procedures Manual" of the 
Anchorage Police Department. 

May:  Permissive in nature. 

Member:  Synonymous with "employee." 

Officer:  Shall include all sworn personnel of the Department, regardless of rank, 
and reserve or special officers who have been appointed by the Chief of Police. 
This term applies without regard to gender, division, or duty assignment. 

On Duty:  This term refers to those times that employees are acting under color 
of authority, or are expected to be performing assigned duties.  This is distinct 
from "tour of duty," since (1) employees who are on an unpaid lunch period 
during their tour of duty are off duty during that time, and (2) employees who 
have completed their tour of duty may be called upon to act under color of 
authority (as in a home car traffic stop), and are on duty for that time they are 
operating under color of authority.  (See Tour of Duty) 

Prepared to Testify:  Includes the production of specified evidence and a review 
of reports to ensure accurate testimony. 

Superior Officer:  An officer of higher rank.  Descending order of rank is: 

Shall/Will:  Mandatory in nature. 

Should:  Advisory in nature. 

A. Chief of Police 

B. Deputy Chief of Police 

C. Captain 

D. Lieutenant 

E. Sergeant 

F. Patrol Officer/Warrant Officer/Detective (these different job titles share the 
equivalent rank status). 

Superior Officer, Acting:  An officer temporarily filling a superior officer's position, 
assuming all the responsibilities and authority of that rank. 

Supervisory Officer:  An officer appointed by the Chief of Police, either 
permanently or temporarily, to the rank of Sergeant or above.  This definition 
does not coincide with the definition found in AMC 3.70, but serves for the 
purposes of this manual. 

Sworn Personnel:  Synonymous with "officer", ―sworn member‖, or ―sworn 
employee.‖ 

Tobacco and Tobacco Products:  For purposes of these regulations, tobacco and 
tobacco products refer to cigarettes, cigars, chewing tobacco, and products 
substituting for tobacco. 

Tour of Duty:  The entire period of time when an employee is scheduled to 
assume their assigned responsibilities until relieved of those duties, including all 
breaks and meal periods, regardless if those periods are compensated or not. 
(See "On Duty") 

Under Color of Authority:  Any act performed or privilege invoked as a peace 
officer, regardless of location or duty status.  This includes events or situations 
which could reasonably be expected to result in the invocation of police powers 
or duty.  This most commonly includes, but is not limited to, the following: 

A. Use of a home car cannot be done as a private citizen, but is always 
"under color of authority," because its use, regardless of duty status or 
location, reasonably contemplates the possible invocation of police powers or 
duty. 

B. Carrying a department issued weapon whether on or off-duty within the 
municipality or carrying a personally owned weapon where the potential exists 
of using police powers of arrest.  When an employee uses department owned 
equipment or acts on behalf of the department, it is done ―under color of 
authority‖.  This necessitates proper qualification with the firearm and 
compliance with all laws and Departmental procedures governing such 
activity.  

C. Recreational use of a firearm does not reasonably contemplate the 
invocation of police powers, so can be done outside the color of authority as a 
peace officer.  Consequently, hunting and sports firearms are not governed 
by Departmental regulations when handled for such purposes, and not done 
in uniform or in a police vehicle. 

Willfully:  The term "willfully" is used in this Manual to describe intent, similarly to 
the role of intent in criminal law.  Violations of regulations, policies, and 
procedures can be adjudicated by the Department only if the commission or 
omission is done "willfully."  When applied as intent to violate a provision of this 
Manual, "willfully" means that the person either knew or should have known.  Any 
regulation, policy, or procedure, therefore, can be violated maliciously, 
carelessly, and/or negligently, and these conditions are collectively referred to as 

"willfully" for purposes of this Manual or any applicable Departmental manual or 
publication. 

1.01.005  Applicability of Manual 
The regulations and procedures contained herein apply to all personnel under 
the organizational management of the Chief of Police, unless the applicability is 
specifically limited by the nature or language of that particular regulation or 
procedure. 

1.01.015  Subject Matter not Addressed 

Not all subject matter can be covered within this Manual.  Should such a topic be 
encountered, the employee shall be guided by the following: 

A. Some subject matter can be found in other governing documents, such as 
various procedures/regulations manuals of the Municipality and earlier valid 
Departmental directives.  In such instances, those documents shall govern 
the questioned activity. 

B. Some subject matter is not specifically addressed in any document/digest.  
In these instances, that activity shall be guided by accepted past practices or, 
in the absence of past practices, sound judgment and reasonableness. 

1.01.020  Modifications to the Manual 

Duration and Cancellation 

All regulations and procedures contained in the Manual are in effect indefinitely, 
unless cancelled or superseded in accordance with the suspension and 
amendment section below. 

Suspension and Amendment 

No material contained in this Manual may be suspended, modified, or 
superseded by any other publication unless that new document: 

A. Bears the signature of the Chief of Police or Deputy Chief of Police; and 

B. States or substantially implies that it amends the Manual. 

1.01.025  Compliance 
Compliance with All Laws, Oaths, Regulations, and Procedures 

Any employee who: 

A. Willfully violates their oath or trust; or 

B. Willfully violates any law, statute, or ordinance; or 

C. Willfully violates any Department regulation, policy, or procedure; or 

D. Willfully disobeys a lawful order shall be subject to disciplinary action in 
accordance with the provisions established in this Manual. 

Standards of Proof 

The Department shall be held to a standard of just cause when determining if an 
employee has violated any regulation, policy, procedure, law/statute/ordinance, 
or lawful order. 

Department Retains Authority Despite other Dispositions 
Action taken or not taken by any other agency or person does not limit the 
Anchorage Police Department's authority to enforce the material contained in this 
Manual.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

1.02.000  Code of Conduct 

To define departmental expectations for on- and off-duty personal behavior. 

Purpose 

Policy 

The Anchorage Police Department and the public expect all personnel to 
maintain high standards of appearance and conduct.  Law-enforcement officers 
wield considerable power over citizens, power that is carefully circumscribed by 
state and federal law, and the Constitution and Bill of Rights.  Our powers to 
arrest, seize property, and interfere, at times, with the lives of citizens constitute 
a public trust. We can help ensure that we regard this trust as vital by exemplary 
performance. Performance is tied to the department's mission.  The mission is to 
protect and serve our community in the most professional and compassionate 
manner possible. 
Note:  The courts have upheld the prerogative of law-enforcement agencies to 
impose restrictions on the behavior of their employees but these restrictions must 
not infringe on protected, constitutional rights such as the rights to privacy, 
association, and free speech.  The agency should have a rational, non-arbitrary 
reason for its rules or restrictions. 

1.02.005  Definitions 

Moral turpitude:  An intentional act or behavior displayed in words or actions 
which violates public morals or the common sense of the community involving 
but not limited to intent to defraud, intentional dishonesty for personal gain, lying, 
perjury, subornation of perjury, cheating, bribery, unlawful possession of 
controlled substances, sexual harassment, unlawful sexual conduct, or excessive 
use of force. 

Good moral character:  The attributes of a prospective employee that enhance 
his or her value to the department and to public service which include honesty, 
integrity, truthfulness, obedience to the oath of office and the code of ethics, 
respect for authority, and respect for the rights of others. 

Unreasonable Behavior: Behavior that an average person would interpret as 
unacceptable and intended to cause harm to the individual(s) or property. 

Incivility:  Deviant behavior with ambiguous intent to harm; violated workplace 
norms for mutual respect; rude or discourteous acts or the practice of behaviors 
that undermine the credibility  and productivity  of others; hazing. 

Bullying:  Persistent aggressive or unreasonable behavior against a co-worker or 
subordinate. 

Verbal Aggression:  One or more persons making discriminatory or threatening 
comments, yelling, hazing, harassing, tantrums, belittling, cursing, or humiliating 
another person directly or indirectly. 

Physical Aggression:  Throwing objects, violent outbursts (e.g., hitting the wall, 
pounding on desks, damaging property, etc.) and inappropriate touching; any 
physical act that a reasonable person would consider menacing or threatening 
behavior.

1.02.010  Law Enforcement ‗Code of Ethics‘ 

All officers shall display the integrity required by the Law Enforcement Code of 
Ethics: 

―As a law enforcement officer, my fundamental duty is to serve the community; to 
safeguard lives and property, to protect the innocent against deception, the weak 
against oppression or intimidation, and the peaceful against violence or disorder; 
and to respect the constitutional rights of all to liberty, equality, and justice. 

I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all and will behave in a 
manner that does not bring discredit to me or my agency. I will maintain 
courageous calm in the face of danger, scorn or ridicule; develop self-restraint; 
and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others.  Honest in thought and deed in 
both my personal and official life, I will be exemplary in obeying the law and the 
regulations of my department.  Whatever I see or hear of a confidential nature or 
that is confided to me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret unless 
revelation is necessary in the performance of my duty. 

I will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, political beliefs, 
aspirations, animosities, or friendships to influence my decisions.  With no 
compromise for crime and with relentless prosecution of criminals, I will enforce 
the law courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice, or ill will, 
never employing unnecessary force or violence and never accepting gratuities. 

I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith, and I accept it as a 
public trust to be held so long as I am true to the ethics of police service.  I will 
never engage in acts of corruption or bribery, nor will I condone such acts by 
other law enforcement officers.  I will cooperate with all legally authorized 
agencies and their representatives in the pursuit of justice. 

I know that I alone am responsible for my own standard of professional 
performance and will take every reasonable opportunity to enhance and improve 
my level of knowledge and competence. 

I will constantly strive to achieve these objectives and ideals, dedicating myself 
on my honor to my chosen profession… law enforcement.‖

contracts to the contrary, Department personnel shall abide by the following 
when using social media:

citizens on social media sites to the degree that their speech does not 

impair working relationships of this Department for which loyalty and 
confidentiality are important, impede the performance of duties, impair 
discipline and harmony among co-workers, or negatively affect the 
public perception of the Department. 

 
2. As public employees, Department personnel are cautioned that speech 
on- or off-duty, made pursuant to their official duties—that is, that owes 
its existence to the employee‘s professional duties and 
responsibilities—is not protected speech under the First Amendment 
and may form the basis for discipline if deemed detrimental to the 
Department. Department personnel should assume that their speech 
and related activity on social media sites will reflect upon their office 
and this Department. 

 
3. Department personnel shall not post, transmit, or otherwise disseminate 

any information to which they have access as a result of their 
employment without written permission from the chief executive or his 
or her designee.

not to disclose their employment with this Department nor shall they

not to do the following: 

a). Display Department logos, uniforms, or similar identifying items 

on personal web pages. 

 
b). Post personal photographs or provide similar means of personal 
recognition that may cause them to be identified as a police 
officer of this Department. Officers who are, or who may 
reasonably be expected to work in undercover operations, shall 
not post any form of visual or personal identification. 

5. When using social media, Department personnel should be mindful that 

their speech becomes part of the worldwide electronic domain. 
Therefore, adherence to the Department‘s code of conduct is required 
in the personal use of social media. In particular, Department 
personnel are prohibited from the following: 

a). Speech containing obscene or sexually explicit language, 

images, or acts and statements or other forms of speech that 
ridicule, malign, disparage, or otherwise express bias against any 
race, any religion, or any protected class of individuals. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

b). Speech involving themselves or other Department personnel 
reflecting behavior that would reasonably be considered 
reckless or irresponsible. 

6. Engaging in prohibited speech noted herein, may provide grounds for 

undermining or impeaching an officer‘s testimony in criminal 
proceedings. Department personnel thus sanctioned are subject to 
discipline up to and including termination of office. 

 
7. Department personnel may not divulge information gained by reason of 
their authority; make any statements, speeches, appearances, and/or 
endorsements; or publish materials that could reasonably be 
considered to represent the views or positions of this Department 
without express authorization. 

8. Department personnel should be aware that they may be subject to civil 

litigation for 

a). publishing or posting false information that harms the reputation 

of another person, group, or organization (defamation); 

b). publishing or posting private facts and personal information 
about someone without their permission that has not been 
previously revealed to the public, is not of legitimate public 
concern, and would be offensive to a reasonable person; 

 
c). using someone else‘s name, likeness, or other personal 

attributes without that person‘s permission for an exploitative 
purpose; or 

 
d). publishing the creative work of another, trademarks, or certain 
confidential business information without the permission of the 
owner. 

9. Department personnel should be aware that privacy settings and social 
media sites are constantly in flux, and they should never assume that 
personal information posted on such sites is protected.

transmitted, downloaded, exchanged, or discussed in a public online 
forum may be accessed by the Department at any time without prior 
notice.

1.02.015N  Medical Analysis  

The Department recognizes that any medical examination/analysis is a 
significant intrusion into the personal lives of its employees.  However, there are 
occasions when the interests and safety of the public overshadow the personal 
privileges of privacy, and medical examinations and analyses are necessary.  If 
reasonable suspicion exists, an employee may be required to submit to such an 
examination, which can include analysis of blood, breath, and/or urine.  Absent

advances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal or physical conduct of an 
intimate nature such as uninvited touching or sexually suggestive comments." 

II. The Department recognizes that the question of whether a particular action or 
incident is a purely personal, social relationship without a discriminatory 
employment effect requires a factual determination based on all evidence in the 
matter.  Given the nature of this type of discrimination, the Department further 
recognizes that false accusations of harassment, especially sexual harassment, 
can have serious effects on innocent people.  Consequently, members of the 
Department are both encouraged to report any and all incidents of harassment 
immediately, and cautioned that malicious false reports and/or exaggerated

To establish guidelines to protect employees and citizens against sexual 
misconduct as well as to specify courses of action in the case of allegations or an

The Anchorage Police Department has zero tolerance for sexual misconduct of 
any nature by employees, whether on or off duty.   
 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 
 

The public places significant trust and confidence in the Anchorage Police 
Department and, as a result, has an expectation that Department employees, 
both sworn and non-sworn, will conduct themselves lawfully and ethically. It is 
not the intent of the Department to infringe upon the individual civil liberties of 
employees or to intrude into or affect their private lives. It is, however, meant to 
establish the parameters of sexual misconduct and to fully inform employees as 
to their responsibilities relating to those actions which will or may affect their 
continued employment.  
 

DEFINITIONS 

 
Sexual Misconduct:  Sexual misconduct by law enforcement employees is any 
behavior by an employee that takes advantage of the employee‘s position in law 
enforcement to misuse authority and power (including force) in order to commit a 
sexual act, initiate sexual contact with another person, or respond to a perceived 
sexually-motivated cue (from a subtle suggestion to an overt action) from another 
person. It also includes any communication or behavior by an employee that 
would likely be construed as lewd, lascivious, inappropriate, or conduct 
unbecoming an employee and violates general principles of acceptable conduct 
common to law enforcement. In addition, any action where an employee engages 
on or off duty in illegal, prohibited, or otherwise clearly inappropriate sexual 
conduct which may damage public respect for the employee and/or the 
Department. Various forms of sexual misconduct (including criminal acts) could 

be directed at colleagues, citizens, detainees, juveniles, and crime victims or 
witnesses. These forms may include, but are not limited to, the following: 

1.  Sexual contact by force; 
2.  Unwarranted physical contact with citizens (e.g. inappropriate or 

unnecessary searches or pat-downs); 

3.  The use of any information gained while on duty or under the color of 

authority for personal use (e.g. using a phone number given to an officer 
during a traffic stop or on a call to ask someone on a date or engage in a 
personal conversation). 

4.  Sexual behavior while on duty or in uniform (e.g. masturbation, viewing 

and/or distributing pornographic images, sexting, whether by personal or 
Department phone or computer); 

5.  Voyeuristic actions that are sexually motivated (e.g. looking in windows of 
residences for sexually motivated reasons, traffic stops to better view 
occupants for non-professional reasons ) 

6.  Sexual harassment of colleagues or co-workers. 

 
Sexual Favor:  Any sexual act occurring in exchange for privileged treatment, 
salary enhancement, career advancement, or for taking or not taking law 
enforcement action. 
 
Sexting: Sending a text message or image by means of any electronic device 
alluding to activities of a sexual nature. 
 
Workplace:  Any property owned, leased, or otherwise designated for use by the 
municipality, including vehicles, training sites, substations, lodging obtained as a 
result of official travel, or any other location an on-duty employee is present or 
might be present. 
 
 

PROCEDURE

immediately notify the chain of command and Internal Affairs. 

 
B. Prohibited Actions.

result in    disciplinary action up to and including termination. 

2.  Anyone in a supervisory capacity or position of authority shall not engage

not extort, encourage, offer, accept, or engage in sexual favors. 
4.  Employees will not engage in any on-duty activity of a sexual nature.

C. Supervisor Responsibilities. Supervisors are in a unique position to detect 
warning signs and patterns that may indicate sexual misconduct by their 
subordinates. As such, they must act immediately to address the behavior in 
question. Supervisors should be aware of and take precautions to avoid 
opportunities for misconduct to occur. Upon receipt of a complaint, including 
those that are anonymous or from third parties, or when an employee 
demonstrates signs and patterns that may indicate sexual misconduct,

of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline.

person to escape the penalty of law with the full responsibility for the acts, or, 
with the direct or indirect benefit of the defendant, seek to obtain the continuance 
of trial, a dismissal of a case, or leniency for the defendant in any court except

damage to property through abuse or negligence may subject the employee 
responsible to reimbursement charges and/or disciplinary action.

returned on the day the termination is effective. 

IV. Employees shall not purchase, convert to their own use, or have any claim to

III. Conflict of orders:  Employees shall promptly obey any lawful order of a 
supervisor, including any order relayed on behalf of a supervisor by an employee 
of the same or lesser rank.  If an employee receives two apparently lawful but 
different orders that may conflict, the last order given shall be followed unless the 
order is retracted or modified.  If an employee receives conflicting orders, the 
employee shall inform the person giving the last order of the conflict.  The person 
giving the conflicting order shall then resolve the conflict by either retracting, 
modifying, or requesting the employee to comply with the latest order.  If the 
conflicting order is not altered or retracted, the employee may be held 
responsible for disobedience of the order or directive previously issued. 

IV. Obedience to orders:  No employee of the department is required to obey any 
order or law which is contrary to this manual; however, a refusal to obey is the 
responsibility of the employee and he or she shall be required to justify the 
action. 

V. Employees shall be responsible for understanding their assignment.  
Employees in doubt as to the nature or details of their assignment shall seek 
clarification from within their chain of command. 

VI. Employees shall make reasonable and diligent effort to remain informed of all 
information pertinent to their assignment.

I. Employees shall not interfere unnecessarily with the lawful business of any 
person or firm. 

II. Employees shall cooperate with other law enforcement agencies and assist 
with the investigation if needed.  Department procedures will define what 
information and/or assistance may be provided to other non-law enforcement 
agencies. 

1.03.005G  Duty Communications, Reports and Notices  

I. Employees shall respond to phone messages and e-mails from Department

Command when an interview in the performance of official duties is anticipated, 
or has been conducted with a Municipal Department Head or Head of another 
government agency. 

VIII. Employees shall inform superiors of any matter coming to their attention 
which may affect the welfare or have a direct effect on the Department or 
Department employees.  

1.03.005H Court Duties and Obligations  

I. Employees who are notified of a demand for their attendance in any trial or 
court-related hearing will be available or will be present at the time and place 
specified, and will be prepared to testify or assist as required.  Notification by a 
court is accomplished by any official document issued by an authorized person or 
verbal order either in person or by phone. 

II. If an employee is going to be on unscheduled leave of any kind, including sick 
leave, and they have been subpoenaed to appear in any court, including traffic 
court, the employee shall notify the appropriate agency (Federal, State or 
Municipal Prosecutor or the Traffic Court) if they are unable to make their court 
appearance.  It is the employee‘s responsibility to resolve all court conflicts 
involving leave that is ―last minute‖ or unscheduled.  As a last resort, if an 
employee is unable to make personal contact with the appropriate agency, that 
employee shall contact the Court Liaison. 

III. Most notices of court proceedings refer employees to a telephone number for 
further information.  Failure to call as instructed, or failure to expend reasonable 
efforts to comply with the intent of the order will be treated as disregard of the 
order. 

IV. Employees required to be in court shall remain until excused by the 
prosecuting attorney and/or judge/magistrate.  It shall be the employees' 
responsibility at the completion of testimony to ask the presiding official or the 
prosecutor of the proceeding whether or not they may be dismissed.  If the 
presiding official or the prosecutor dismisses the employee, the court appearance 
and the court obligation shall end at that time.  

1.03.005I  Identification  

I. Employees while on official business shall upon request immediately identify 
themselves by giving their name, rank, and DSN, and by displaying their badge 
or official credentials unless such action is likely to jeopardize successful 
completion of a police assignment.  This information will be produced in a 
professional and courteous manner. 

II. Employees not in uniform shall wear their issued Department badges

requirements of their assignment. 

1.03.005K  Miscellaneous Duty Considerations

Department procedure.  Under no circumstances will an employee who has not 
been specifically trained as a dog handler use a dog to accomplish a police task.  
Additionally, employees shall not bring personal pets to their work environment 
as this helps to ensure the safety of Police Service Dogs. 

II. Use of Departmental telephones for personal business is discouraged and 
shall be limited.  Employees will not incur an expense to the Municipality for a 
personal telephone call, nor use another's DSN, nor use an intentionally false 
account number to avoid payment of telephone charges. 

III. Employees shall not use another employee's badge or official police 
credentials without the permission of a superior officer, nor shall they knowingly 
permit any person not appointed to this Department to use an Anchorage Police 
Department badge, credential, uniform or part thereof at any time.

of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a

1.04.000  Special Policies 

1.04.005  Unbiased Policing 

PURPOSE 

This policy is intended to reaffirm the commitment of the Anchorage Police 
Department to unbiased policing, to clarify the circumstances in which officers 
can consider race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, economic status or age 
when making law enforcement decisions, and to reinforce procedures that serve 
to assure the public that we are providing service and enforcing laws in an 
equitable way.  In order to be effective we must be trusted and deal with both the 
reality of the difficult and complex job of policing and the perception of police 
action. 

POLICY 

Investigative detentions, traffic stops, arrests, searches, and property seizures by 
officers constitute a large portion of our mandated tasks.  These acts must 
always be based upon a standard of reasonable suspicion or probable cause. 
Officers must be able to articulate facts and circumstances that support 
reasonable suspicion or probable cause for investigative detentions, traffic stops, 
arrests, searches, and property seizures.  

Officers may take into account the reported race, ethnicity, gender, sexual 
orientation, economic status, or age of a specific suspect or suspects based on 
information that appears credible and locally relevant and links a person or 
persons to a particular incident, that would give the officer reasonable suspicion 
or probable cause to contact the person or persons. 

Law enforcement decisions will be based on the totality of circumstances and not 
solely based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, economic status or 
age.  Officers are routinely alerted to a variety of suspicious circumstances and 
although they may not be witnessing a recognizable crime, they still have the 
authority and obligation to investigate those circumstances and conduct a field 
interview. 

DEFINITIONS 

Bias-based policing:  Stopping, detention, interdiction or other enforcement 
action based solely on a person‘s race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, 
economic status or age. 
Probable Cause:  Reliable information in sufficient quantity and detail that would 
lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been committed or was 
attempted and that the suspect committed the crime. 

Reasonable Suspicion:  Articulable, objective facts which lead an officer to 
suspect that a person stopped has committed, is committing, or may be about to 
commit a crime. A well-founded suspicion is based on the totality of the 
circumstances and does not exist unless it can be articulated.  Reasonable 
suspicion supports a stop of a citizen.  Courts require that stops based on 
reasonable suspicion be "objectively reasonable."

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

1.04.010  Chain of Command 

The purpose of the policy is to define and clarify the policy and procedure 
regarding the concept and implementation of a Chain of Command philosophy as 
it pertains to the Anchorage Police Department, its Supervisors, and its 
employees. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

All sworn and non sworn employees, including those in Supervisory roles, must 
meet and comply with the requirements of this procedure.  Employees of the 
Anchorage Police Department are required to follow their established Chain of 
Command in matters of Official Department business.  Failure to do so may 
result in disciplinary action. 

DISCUSSION 

The relationship between Supervisors and subordinates must be one which 
allows and encourages open, flexible, respectful and effective communication.  It 
is essential that a Supervisor and subordinates interact in a positive and 
professional manner.  This provides the best means of developing ideas, 
exploring suggestions, or resolving personal conflicts and problems.  Although 
contract, policy, or law governs certain aspects of the relationship, most 
interactions concern communications that are matters of day to day business. 

The Anchorage Police Department philosophy allows for some flexibility in the 
chain as is pertains to Non-Official business matters.  Employees are 
encouraged to discuss Non-Official issues with their respective Supervisors as 
well as others within the Anchorage Police Department; however, they should 
follow their established Chain of Command when addressing Official 
departmental business.  Likewise, Commanders and Supervisors must also 
utilize the Chain of Command for Official business matters.  Additionally, 
Commanders and Supervisors must not allow an employee to abuse the "open 

door" policy of the Department and must direct the employee to his immediate 
Supervisor for the prompt resolution of Official requests or problems. 

DEFINITIONS 

Chain of Command:  Chain of Command is defined as the lines of 
communication, responsibility, and authority going upward and downward within 
the organizational hierarchy through each successive level of supervision.  In 
applying this definition, an employee must direct/receive Official 
Communication(s) through his or her Supervisor(s).  Each person within the 
Chain of Command has the inherent responsibility and authority to make 
decisions and provide solutions for those under their supervision.  

Official Communications:  Official Communication is the flow or exchange of 
information (oral, written or electronic) between Department personnel that 
directs operations designed to achieve the mission of the Anchorage Police 
Department.  Official Communications occurs between members of the 
Department, who are at the time that the communication is made, under the 
Color of Authority or who are acting in an official capacity for the Anchorage 
Police Department.  Official Communications includes, but is not limited to, 
communications about operations, personnel issues, resource expenditures, 
complaints, directives, notifications, as well as general and direct orders.  

Non-Official Communications:  Non-Official Communication is any information 
flow or exchange that is not at the time an Official Communication and is 
considered to be of informational value only to the members concerned.  Non-
Official Communications do not seek to specifically direct the operations of the 
Anchorage Police Department.  Non-Official Communications includes, but is not 
limited to research, notices, inquiries, or other items of informational distribution.  

Open Door Policy:  The Chief of Police wants employees to communicate to him 
or to any Supervisor ways to better perform the mission of the Anchorage Police 
Department.  The Chief of Police also allows for employees, who have made a 
good faith effort to resolve an Official or personal issue through their Chain of 
Command, to make an appointment to see him and voice their issues, 
complaints, suggestions.  

Direct Order:  A Direct Order is a command (oral, written or electronic) which 
mandates or prohibits a course of action or a specific conduct.  

Members:  All sworn and non-sworn employees of the Anchorage Police 
Department.  

General Order:  A General Order is usually presented by the Chief of Police, or 
from his or her agent, which mandates or prohibits a course of action or a 
specific conduct.  A General Order is usually in a written or electronic form, 
however if time sensitive or in an emergency situation it may be oral in form.  

1.04.010A  Chain of Command  

I. The Chain of Command descends from the Chief of Police and ascends from 
the lowest rank.  The Chain of Command shall be strictly adhered to in all Official 
Communications.  

II. Members of the Anchorage Police Department shall not by-pass their 
Supervisor or an Acting Supervisor for Official Communications except as set 
forth in these Policy and Procedures.  

III. Each member within the Chain of Command is responsible for the prompt and 
appropriate resolution of minor problems at the lowest level of authority.  

1.04.010B  Lawful Orders 

I. Members of the Police Department shall normally be required to take direct 
orders from, and be directly responsible to, one Supervisor, or Acting Supervisor, 
within their normally assigned duty area.  

II. Additionally, Members of the Police Department may be obligated to receive 
direct orders from divisional Commanders or other Supervisors during field 
operations or during emergency situations.  

1.04.010C  Unlawful Orders  

I. No sworn or non-sworn employee shall be expected to obey an unlawful order 
from any Commander or Supervisor inside or outside of their Chain of Command.  

II. See also Anchorage Police Department Regulations and Procedures Manual - 
Duty Requirements: ORDERS-UNDERSTANDING AND COMPLIANCE  

1.04.010D  Requests, Complaints, Suggestions, or other Reports  

I. It is the responsibility of every member of the Anchorage Police Department 
(Supervisors and subordinates) to disclose, discuss, and resolve matters of 
mutual concern.  An open dialogue will usually serve to develop an appropriate 
relationship.  There is an expectation that issues can be best resolved by those 
involved at the immediate level within the Chain of Command.  

II. Every member of the Police Department shall direct all Official 
Communications, including but not limited to, requests, complaints, reports, or 
suggestions to their immediate Supervisor, or Acting Supervisor, orally or in 
writing through their appropriate Chain of Command.  

III. If a solution cannot be reached collaboratively between the Supervisor and 
the employee, the matter may be addressed at the next higher level of 
supervision with the knowledge of the Supervisor. 

A. Issues taken to the next level of supervision will be done so collectively 
and with the knowledge and with the approval of each Supervisor or 
Commander within the employee‘s chain of command.  Matters will be 
addressed expeditiously; however, the issue may require further inquiry or 

consideration before a determination can be made.  The disposition of such 
issues will be communicated to all involved. 

B. Should the issue need to be brought to the next level within the Chain of 
Command, the employee is to inform their Supervisor or Commander either 
orally, written, or in electronic form at each progressive step within the chain.  
At each individual level every Supervisor or Commander is required to inquire 
about the issue and attempt to resolve it.  Should the issue not be resolvable 
then approval will be given to the employee to progress to the next higher 
level within the Chain of Command. 

C. After making a good faith effort to utilize the Chain of Command, the 
employee may be allowed to utilize the Chief‘s Open Door Policy by making 
the proper appointment through the Chief‘s Assistant and with the knowledge 
of the Chain of Command, including notifying the proper Deputy Chief of 
Police prior to initiating a meeting. 

1.04.010 E  Exceptions  

I. If a complaint is against the Officer's immediate Supervisor, the Officer may 
direct the initial communication to the Supervisor or Commander next higher in 
rank within the division. 

II. Any employee can at any time, with or without a Supervisor‘s knowledge or 
approval, direct Official Communication regarding criminal or serious misconduct, 
discrimination, or harassment to the Anchorage Police Department Internal 
Affairs Unit.  

1.04.010F  Directives from Other than the Direct Supervisor  

I. A Command Officer or a Supervisor shall retain command powers over all 
subordinates within the Department, but shall exercise such command powers 
over subordinates outside their usual Chain of Command only in situations where 
the police mission, police purpose or the reputation of the Department is 
jeopardized.  

II. Commanders or Supervisors finding it necessary to exercise their command 
powers with subordinates outside their usual Chain of Command, either to give 
orders or on-the-spot corrections, should at their earliest convenience report 
such action to the Commander or Supervisor in charge of the employee involved.  

1.04.010G  Emergency Situations 

Nothing in this procedure shall be interpreted to exempt any member of the 
Anchorage Police Department from taking appropriate action in the face of an 
emergency situation.  Any such occurrence requiring departure from an order, or 
any part thereof, shall be reported at once to the commanding officer on duty 
next in the Chain of Command.

2.01.000  Compensation & Benefits 

2.01.005  Compensation & Benefits- General 

To describe the underlying principles of the compensation and benefits 
system at the Anchorage Police Department, and to define those terms 
fundamental to subsequent procedures within this chapter. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

To provide an equitable and harmonious work environment by accurately and 
consistently abiding by Federal, State, Municipal, and contractual labor 
obligations, and by recognizing and implementing sound management 
practices. 

DUTY (SEE 1.01.000 DEFINITIONS) 

DEFINITIONS 

I. For purposes of this chapter, "duty" shall refer to the performance of 
services; the discharge of the legal and moral responsibilities of employment 
with the Anchorage Police Department.  It is the broadest term addressing the 
conduct of any authorized activities under color of authority.  Duty can 
include: 

A. Temporary Duty:  A temporary alteration of an employee's primary 
function within the Department.  This can include: 

1. Full Duty:  The ability of employees to work at full capacity in their 
regularly-scheduled job assignment, including overtime if required. 

2. Light Duty:  A type of temporary duty caused by a medical condition 
which prohibits employees from working at full capacity in the 
performance of their regularly-scheduled job assignment. 

3. Directed Assignment/Special Assignment. 

4. Job-related or other authorized activities.  The concept of "duty" 
goes beyond performance of what appears in one's job description. 
"Duty" can also include a variety of acts authorized by law, contract, 
rule, or convention, so these activities are not regarded as 
"exceptions."  This includes, but is not limited to, Departmental training, 
meal time, and various contractually-described activities. 

PRINCIPLES OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS 

I. Basic Premise.  Central to this entire chapter is recognizing that an 
agreement exists between any employer and its employees, wherein the 
employee provides specific skills (works) for a predetermined compensation 
(salary), and that this mutual obligation exists during established hours of 
employment.  Any departure from this--whether it is performance above this 
expectation (as overtime) or unique skills (specialty pay), or absence during 
the expected work period--is an exception which must be documented so as 
to adjust compensation and benefits. 

A. Exceptions.  These exceptions noted above fall into the two broad 
categories: 

1. Additional Compensation.  This is compensation above the base 
wage for work beyond the normal time periods, use of particularly 
specialized skills, or other conditions specified by law, rule, or contract; 
and 

2. Leave, or absence from duty.  Authorized absences from duty will 
always be in the form of some type of leave.  These types are 
identified and defined later in this procedure. 

B. Documenting Exceptions.  Since the basic premise is that an employee 
shall work a certain number of hours for a certain wage, any deviation 
from this must be documented.  The documents used by the Anchorage 
Police Department are: 

1. Leave Request forms, which document application for authorized 
absences from duty; and 

2. Additional Compensation Request forms, which apply for and 
document compensation beyond one's normal base salary. 

C. Methods of Compensation.  Represented employees usually have the 
choice of receiving additional compensation for overtime worked either in 
the form of wages or compensatory time (additional leave).  Other types of 
additional compensation must be given in the form of pay. 

II. Base Salary.  The basic hourly wage, described by "range" and "step" 
(within that range) from which all compensations are calculated.  The exact 
amounts vary by contract and law. 

A. Additional Compensation.  Certain things can add a percentage of 
one's base pay to his or her salary.  These situations are closely regulated 

by labor laws and contracts, so vary with time.  Of all the conditions which 
could result in additional compensation, the most common is overtime 
pay--the result of either call-in for duty, appearance for court on non-duty 
hours, and holdover beyond one's normal tour of duty. 

III. Authorized Absences from Duty. 

A. Leave-paid.  There are many events which require employees to be 
absent during the period they are presumed to be on duty.  The reason 
why a person is absent determines the type of leave involved.  Once the 
type of leave is established, priorities can be set, pay or "leave bank" can 
be adjusted and, in general, the absence can be administered.  The types 
of leave for which employees may be eligible include: 

B. Annual leave.  Time off for personal use or short-term illness/injury, 
accounted for by subtracting the amount of time absent from the 
employee's annual leave bank.  The employee accrues annual leave at a 
rate set by law and contract.  Annual leave may also be "cashed in" as 
pay. 

C. Compensatory leave.  Earned compensatory leave is identical to 
accrued annual leave, with the following exceptions: 

1. Such leave is subtracted from a separate compensatory leave bank; 
and  

2. Compensatory leave may not be converted to cash; and 

3. Unlike the annual leave bank that accrues at an established rate, 
use of the compensatory leave system is optional--employees can 
elect to be remunerated for overtime by adding leave time into their 
compensatory leave bank in lieu of reimbursement with money. 

Note:  That of all the ways of receiving additional pay, only overtime in 
its various forms may be converted into compensatory leave time.  All 
others are paid in salary form. 

4. Administrative Leave.  Time off initiated and granted only by 
appropriate authority within the administration of the Department.  
Administrative leave applies to those unusual circumstances wherein 
an employee should not be actively on duty, yet termination or other 
forms of leave are inappropriate.  Granting of administrative leave is 
precautionary in nature, and is not punitive.  All benefits continue to 
accrue while on administrative leave.  This leave is not subtracted from 
any leave bank. 

5. Training leave.  Time off for travel to, and attendance of, job-related 
training conducted outside of the geographic boundaries of the 
Municipality, and when such attendance requires overnight lodging.  If 
the attendance does not require overnight lodging, the employee's pay 
is unaffected, and is regarded as part of the employee's duty (no leave 
application is necessary).  Training leave is not subtracted from any 
leave bank. 

6. Jury leave.  Time off given to discharge one's responsibilities as a 
juror or prospective juror.  Jury leave time is not subtracted from any 
leave bank. 

7. Funeral leave.  Time off of duty to allow attending the funeral of an 
employee's immediate family.  Although the leave is not subtracted 
from any leave bank, the amount of time and circumstances of leave 
are governed by regulation and contract. 

8. Sick (medical) leave.  For represented employees, time off for 
reasons of: 

a) Protracted illness/injury.  Sick leave provisions apply only when 
the illness or injury is so great that the employee is absent from 
duty beyond a minimum period of time set by contract.  When that 
period is exhausted, that time and any further absence is 
subtracted from the employee's sick leave bank.  Absences for 
lesser illnesses and injuries are deducted from the employee's 
annual or, at the employee's option, compensatory leave bank. 
Employee's accrue sick leave at a rate set by contract; 

b) Worker's Compensation claims.  Most absences for medical 
conditions which are covered by Workers Compensation will not be 
deducted from any of the employee's leave banks. 

9. Military leave.  Military leave is granted to members of the National 
Guard or Military Reserves who have been ordered to attend a period 
of active duty.  Employees are entitled to two weeks per year of Military 
Leave.  Additionally, the Department may request the military to alter 
the dates of active duty to allow for proper staffing of the Department.  
For military duty beyond the period of military leave time, employees 
may use annual leave or leave without pay. 

10. Municipally-recognized holidays.  Law and contract govern which 
holidays are to be recognized, and how staffing, leave, and 
compensation are to be conducted.  However, in all cases, absence 
from duty for such holidays is not subtracted from any leave bank. 

D. Leave-unpaid.  There are certain provisions which result in a person 
being absent from duty, not receiving any compensation or accruing any 
benefits, but retaining employment.  This condition is known as "leave 
without pay," and has the two subcategories of: 

1. Punitive.  Punitive leave without pay is invoked by the administration 
as a sanction against misconduct. 

2. Non-punitive.  Non-punitive leave without pay is a response to 
employees' exigent personal circumstances.  Although the conditions 
vary with law and contract, the most common applications include: 

a) Extended vacation, when annual/compensatory leave is 
exhausted. 

b) Personal reasons, when annual/compensatory leave is 
exhausted. 

c). Temporary Illness, when annual, compensatory, and sick leave 
banks are exhausted, light duty status is inappropriate, but recovery 
to full duty status seems likely. 

d) Military duty that extends beyond Military Leave. 

e) Family leave, which is a form of unpaid leave that allows new 
parents time to bond with their children.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

2.01.010  Compensation & Benefits-Leave 

To advise all personnel of the authorized reasons for absences from duty, 
and instruct in the proper application for and processing of those requests. 

That all absences from duty be authorized, and that such absences be 
granted and documented according to sound management and accounting 
principles. 

Although there are many types of leave, they all result in absence from duty 
with possible impact on both the employee's compensation and the smooth 
operation of the Department.  Consequently, the granting of leave, or the 
involuntary imposition of leave on an employee, can be a serious matter. 

The procedure "Compensation & Benefits--General" (2.01.005) is dedicated 
to a full discussion and description of the terms critical to the procedures 
within this chapter.

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

DEFINITIONS 

REFERENCES 

Municipal Personnel Rules and existing labor contract(s) between the 
Municipality and the Anchorage Police Department Employees' Association 
are the primary reference documents to this chapter, including this procedure.  
State and Federal laws, particularly the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 
also play a significant role in determining employee benefits. 

I. ANNUAL AND COMPENSATORY LEAVE 

PROCEDURE 

A. General.  Annual leave and Compensatory leave are discussed 
together since they are nearly identical. T he few major differences are: 

1. Accrual.  All employees automatically accrue annual leave at a rate 
set by contract and ordinance.  Compensatory leave, however, is an 
optional program whereby worked overtime may be compensated by 
putting equivalent hours into a compensatory leave bank in lieu of 
receiving overtime salary. 

2. Cash-in.  Annual leave may be converted to cash (in accordance 
with current contract(s)), while compensatory leave can only be taken 
as leave from duty. 

B. Eligibility and Purpose.  There are two purposes of 
annual/compensatory leave.  One is to provide an employee with personal 
use time, while the other is for short term illness/injury.  Confusion can 
arise here, as annual/compensatory leave is routinely used as "sick 
leave," although there is a separate and distinct bank of leave called "sick 
leave."  This formal sick leave bank is used for longer term illness and/or 
injury.  Note the following: 

1. When used for personal reasons, annual, and, to a point, 
compensatory leave are granted as workload and staffing allows. 
When on such leave, there is minimal obligation on the employee to 
the department.  Leave is deducted from either the employee's annual 
leave bank or, if the employee has compensatory leave available and 
opts to use it, from his or her compensatory leave bank. 

2. When annual or compensatory leave is requested for short term 
illness or injury, it is regarded as a fairly high priority leave to grant 
even though it is usually requested on very short notice. Consequently, 
unpredictable staffing deficiencies can result, and lesser priority leaves 
can be denied.  Obviously, if this type of leave is abused, the 
consequences can be extreme to both the department and employees 
seeking approval for legitimate absences.  To reduce abuse, certain 
requirements can be made of employees using this form of leave.  
These include, but are not limited to: 

a). Showing verification of illness/injury; and/or  

b). Submitting to further medical examination. 

C. Accrual.  For annual leave, refer to the contract for the accrual rate.  
Compensatory leave accrues variably, depending on overtime hours 
worked, the rate of that overtime, and if the employee opts to be 
compensated by salary or compensatory leave time. 

D. Application.  When requesting annual leave, the following applies: 

1. The employee shall, depending on the nature of the use, either: 

a). Properly complete and submit a Leave Request form (see the 
Report Writing Manual for details) when requesting 
annual/compensatory leave for personal reasons.  That application 
will be processed according to the standards set in this procedure 
(I. E. 1. a, following). 

b). If Annual or Compensatory leave is to be used for a short term 
illness or injury, the employee shall comply with the provisions 
described in E. b. of this section. Once done, that absence will be 
deducted from the employee's annual or compensatory leave bank, 
according to that employee's choice. 

E. Processing procedure.  Once an employee requests annual or 
compensatory leave, the following process applies (See "B.1." for 
personal use, and "B.2." for illness or injury use): 

1. For personal use.  

a).The completed Leave Request is submitted to that employee's 
supervisor. On the applicant's request, the receiving supervisor 
shall initial and date a copy as receipt of that application. 

b).Standards for approval/denial.  When supervisors are given an 
application for leave, they become the primary approving/denying 
authority.  A denied application must be based on cause--and, to 
ensure fairness, the reasoning must be consistent.  Setting 
Department-wide standards is an initial step towards guaranteeing 
consistency, but police work is so vague and unpredictable in its 
staffing demands that rigid standards are hard to devise.  
Ultimately, it is the sound judgment and unprejudiced sense of 
fairness of a supervisor that ensures equity in personal leave 
allocation.  As an aid to the supervisor in evaluating an application 
of annual/compensatory leave for personal reasons, the following 
guidelines are offered: 

i. Review the form for completeness and accuracy. 

ii. Compare the application with any other pending applications, 
and assess for conflict with any contractual provisions, 
especially those regarding seniority priorities. 

iii. Attempt to determine the actual use of leave, and ensure the 
request is, in fact, for personal use and not eligible for a higher 
priority leave instead.  For instance, an employee might 
erroneously apply for annual leave to attend the funeral of an 
immediate family member, or to discharge jury obligations. 

iv. Weigh the anticipated staffing demands for the period in 
question.  This is perhaps the single most difficult area to 
assess, but by reviewing scheduled staffing for the day/period in 
question, other applications for leave, and statistics for required 
police services, a feel for sufficient staffing can be developed. 

c). Whenever an annual/compensatory leave request for personal 
use is denied, that application shall be kept in a "suspense" file with 
other denied applications within that unit/shift during that time 
period.  Should a previously approved leave be rescinded (either by 
the applicant or Department), and thus create a leave vacancy, 

denied applicants shall be contacted according to the chronological 
order (or, if seniority issues prevail, by descending seniority) of their 
leave request submissions, and given the opportunity to take all or 
part of the leave that was previously applied for but denied. 

d). In all cases, applicants for annual/compensatory leave shall be 
notified of the approval or denial as soon as practical.  As always, 
employees must confirm approval prior to taking leave. 

2. For illness/injury. 

a). Notification of absence for illness/injury shall be communicated 
by employees or their designee to their immediate supervisor.  If 
unable to contact the supervisor after exhausting all reasonable 
means, the following alternatives shall be exercised in the 
sequence shown below: 

i. Contact any member of the employee's immediate work unit.  
The person contacted shall relay the information to the absent 
employee's supervisor by: 

(1). Completing a Leave Request form and causing that form 
to be given to the absent employee's supervisor; or 

(2). Reflecting the information on plain paper, and causing 
that information to be given to the absent employee's 
supervisor; or 

(3). Contacting the absent employee's supervisor directly, 
and personally relaying the information to him/her. 

ii. Contacting Dispatch Center.  When so notified, the 
communications clerk taking the call shall relay the information 
to the absent employee's supervisor by: 

(1). Completing a Leave Request form and placing it in the 
affected unit's mailbox in Dispatch Center; or 

(2). Reflecting the information on plain paper, and placing it 
in the affected unit's mailbox in Dispatch Center; or 

(3). Communicating directly with the absent employee's 
supervisor. 

But, in any event; 

It is the responsibility of the supervisor to check the unit's mailbox in 
Dispatch Center and to ensure a Leave Request has been completed on 
the employee's behalf.  The communications clerk is not required to notify 
the supervisor of the absence, although he or she may do so as a 
courtesy. 

iii. Frequency of notification.  Normally, an employee will call in 
daily to notify of absence for minor illness or injury (as described 
just above). However, there are two occasions when daily 
notification is not required: 

(1). If the employee knows that the absence will span 
several work days, one notification for that entire period may 
be made.  The supervisor shall enter that period on the Bi-
Weekly Timesheet accordingly. 

(2). The second occasion would be any time a Physician's 
Report form is submitted.  That form acts as notification of 
absence for a specific period. 

Once notified, it is the absent employee's supervisor who is ultimately 
responsible for the entry of the absence into the Bi-Weekly Timesheet and 
the proper completion and submission of the Leave Request form. 

iv. The employee's supervisor shall review the leave request.  
This review allows an assessment of leave patterns or abuse, 
and alerts the supervisor that other provisions of the sick leave 
procedure may be invoked (most notably the requirement of a 
Physician's Report after 40 hours of absence). 

v. Standards for approval/denial.  Although true illness/injury 
absences are of the highest priority, requests for such absences 
can be denied.  Exigent circumstances may require the 
employee's attendance, or the illness/injury might be too minor 
to be eligible for annual/compensatory leave approval.  The 
supervisor reviewing the request takes such factors into 
account, and may seek verification of the illness/injury by 
personally visiting the employee. 

F. Obligations of Employees While on Annual/Compensatory Leave. 

1. Employees on annual or compensatory leave for personal use or 
short term illness/injury have the following minimum obligations: 

a). Abide by all applicable Department regulations of conduct (note 
especially those rules addressing "under color of authority"). 

b). Provide a location and method of contact when absent more 
than 40 hours, or when leaving the state. 

c). Abide by the provisions found in 3.06.010 E. regarding 
relinquishment/storage of Home Cars during extended absences. 

d). Make arrangements to return any Department equipment that 
might reasonably be needed by others during the absence. 

II. SICK LEAVE 

A Introduction.  This section pertains only to longer term absences due to 
illness or injury.  It is critical to note that the earlier section, ―I. 
ANNUAL/COMPENSATORY LEAVE"--addresses short-term illnesses and 
injuries, and use of annual or compensatory leave for those short 
absences. Consequently, the earlier Section ("I. ANNUAL AND 
COMPENSATORY LEAVE") and this section ("II.") of this procedure must 
be read together when resolving questions of employee absences due to 
sickness or injury. 

B. Eligibility and Purpose.  The purpose of the formal sick leave bank is to 
provide paid absences for employees who suffer longer term, catastrophic 
illness/injury.  Any employee who suffers such a bona fide medical 
condition is eligible to use any sick leave accrued in that leave bank.  
Such leave is granted solely by medical standards, and not by 
considerations of staffing, workload, or seniority. 

C. Accrual.  Employees accrue sick leave at a rate set by contract and 
ordinance.  Compensatory leave cannot be added to the formal sick leave 
bank. 

D. Application.  Absences from duty due to long-term illness or injury are 
deducted automatically by the Personnel Office when the standards 
specified in the labor contract are met.  The ill/injured employee has no 
application obligation. 

E. Processing Standards.  Sick leave is granted under the presumption 
that the condition warrants that absence, and such leave takes priority 
over all other forms of leave.  However, because such absences may 
cause severe and unpredictable staffing shortages, or can preempt other 
optional leaves, and since they are subject to abuse, the Department has 
authority to ensure that all standards pertaining to medical absences are 
met.  This includes, but is not limited to: 

1. Submitting a properly completed Physician's Report form on the next 
working day following a continuous 40 work-hour absence for 
illness/injury, or as required by the Department. 

a). The completed Physician Report forms shall be delivered to the 
Personnel Office of the Anchorage Police Department.  They can 
be submitted by anyone authorized by the affected employee, and 
can be delivered after hours.  Note these cautions, however: 

i. If delivered after hours, the person delivering the form cannot 
receive any receipt or confirmation. 

ii. The Physicians Report is the sole authorization for the 
absence.  Without the form, the employee risks receiving leave 
without pay for the subject period. 

b). Supervisors have an integral role in the entire sick leave 
process for employees under their authority.  This includes: 

i. Checking on the welfare of employees and participating in 
verification of the legitimacy and/or urgency of the claim of 
illness/injury.  Personal contacts with employees at 
reasonable, mutually acceptable times are expected.  The 
recommended frequency of these contacts is listed in "2. b" 
of this section. 

ii. Supervisors should make their services reasonably 
available to employees.  If no other arrangements can be 
made, supervisors are expected, at a minimum, to transport 

employees' Physician Report forms to the Personnel Office 
as described above. 

2. Completion of other applicable forms.  To maintain sick leave status, 
certain other forms must be completed.  These include: 

a) Authorization to Release Information.  This form, completed by 
the employee, authorizes the Department to contact the medical 
personnel involved in the employee's case. 

b) Supervisor's Contact Report.  This form is designed to document 
meetings and conversations with the employee during the period of 
absence.  The Personnel Office initiates the form by completing the 
top section and forwarding it to the employee's supervisor.  Each 
time there is contact with the ill/injured employee, the supervisor 
shall document that contact on this form, and forward a copy to the 
Personnel Office for filing.  The frequency of contact with the 
employee is suggested by the following guidelines: 

i. Weekly contact if the employee is absent due to: 

(1). Stress 

(2). Depression/Anxiety 

(3). Back problems 

(4). Broken rib(s) 

(5). Knee or shoulder injury 

(6). Dental surgery 

(7). Tendonitis  

(8). Bunions 

(9). Pinched nerve(s) 

(10). Abdominal or chest pain 

(11). Bronchitis/Asthma 

(12). Infections 

(13). Ulcers 

(1). Pregnancy 

(2). Pneumonia 

(3). Fractured limb(s) 

(4). Internal injuries 

(5). Gunshot wound 

(6). Minor surgery 

(1). Heart attack 

ii. Contact every two weeks if the employee is absent due to: 

iii. Contact every three weeks if the employee is absent due to:  

(2). Severe burns 

(3). Cancer 

(4). Major surgery 

(5). Stroke 

F. Obligations of Employees While on Sick Leave.  While on sick leave 
status, employees have the following minimum obligations: 

1. Abide by all applicable Department regulations of conduct (note 
especially those rules addressing "under color of authority.") 

2. Provide a location and method of contact during the absence. 

3. Absent reasonable medical cause, not travel outside the Municipality 
without prior approval from that employee's Division Commander.  
Note that: 

a). Permission to travel will not be unreasonably withheld; and 

b). Employees residing outside the Municipality are allowed the 
same travel authorization as Municipal residents. 

4. Abide by the provisions found in 3.06.010 E, regarding 
relinquishment/storage of Home Cars during extended absences. 

5. Make arrangements for the return of any special Department 
equipment that might reasonably be needed by others during the 
absence. 

6. Submit to municipally-sponsored medical examinations, as 
appropriate. 

7. Submit the forms described earlier in this section in a timely, 
complete, and accurate manner (most notably the Physician's Report 
form and the Authorization to Release Information form). 

8. Be reasonably available for visit(s) and/or telephone contact by a 
Department representative, most commonly the employee's 
supervisor. 

9. As the medical condition improves: 

a). Report for light duty, if required (see Light Duty, below). 

b). Submit a Return to Duty Authorization at the conclusion of the 
medical condition. 

III. ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE 

A. Introduction.  Administrative leave is a "miscellaneous" category of 
leave that provides the Department with a method of allowing absences 
on its own initiative for unusual circumstances. 

B. Eligibility and Purpose.  Administrative leave originates from and is 
granted by the city administration.  Most commonly, administrative leave is 
given to employees involved in potentially traumatic, on-the-job events. 
Administrative leave is never punitive. 

C. Accrual.  Administrative leave does not accrue into, nor is its use 
deducted from, any leave bank. 

D. Application.  Administrative leave is not applied for by any employee. 

E. Processing Standards.  The Chief of Police initiates administrative 
leave. 

F. Obligations of Employees While on Administrative Leave.  All 
obligations of employment while on leave continue, plus any specific, 
additional conditions. 

IV. TRAINING LEAVE 

A. Introduction.  Department employees are routinely exposed to two 
levels of training; the first is done in-house or locally, which is regarded as 
part of the person's assignment during that tour of duty.  This is not 
regarded as absent from duty, so "training leave" does not apply.  The 
second is attendance of job related training session(s) requiring true 
absence from duty, often longer term and always more distant, with 
overnight stays necessary.  Since this second type is regarded as absent 
from duty, there must be a time accounting.  This is accomplished by 
applying for and receiving "training leave."  This section discusses that 
procedure. 

1. Note this limitation: When training is sought, two levels of approval 
are necessary: 

a). First, employees must be eligible for, and receive permission to 
attend, the training in question.  This is normally done by following 
the instructions given on the training announcement; then, 

b). If selected for training, the leave to attend the training is 
requested.  Approval to attend a school is not automatic approval to 
be absent from duty.  This procedure only addresses the 
application for and processing of the training leave. 

B. Eligibility and Purpose.  Any employee may apply for training leave if 
attendance of a job-related schooling is desired by the employee or 
required by the Department, and permission to attend that training has 
been granted. 

C. Accrual.  Training leave is neither accrued into, nor deducted from any 
leave bank. 

D. Application.  Employees requesting training leave shall submit a 
properly completed Leave Request Form (see the Report Writing Manual 
for details).  For Department-required training, the employee's supervisor 
will cause the completion of the leave application on behalf of the 
employee. 

E. Processing Procedure.  The processing procedure for training leave is 
identical to the processing procedure for annual/compensatory leave for 
personal purposes. Section "I. E. 1." of this procedure should be 
consulted. 

F. Obligations of Employees While on Training Leave.  While on training 
leave, employees are required to satisfy all the requirements of an 
employee on annual/compensatory leave for personal use, but with the 
following additional obligations: 

1. Diligently attend the training sought. 

a). Retain receipts for reimbursement/per diem. 

G. Department-Sponsored Training.  Employees who desire to attend a 
class sponsored by the Department shall submit an application in the form 
and manner specified in the posting for that training.  Applicants shall be 
selected in a method prescribed by the Training Section, consistent with 
Department and municipal policy and procedures.  This method shall 
ensure that the curriculum of any course is of benefit to the Department, 
and that the expenditure is pre-approved. 

1. Selected individuals will be placed on temporary duty assignment 
(TDA) to Training.  The resulting administrative impact is as follows: 

a). Those employees will not be eligible for overtime call-in during 
the period of the school, but will still be responsible for satisfying all 
normal court obligations, and will be eligible to respond to 
emergency call-outs of specialized units of which they may be a 
member. 

b). Employees who are TDA shall assume a "five-eights" schedule, 
which includes a one-hour unpaid lunch and weekends off.  
Further, they shall comply with the Training Section directions for 
attire, and any other special instructions that might be necessary. 

c). Training leave shall be granted in lieu of working a regularly-
scheduled shift if there is less than seven hours between the end of 
one duty cycle and the beginning of another. 

d). For training that lasts up to six days, employees shall be paid 
the normal overtime premium for duty performed on what would 
normally have been a regularly-scheduled day off.  For schools of 
more than five days, employees shall be assigned to Saturdays and 
Sundays off for the duration of the training. 

H. Training Other than Department-Sponsored.  Employees who attend 
schools that are not sponsored by the Department are considered on TDA 
status for the period of that training, and during the associated travel time.  
There are no circumstances that would permit overtime salary associated 
with non-Department-sponsored training. 

V. JURY LEAVE 

A. Introduction.  Jury leave is an authorized absence allowing employees 
to satisfy their civic duties as jurors.  These duties can occur either: 

1. During the employee's normal tour of duty, in which case the 
employee shall attend jury duty in lieu of Department duty.  The exact 
terms and conditions can be found in the current labor contract. 

or  

2. Outside the employee's normal tour of duty.  When such attendance 
meets the standards specified in the current labor contract, the 
employee may not be expected to appear for some or all of a particular 
tour of duty.  The exact formula is discussed in the labor contract. 

Note:  In either case, it is expected that any absence from duty be 
documented by a completed Leave Request form (indicating "jury leave") 
and a verification of attendance completed by the court. 

B. Eligibility and Purpose.  Any employee who appears for jury duty as 
described in current labor contract is eligible for jury leave.  The purpose 
of such leave is to account for employee absences caused by discharging 
the duties of a juror.  This is distinct from any court activities that are 
job/case related. 

C. Accrual.  Jury leave is neither accrued into, nor deducted from, any 
leave bank. 

D. Application.  Jury duty requires close coordination between affected 
employees and their supervisor.  Employees must advise their supervisors 
of the jury obligations in advance, and keep their supervisors apprised of 
all changes and developments.  On concluding a period of jury duty, 
employees will properly complete and submit the Leave Request form, 
according to instructions in the Report Writing Manual. 

E. Processing Procedure.  When a Leave Request for jury duty is 
completed, the following process shall occur: 

1. Submit the request to the immediate supervisor.  Attach any 
verification of jury attendance given by Court personnel. 

2. That supervisor shall enter the absence on the Bi-Weekly 
Timesheet. 

F. Obligations of Employee While on Jury Leave. 

1. Abide by all applicable regulations of conduct for employees on 
leave.  This includes the wearing of appropriate civilian attire; and 

2. Submit any jury duty reimbursements to Payroll. 

VI.FUNERAL LEAVE 

A. Introduction.  Funeral leave authorizes absence from duty for any 
employee who has an immediate family member die.  The actual terms 
and conditions are specified in the current labor contract. 

B. Eligibility and Purpose.  Whenever a family member (as defined in the 
prevailing labor contract) dies, the affected employee may submit a Leave 
Request to seek authorization for a paid absence to attend to matters 
surrounding that loss.   

C. Accrual.  There is no "funeral leave bank" that accrues leave time, but 
all employees are entitled to paid leave to attend funeral activities based 
on the specific provisions of the current labor contract.   

D. Application.  When employees suffer the loss of an "immediate family 
member" (see the current labor contract for definition), they may apply for 
funeral leave on the Leave Request form, marking the block entitled 
"funeral leave." 

E. Processing Procedure.  Funeral leave is processed exactly as annual 
leave, except that it is given higher priority.  To review, the Leave Request 
form is completed and submitted to the supervisor, and that supervisor 
reviews the application and will either approve or deny it.  Because of the 
urgency of this type of leave, the supervisor shall process it promptly, and 
may deny applications for lesser priority leaves to accommodate the 
funeral leave request. 

1. Obligations of Employees While on Funeral Leave.  Employees who 
are granted funeral leave are expected to use the leave as it was 
intended--to attend to matters directly related to the death of a family 
member.  In addition, employees shall: 

a). Abide by all applicable Department regulations of conduct; and 

b). Provide a method of contact to the Department; and 

c). Make arrangements to return any special Department 
equipment that might reasonably be needed by others during the 
absence; and 

d). Provide verification of death and identity/relationship of 
deceased, if requested. 

A. Introduction.  The Federal and Municipal laws governing Military Leave 
are designed to allow employees to maintain a Reserve Military role 
without jeopardizing their careers or interrupting benefit accrual.  All 
Department employees are provided with 80 hours per year of leave time, 
compensated according to current labor contract, to satisfy associated 
military obligations.  This leave allowance benefits all parties, but operates 
best when the employee is sensitive to Department staffing needs by 
selecting military leave times when the absence will not unreasonably or 
excessively impair Department operations.  Consequently, eligible 
employees are encouraged to participate in military activities, but are also 
reminded of their responsibility to seek those leave times which would 
least impact the overall mission of the Department.  

B. Eligibility and Purpose.  Employees wishing to engage in Reserve 
military service, including training, may apply for military leave.  Military 
training is not eligible for Department training leave. 

C. Accrual.  Employees are entitled to 80 hours per year of military leave 
time. 

D. Application.  Application for military leave is made on the Leave 
Request form, marking "Military Leave" as the type of leave sought, and 
attaching a copy of the military orders requiring the absence. 

VI. MILITARY LEAVE 

E. Processing Procedure.   

1. The completed leave request with attached orders is submitted to 
the supervisor, who shall review and process the leave application.  If 
the period in question would result in significant staffing difficulties, the 
Department may contact the appropriate military authority to establish 
if an alternative time would be practical.  If so, the leave for the 
requested period can be denied, based on a substitute period that 
would satisfy both the military and Department needs. 

2. Should employee‘s desire leave for bona fide military purposes, but 
have previously exhausted the allocated 80 hours, they may submit an 
annual or compensatory leave request; or, if no leave remains in those 
leave banks, for leave without pay.  Processing of those requests shall 
be given the same priority as a military leave request, but the absence 
would be deducted from the employee's leave bank (or, in the case of 
leave without pay, the absence would be uncompensated). 

F. Obligations of Employees While on Military Leave.  Employees on 
military leave will be expected to diligently perform the military obligations 
justifying the leave.  In addition, employees shall: 

1. Abide by all applicable Department regulations of conduct; and 

2. Provide a method of contact to the Department; and 

3. Make arrangements to return any special Department equipment 
that might reasonably be needed by others during the absence; and 

4. Submit all military pay vouchers (received during the 80 hour Military 
Leave allowance only) to Payroll, if requested.  Military pay received 
while on Annual or Compensatory leave, or while on Leave Without 
Pay status, does not have to be turned over to the Municipality. 

VII. LEAVE WITHOUT PAY 

A. Introduction.  Leave without pay, like all other types of leaves, is an 
authorized absence from duty, but unlike the other forms of leave, this 
type of absence is without compensation, and may even suspend accrual 
of other benefits and/or impact employment status of the affected person.  
This section of the procedure will:  

1. Identify the different types of leave without pay; and 

2. Explain how employees get on "leave without pay" status. 

B. Eligibility and Purpose.  There are two broad categories of leave 
without pay: 

1. Punitive leave without pay, known more commonly as "suspension 
from duty without pay"; and 

2. Non-punitive leave without pay.  The different occasions for non-
punitive leave without pay include: 

a). Personal reasons.  Extraordinary circumstances may exist that 
would make it appropriate for employees to request leave from duty 
without compensation. 

b). Medical Reasons.  Employees might suffer off-duty illnesses or 
injuries that create absences for periods extending beyond their 
Annual, Compensatory, and Sick leave bank totals combined.  The 
current labor contract and Municipal Personnel Rules define the 
terms and conditions of using leave without pay to cover such 
periods.  These documents should be consulted for details on 
eligibility and other features. 

C. Accrual.  There is no leave bank for leave without pay.  However, the 
labor contract specifies the maximum period of time for different forms of 
non-punitive leave without pay. 

D. Application.  Punitive leave without pay is imposed on an employee, not 
requested.  Non-punitive leave without pay, however, may be applied for 
by employees, and is done so on the Leave Request form.  Employees 
shall also attach a letter to the Chief of Police detailing the reason(s) for 
the leave without pay request. 

E. Processing Procedure.  Requests for non-punitive leave without pay 
are submitted to the affected employees' supervisors, but normally 
considered by the Chief of Police or a designee.  Granting of leave without 
pay is usually done as a discretionary act by the Chief of Police (based on 
valid management principles), or may be governed by current labor 
contract provisions. 

F. Obligations of Employees While on Leave Without Pay.  Employees on 
non-punitive leave without pay are expected to use the leave for the 
purposes stated in the letter of explanation to the Chief of Police, and to 
abide by any special conditions set by the Department while on that leave.  
Employees on leave without pay for punitive reasons are expected to 
abide by conditions set by the Department.  All persons on any leave 
without pay shall: 

1. Abide by all applicable Department regulations of conduct; and 

2. Provide a method of contact to the Department; and 

3. Make arrangements to return any special Department equipment 
that might reasonably be needed by others during the absence. 

G. FAMILY LEAVE 

1. Introduction.  Family leave is a form of absence governed by 
Federal and State law.  The premise of those laws is that parents 
should be allowed time to bond with their children without jeopardizing 
their employment. 

2. Eligibility and Purpose.  Employees about to become parents, 
whether by birth or adoption, should contact the Personnel office for 
the latest information regarding eligibility. 

3. Accrual.  There is no family leave bank.  Existing leave banks (with 
certain exceptions) are used first, then leave without pay is made 
available to employees who wish to take advantage of the entire period 
of time allowed by law, but who have insufficient leave banks to cover 
that period. 

4. Application.  The Personnel office should be contacted as soon as 
practical, either by telephone or by memorandum, advising the 
Department of the possible absence.  That employee, in turn, will 
provide the appropriate leave application form(s) to comply with the 
law and accounting for the time period sought. 

5. Processing Procedure.  The Department will process the application 
in compliance with existing law. 

6. Obligations of Employees While on Family Leave.  Employees 
granted leave under the provisions of the Family Leave laws are 
expected to spend that time with their family, as the law intends.  Since 
this absence can last several months, it is given high priority and can 
involve two absences (for instance, when both parents are Department 
employees), it becomes very critical to satisfy the spirit of the law.  
Absences from the family during this period would be considered an 
abuse of family leave.  In addition, employees shall: 

a). Abide by all applicable Department regulations of conduct; and 

b). Provide a method of contact to the Department; and 

c). Make arrangements to return any special Department 
equipment that might be reasonably needed by others during the 
absence; and 

d). Provide verification of birth or adoption, if requested. 

Employees have an underlying responsibility to ensure that they have 
properly applied for and received approval for all absences.

F. Security.  It shall be the responsibility of every employee assigned a 
computer or who shares a computer to ensure its security as well as the 
information stored on it whenever they are logged on to that computer or it is 
otherwise under their control.  Every precaution must be taken to prevent its 
theft or unauthorized use.  Therefore, employees shall, at a minimum:  

1. Log off the Records Management System, e-mail, and NCIC when the 
computer is left unattended 

2. Lock office doors when appropriate 

3. Lock vehicle doors or secure laptop/palm computers in the trunk when 
the vehicle is unattended (If weather is a consideration, laptop/palm 
computers should be secured in the assigned employee's residence while 
off duty or out of service) 

4. Notify the (IS) manager if Department computers or peripheral 
equipment are damaged or stolen, or if it appears unauthorized access 
was attempted or gained. 

G. Maintenance and Repairs.  Information Systems is responsible for all 
maintenance, support and repair of Department computers.  Requests for 
service, unless critical, should be routed through the supervisor of the 
affected component.  The assigned (IS) support personnel will evaluate and 
prioritize requests and reply to the supervisor.  All requests must include the 
following information:

H. Inspections.  Department computers are subject to inspection by 
component supervisors or (IS) personnel at any time. 

1. Should a component supervisor, through an inspection, find a violation 
of regulations or procedures on a computer assigned to an employee, that 
supervisor may be required to provide the IS manager with a written 
report. 

2. Whenever an upgrade or maintenance is performed on a Department 
computer, the appropriate (IS) employee shall complete an inspection 
report. 

I. Training.  Certain equipment, applications or programs may require initial or 
recurrent training for proficiency and/or certification.  Employees should 
request this training through the chain of command as with any other training.  
In any case, 

1. It is the responsibility of each assigned employee to maintain National 
Crime Information Center (NCIC) certification if required by the employee's 
supervisor or job assignment; and 

2. It is the responsibility of the Anchorage Police Training Academy with 
the assistance of (IS) personnel, to design and administer additional 
computer training specific to the software available to assigned 
employees, except for training provided by a private company approved 
by the Chief of Police.   

IV. ELECTRONIC MAIL (E-MAIL) PROCEDURES 

A. General.  The Municipal e-mail system is a formalized communication tool 
that shall be used for official business only.  Employees are reminded that e-
mail is not a protected form of communication and could be subject to a 
discovery motion in a criminal or civil case, or constitute grounds for an 
internal investigation.  The following procedures shall apply to all employees: 

1. All employees shall check their e-mail account each business day and 
reply to messages that require an answer in a timely manner. 

2. Employees shall disclose all passwords and codes necessary to access 
their personal e-mail account to a supervisor in their chain of command 
upon request. 

3. Employees shall not attempt to gain access to another's mailbox, 
except that a supervisor in an employee's chain of command may conduct 
an inspection of an employee's account for official business purposes 
only. 

4. All e-mail messages shall be composed in a respectful and professional 
manner.  Employees should remain aware of the potential for widespread 
distribution of any e-mail message, and of the consequences for violation 
of Departmental regulations. 

5. Any employee who receives e-mail containing a suspicious enclosure or 
file from an unknown source should contact (IS) personnel before opening 
the file. 

6. Upon termination, an employee's immediate supervisor shall notify the 
(IS) manager so that the user's account can be removed from the system. 

7. Employees are discouraged from sending e-mails with large or 
numerous electronic file attachments. 

8. Information Systems can maintain only a limited number of global e-
mail groups.  Therefore, the following criteria shall be met before a global 
group is approved: 

a). Each group must consist of at least ten members. 

b). The group must be intended for use by at least ten employees or 
others. 

c). Changes to the member list should not be required on a regular 
basis. 

d). The group is necessary for use by an outside agency (Prosecutor, 
etc.). 

9. Exceptions to the above have been authorized by the (IS) manager. 

a). Personal e-mail groups initiated and maintained by users are 
encouraged. 

b). Employees are encouraged to empty their deleted items folder on a 
regular basis to conserve network resources.  The e-mail server will 
purge the DELETED e-mails after 30 days. 

c). Outgoing e-mail messages are limited in size to 40Mb to Municipal 
recipients and 20Mb to non-Municipal recipients.  Mailboxes kept on 
the e-mail server are to be limited in size to 300Mb.  Once that limit is 
reached, employees will only be able to read and receive e-mail but 
not be able to send e-mail. 

d). Command-level approval must be obtained before sending e-mail 
to the ―All Personnel‖ and ―All Sworn‖ e-mail groups.  Command-level 
here is defined as a Lieutenant and above or a non-sworn UNIT 
supervisor. 

IV. INTERNET ACCESS AND USE 

A. General.  The Internet is a tool for research and communication.  As such, 
certain employees have been granted access for business use only.  
Employees who abuse Internet access privileges may be subject to 
disciplinary action. 

B. Requests for Access.  Unless blanket access has been granted to a 
component, individual employees must request Internet service on an 
assigned computer through their immediate supervisor, who shall forwarded 
the necessary documents through the chain of command.  All requests must 
be approved by the Chief of Police. 

C. Use of the Internet.  Employees who have been granted Internet access 
privileges shall be subject to the following regulations: 

1. Employees shall log off the Internet unless actively seeking information. 

2. Employees shall not access any web site unrelated to job duties 

3. Employees shall not download information or data for personal use. 

4. Internet pages or web sites shall not be linked to the APD home page 
unless first approved by the (IS) manager.

2.02.010  Department Communications-Request for Action System 

To advise all personnel of the proper use of and response to the ‗Request For 
Action‘ (RFA) system used at the Anchorage Police Department. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

That the Department maintains a vigorous quality control program, to include:  
the aggressive monitoring of employees' work product for safety, accuracy, 
legibility, and timeliness; requiring prompt corrections to any deficiencies; and 
hold employees accountable for failing to take proper action. 

The goal of the Request for Action system is to: 

DISCUSSION 

Provide designated personnel charged with reviewing other employee‘s final 
work product with a means by which they can quickly and reliably notify 
another employee of action they must take in a specific matter, and 
simultaneously document and track that request. 

Provide a progressive system to ensure compliance with that request.  The 
first notice is sent to the employee directly; the second notice is sent through 
that employee's supervisor; the third and final notice is sent to the appropriate 
Division Commander.

Corrective action.  Supplemental work needed to bring a particular work product 
to an acceptable level of quality. 

Notice.  First, second, and third "notice" identify the number of times an individual 
request is made of a particular employee. 

I. Supervisors or their designees will initiate a Request for Action when a 
corrective action is needed. 

PROCEDURE 

A. The first RFA shall be addressed to the responsible employee.  On the first 
request, only the top portion of the RFA will be addressed to the employee 
and the subsequent explanatory data (case number, date of request, type of 
problem, requestor) will be completed.  The response due date will be noted 
on this first request.  An employee will respond to a Request for Action within 
two weeks of receiving the request, unless exigent circumstances exist. 

B. If the due date should lapse without a response from the employee, a 
second notice will be generated by the requestor.  The second notice will be 
addressed to the employee‘s Supervisor and it will become that Supervisor‘s 
responsibility to personally contact the employee to assure the problem is 
corrected.  A response due date will be noted on this second request.  An 
employee will respond to a Request for Action within two weeks of receiving 
the request, unless exigent circumstances exist. 

C. The third and final RFA will be addressed to the employee‘s Division 
Commander when the second due date lapses without a response in a timely 
manner from either the employee or their supervisor.  

D. Supervisors and commanders may take appropriate action, to include 
discipline, to facilitate the correction of any time sensitive RFA themselves or 
by delegating another employee, whenever the responsible employee is 
unavailable. 

II. Tracking Requests for Action.  All Requests for Action will be tracked by the 
unit or section that requested the action.

2.04.005  Internal Investigations 

This  policy  is  for  internal  use  only  and  does  not  enlarge  an  employee‘s  civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of  care,  in  an  evidentiary  sense,  with  respect  to  third  party  civil  claims  against

The purpose of this policy is to inform all employees of procedures for accepting, 
processing, and investigating complaints. 

Events involving employees of the Anchorage Police Department that could 
result in disciplinary or corrective action will be investigated fairly and impartially.  
Any action taken by the Department at the conclusion of an investigation should 
be consistent with good management practices and fundamental fairness. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

The establishment of procedures for investigating complaints and allegations of 
employee misconduct is important to demonstrate and protect the integrity of the 
Department and promote the public trust.  Because of the nature of police work, it 
is inevitable that the Department will receive complaints about actions or the 
inaction of employees.  The Department shall conduct its investigations in a 
timely manner, to find and correct improper conduct.  The Department shall also 
accept and document reports of good employee conduct. 

The Department will accept complaints originating from any source, including 
other employees.  Employees should direct all complaints against the 
Department or other employees to a supervisor or Internal Affairs for processing.  
The individual investigating a complaint will endeavor to electronically record all 

  

complaints; all complaints must be documented on a Complaint Form or entered 
into IA Pro via Blue Team.  Questions, as opposed to complaints, should be 
handled immediately and do not require documentation. 

Not all sustained complaints will result in disciplinary action.  Procedural 
violations or first time sustained cases of discourtesy, rudeness, or poor service 
response can be handled by corrective actions such as counseling. 

DEFINITIONS 

Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA):  Refers to the current contract in effect 
between the Municipality of Anchorage and the Anchorage Police Department 
Employees Association (APDEA). 

Complaint Form:  The Commendation, Suggestion and Complaint Form (APD 
Form 51-022, hereby referred to simply as Complaint Form) shall be used to 
record all complaints against Department personnel or policies, whether from 
citizens or members of the Department.  Each completed Complaint Form shall 
be submitted to Internal Affairs to have an IA Pro case number assigned so 
processing of complaints may be monitored.  The Complaint form can be found 
on the Intranet under Forms. 

Complaint Disposition Notification Form:  Sent to complainant at conclusion of 
the investigation.  Copy attached to Blue Team entry.  Found on the Intranet 
under Forms. 

External Complaint:  Any complaint received from someone outside of the 
Department. 

Findings:  Findings are the results of the investigation.  There are four possible 
findings:   

Sustained:  The investigation disclosed sufficient evidence to prove that the 
incident did occur and that the individual named in the complaint was 
responsible and was culpable. 

Not Sustained:  The investigation failed to disclose enough evidence to 
clearly prove or disprove the allegation or the complainant failed to cooperate 
with the investigation and it was closed. 

Exonerated:  This finding states the act that provided the basis for the 
complaint or allegation occurred; however, the investigation revealed that the 
act was justified, lawful, proper, and that no misconduct was involved. 

Unfounded:  The investigation conclusively proved that the incident did not 
occur, or that the employee named in the complaint was not involved. 

Intake Supervisor:  The first supervisor who deals with a complaint typically 
makes a Blue Team Entry or fills out a Complaint Form; however, it may not be 
the same Supervisor who eventually conducts the investigation. 

Internal Complaint Tracking System (ICTS): The current system in use by the 
Department for the documentation and tracking of all complaints against the 
Department or individual officers and internal investigations. 

  

Investigating Supervisor: The supervisor who investigates the complaint. 

Investigations:  There are two general types of investigations: 

1. Criminal: One in which there is an allegation of a violation of the law. 

2. Non-Criminal: Involves an allegation of a violation of a policy, procedure, or 
training standard. 

Question:  An issue raised by a citizen that does not involve a policy or 
procedural violation and merely requires an explanation of events or actions. 

Violation:  A sustained complaint of an act or omission contrary to any regulation, 
policy, or procedure.  A violation can subject the employee to any disciplinary or 
corrective action identified in this procedure. 

I.  ACCEPTING AND FILING COMPLAINTS 

PROCEDURE 

A.  Manner of Documenting Complaints:  All external complaints will be 
documented either by completing a Complaint form or in Blue Team. 
Employees shall direct all complaints against the Department or other 
employees to a supervisor or Internal Affairs for processing.  
Complaints shall be accepted directly from the complainant in person, 
by telephone, in writing, or by any other means.  Anonymous 
complaints shall also be accepted.  

1.  Supervisors within the Department shall accept and document 

complaints using the Complaint Form or by making an entry into 
Blue Team. 

2. 

If practical, the Department‘s complaint procedures should be 
explained to the complainant. 

B.  Receiving Complaints:  Complaints may be received in a variety of 

formats: 

1.  Letter Complaints:  Letters alleging misconduct by a Department 
employee shall be forwarded to the Internal Affairs Unit.  Internal 
Affairs will use the letter as the source document and assign an IA 
Pro case number to the complaint. 

2.  Complaint Forms:  APD Complaint Forms will be placed at the 
front counter of APD and other municipal offices.  When a 
complaint form is received in this manner, it will initially be routed 
to Internal Affairs. After an IA Pro case number has been assigned, 
an assessment will be made to ascertain at what level in the 
organization the complaint will be investigated. 

3.  Telephone Complaints:  Complainants contacting the Department 
by telephone shall be transferred immediately to a supervisor, if 
available, who will obtain as much information as possible from the 

 

  

complainant and complete a Complaint Form or make a Blue 
Team entry. 

a. Dispatch supervisors who receive telephone complaints 
shall send a CAD message to the supervisor of the 
employee involved, if available, and follow up with an email 
message, both of which should contain the nature of the 
complaint, the complainant information, and the officer‘s 
name or vehicle number. The email message must also be 
sent to the supervisor‘s commander and Internal Affairs. 

4. 

Internet Complaints:  Citizens may submit a complaint directly to 
Internal Affairs by accessing the APD webpage. Complaints 
received in this manner will be assigned an IA Pro Case number 
for tracking.  Internal Affairs will access the complaint to determine 
at what level the complaint should be investigated. 

5.  Departmental Complaints:  Whenever a member of the 

Department desires to initiate a complaint against another 
member, the following protocol will apply:  Complaints by superior 
officers against subordinates shall be documented directly into IA 
Pro or Blue Team. If a subordinate officer wishes to file a complaint 
against a superior officer, the subordinate shall complete a 
Complaint Form and submit it to Internal Affairs. 

6.  Governmental Agencies:  When information is received from 

governmental agencies alleging specific acts of misconduct by a 
Department employee, the information shall be forwarded to the 
Internal Affairs Unit. 

7.  Policy Complaints:  Complaints concerning Departmental policy, 
performance, or practice, and not alleging misconduct by specific 
employees, known or unknown, shall be recorded on a complaint 
form or entered into Blue Team. 

8.  Completed Complaint Forms:  The completed complaint form 

should contain a detailed description of the alleged act(s) of 
misconduct, including date, time, place, names or descriptions of 
Department employees involved in the incident; names and 
addresses of witnesses if known; and any other relevant 
information.   

9.  Signing of the Complaint Form:  If the complaint is made in person, 
the complainant shall read it after completion by the supervisor and 
make any necessary corrections. The supervisor shall then request 
the complainant sign the form. Should the complainant refuse to 
sign, a notation to that effect shall be made on the form. In all other 
respects unsigned complaints shall be processed in the same 
manner as signed complaints. 

  

10. 

Immediate Resolution of Complaints:  Complaints resolved to the 
complainant‘s satisfaction at the time of the complaint shall be 
recorded in Blue Team or on a Complaint Form with a notation that 
the complaint was resolved.   

11.  Routing of Complaint Forms:  All Complaint forms, either initiating 
a new complaint to be investigated at the Division level or one 
where the complaint has been investigated and resolved, will be 
routed to Internal Affairs for inclusion in the IA Pro data base. 

II.  COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION PROCESS GENERAL GUIDELINES:  

A.  Confidentiality of Investigative Process:  Prior to the completion of the 

investigation of a complaint, information concerning an investigation 
shall not be released outside the Department unless authorized by the 
Chief. Information gained during a complaint investigation will only be 
shared by personnel within the chain of command that have a valid 
need to know. 

B. 

Initiating the Investigation:  If the complaint is received at the Division 
Level, the commanding officer of the unit shall determine whether the 
matter can be appropriately dealt with at the unit level.  In such cases, 
commanding officers shall appoint an Investigator.   If the 
commanding officer determines that the complaint is not appropriate 
for investigation at the unit level, it shall be referred to the Internal 
Affairs unit for investigation. By direction of the Chief of Police, the 
Internal Affairs Unit may intervene at any time and assume control of 
any investigation. 

C.  Unless disruptive to the investigation, an investigating supervisor will 
make initial contact with a complainant within 72 hours of being

Extensions can be granted at the discretion of the Shift Commander. 

XII.  COMPLAINTS OF BIAS OR MISCONDUCT BY INVESTIGATORS 

A.  Complaints received from citizens or Department personnel who are 

the subject of a criminal investigation or prosecution that allege bias or

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

2.04.010  Internal Investigation/Discipline 

The purpose of this policy is to inform all employees of procedures governing 
disciplinary and corrective action for Class I Complaints. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

This policy is designed to provide a fair and just means for appropriate action 
when an employee's conduct reflects unfavorably on the department's ability to 
provide service or is detrimental to effective and efficient operations.  It is the 
department's policy to impose corrective and disciplinary action fairly and 
impartially and to offer adequate appeal procedures to ensure that the rights of 
employees are protected. 

DEFINITIONS 

Corrective Action:  Any remedial action taken by the Department in regards to an 
employee.  Corrective action is not discipline.  Corrective action includes: 

A. Formal Counseling. 

B. Education/Training. 

C. Medical Evaluation/Screening 

D. Psychological Evaluation/Screening. 

E. Transfer (involuntary and non-disciplinary for the good of the employee or 
the Department). 

F. Special Evaluation.  

Disciplinary Action:  An action taken against any employee of the Department for 
a violation of policy, procedure, or law where formal discipline is imposed.  With 
the exception of an oral reprimand, disciplinary action is documented on a 
Disciplinary Action Report (DAR) signed by both, the Chief of Police and the 
Director of Labor Relations, and entered in the employee‘s personnel file. 

Disciplinary actions include: 

  

A. Oral Reprimands:  An oral admonishment given to an employee by a 
Supervisor which meets both the following standards: 

1. The admonishment must be identified to the employee as an oral 
reprimand.   

2. The admonishment does not appear on a DAR.  The reprimand will be 
documented in IAPRO. 

B. Written Reprimands:  A written admonishment given to an employee by a 
commander which meets the following standards: 

1. The admonishment must be identified to the employee as a written 
reprimand. 

2. The admonishment appears on a DAR. 

C. Suspension from Duty (with or without pay). 

D. Suspension of Privileges (e.g., home car, building access, use of facilities, 
etc.). 

E. Transfer (disciplinary- either from shift or job assignment). 

F. Demotion in Rank. 

G. Termination of Employment. 

Findings: Findings are the results of the investigation. There are four possible 
findings: 

Sustained:  The internal investigation disclosed sufficient evidence to prove 
that the incident did occur and that the individual named in the complaint was 
responsible and was culpable. 

Not Sustained:  The investigation failed to disclose enough evidence to 
clearly prove or disprove the allegation, or the complainant failed to cooperate 
with the investigation and it was closed. 

Exonerated:  This finding states that the act that provided the basis for the 
complaint or allegation occurred; however, the investigation revealed that the 
act was justified, lawful, proper, and that no misconduct was involved. 

Unfounded:  The investigation conclusively proved that the incident did not 
occur, or that the employee named in the complaint was not involved.  

Administrative Review Board.  A panel that reviews, assesses, and recommends 
action on events assigned to it.  The Board shall normally hear matters of alleged 
regulation violations that could result in discipline of suspension or greater.  (See 
Administrative Policy:  General Review Board Policy) 

Progressive Discipline:  Under normal circumstances, discipline shall be imposed 
in a progressive manner in an attempt to influence the employee to correct 
behavior.  Discipline can progress incrementally from the lowest to the highest 
level; be reversed if infractions show improvement over previous infractions; and, 
depending on circumstances, steps can be skipped, particularly if the offense 

  

creates a serious result or liability for the Department.  Each case will be 
reviewed on a case-by-case analysis.  The steps of the progressive discipline 
system consist of oral reprimand, written reprimand, suspension and termination.  
All steps related to progressive discipline must be documented. 

Violation:  A sustained complaint of an act or omission contrary to any regulation, 
policy, or procedure.  A violation can subject the employee to any disciplinary or 
corrective action identified in this procedure. 

I. DISPOSITION OF COMPLAINTS 

PROCEDURE 

A. When an internal investigation is completed, the supervisor will submit the 
investigation to the unit or shift commander for review.  The commander will 
review the investigation with the supervisor and make a recommendation of 
corrective or disciplinary action to the chain of command. 

1. Commanders should consider the following for corrective action to 
apply: 

a). The seriousness of the offense as it relates to the nature and extent 
of damage or the potential damage or future liability to the Department. 

b). To ensure consistence to other employees to prevent similar 
infractions or to ensure that similar infractions will not occur or be 
tolerated. 

c). The employee's attitude about acknowledging doing wrong and 
making a commitment to improve; this includes the employee's 
cooperation in the investigation and resolution processes. 

d). The employee's previous disciplinary and performance records 
including, but not limited to: time between other offenses, the nature of 
other offenses, work productivity, attendance rates, cost of supervision, 
and types of performance errors. 

B. If the commander recommends discipline then the following procedure will 
be followed: 

1. All disciplinary recommendations shall be forwarded to the Chief of 
Police through the chain of command for information, review and 
comment.   

2. The Chief of Police will review the investigative report and supporting 
documents and may accept the findings and recommendations, change 
the findings and/or recommendations, or remand the case for additional 
investigation, all as a whole or in part.  

3. The Chief of Police has the final determination if the complaint is 
sustained, not sustained, exonerated, or unfounded. 

4. If the Chief of Police‘s findings concur with the recommended findings: 

  

a). A sustained case would follow the process described below in 
Section II, DISPOSING OF SUSTAINED COMPLAINTS. 

b). All case will be forwarded to Internal Affairs, for notification of the 
parties and filing of the case.  

5. If the Chief of Police does not concur with the recommended finding, 
the Chief of Police will provide a cover memo outlining the reason for 
his/her finding. 

a). If the Chief concurs, a memo will be attached to the complaint file 
and the process described below in Section II. DISPOSING OF 
SUSTAINED COMPLAINTS will be followed.   

b).If the Chief finds the complaint other than sustained, the memo will 
be attached to the case and forwarded to Internal Affairs for notification 
of the parties and filing of the case.  

II. DISPOSING OF SUSTAINED COMPLAINTS 

A. General.  This section details how the Department shall handle those 
complaints proven to be sustained.  In disposing of complaints, the 
Department shall be guided by good management practices and fundamental 
fairness. 

B. All employees have the right to be heard, prior to the final imposition of 
discipline, for proposed discipline that could result in termination, demotion, 
suspension, or, disciplinary transfer.  The employee may exercise the right to 
be heard in person before the Administrative Review Board.  If the proposed 
discipline may result in no greater than a written or oral reprimand, the 
employee may exercise the right to be heard in written form to the Board.  If 
the employee accepts the recommended discipline the Board does not need 
to be held. (See Administrative Procedures - Administrative Review Board) 

C. The Administrative Review Board reviews and assesses certain cases on 
behalf of the Chief of Police.  Members of the Administrative Review Board 
must not have made a predetermined decision regarding the level of 
discipline, though the employee shall have been presented with a draft DAR. 

D. Factors to be Considered.  When disposing of a sustained complaint, 
certain factors shall be considered and submitted into record.  These factors 
should include the following:  

1. All known aggravating factors. (This may include the discipline history of 
the employee; per current CBA). 

2. All mitigating factors. 

E. Objectives.  When reviewing a sustained complaint, the Administrative 
Review Board shall be guided by the objectives of:  

1. Good management principles and practices, to enhance the safe and 
efficient operation of the Department; 

  

2. Fundamental fairness to the parties involved; and 

3. Compliance with all applicable law and contractual considerations.   

F. Command Review.  When the Administrative Review Board recommends 
discipline of two week unpaid suspension or higher, including termination, the 
Chief of Police will meet with senior command staff, a member of City 
Employee Relations, and the Administrative Review Board to discuss the 
Board‘s recommendation prior to the Chief‘s determination of discipline. 

G. Concluding the Disposition.  Once an action is decided upon, the matter is 
concluded by: 

1. Completing a memo for the IA file, setting out the reasoning and 
describing the action to be taken; 

2. Serving the Disciplinary Action Report on the employee; 

3. Ensuring and recording with Internal Affairs an expeditious 
implementation of the prescribed sanction; and 

4. Returning the investigation documentation to Internal Affairs for 
notification to the complainant and filing of the investigative report. 

H. Discipline, Due-Dates and Extensions.  It is in the best interests of the 
employee, complainant and Department that disciplinary sanctions be 
imposed in a reasonable period of time.  Normally, discipline will be given a 
60 calendar day due-date from the date the investigation is completed. 

If it is anticipated that discipline will not be meted out within the designated 
period of time, Personnel supervisor shall prepare a written request to the 
Chief of Police submitted through the chain of command for an extension of 
this time.  This request shall be submitted within (5) working days of the due 
date.  The request shall indicate what remains to be done and an estimated 
time for completion.  The Personnel supervisor will notify the employee(s) of 
the new due date for the disciplinary sanction.  

IA will prepare a monthly report of the status of all pending administrative 
investigations with the originally assigned due dates and any new dates 
given.  This report will be made available to all commanding officers and the 
Chief of Police.   

III. INTERNAL AFFAIRS RECORDS AND CONFIDENTIALITY 

A. Internal Affairs shall be informed of all final disciplinary decisions.   

B. The Department‘s central personnel office shall forward a copy of all final 
DAR to Internal Affairs.  

C. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.   

D. Because they deal with personnel information, Internal Affairs files are 
considered confidential personnel records and will be retained under secure 
conditions within Internal Affairs and in accordance with Municipal Code and 
the current CBA.  

  

1. IA case files and personnel dispositions may not be released to any 
source without prior approval of the Chief of Police unless otherwise 
provided by law.  Before releasing an IA case file or personnel disposition, 
the Department shall provide at least 48 hours notice, if possible, to the 
employees who were the subject of and witnesses in the investigation of 
the intent to release the file. 

2. Case investigation files shall be retained for a period of time as defined 
by state law or the Chief of Police.  

3. IAPRO files may be accessed or reviewed during promotion, job 
transfer, or special assignment selection processes.  Commanders or 
supervisors may generate an IAPRO resume that will only list sustained 
complaints in which the employee was disciplined within the last two years 
and will list any awards and appreciations.

2.04.020  Supervisor Performance Log 

The purpose of this policy is to inform all employees of the procedures for using 
the Supervisory Performance Log. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

Evaluations are an important measure of an employee‘s work performance. As 
such, it is important that the evaluation be fair and accurate.  The Supervisors 
Performance Log is a tool supervisors will use to assist in drafting performance 
evaluations.  The log will not be used as a sole source of information for 
preparing evaluations.  Both positive and negative performance information 
should be recorded in the log.  

Supervisors will record Class II Complaints (as defined in the Internal 
Investigations policy) and their findings in the log.  Positive commendations from 
citizens about an employee‘s performance will also be recorded in the log.  The 
log will be maintained for one year, based on the annual evaluation due date of a 
particular employee.  Upon completion of the employee‘s annual evaluation, the 
log entries specific to that employee will be erased, and any new entries will be 
pertinent to the upcoming evaluation period. 

To understand this policy, employees must be familiar with the Internal 
Investigations policy. 

I. Supervisors Performance Log 

PROCEDURES 

A. The Supervisors Performance Log will be developed and maintained by IT 
and made available to Supervisors and Command Staff. 

B. The log will be used to document supervisory notes and is subject to MOA 
Personnel Rules.  The log will contain summaries of an employee‘s 
performance during the employee‘s annual evaluation period. 

  

C. Supervisors and Command Staff will access the log for official purposes 
only.  

D. Non-supervisory employees will not have access to any other employee‘s 
log. 

E. The log entries will be deleted upon completion of the annual employee 
evaluation process.  Log deletions can only be made by a Division Captain or 
higher command rank. 

F. The Division Captain is responsible for ensuring the log is erased upon 
completion of the evaluation review process. 

II. Supervisors and Commanders roles and responsibilities 

A. The log is to be used as a tool by supervisors in the preparation of an 
employee evaluation.  To accurately reflect employee performance, 
evaluations meriting ―Exceeds Expectations‖ and ―Does Not Meet 
Expectations,‖ should have supporting documentation in the log. 

1. Additional sources of information may be used to justify documentation 
of performance levels above or below, ―Meets Expectations‖ in the 
evaluation.  If other sources of information are used to justify an evaluation 
above or below ―Meets Expectations,‖ the supervisor will document the 
source of the information in the evaluation. 

2. Sustained Class II complaint(s) will be documented in the annual 
performance evaluation. 

B. Unit Commanders will periodically review employee logs to ensure 
accuracy and to provide oversight and compliance with this policy. 

C. If the Unit Commander determines that a Supervisor is not recording 
performance information, the Unit Commander will record the Supervisor‘s 
performance in the log.  This in turn will be reflected in the Supervisors annual 
evaluation. 

D. Supervisors will be responsible for recording all Class II Complaints in the 
log.  See the Internal Investigations policy for information on receiving 
complaints. 

1. If a Supervisor has a doubt or concern over the nature of a Class II 
Complaint, the Supervisor should consult with other Supervisors about the 
matter.  

2. If the potential outcome of a Class II Complaint is beyond the scope of a 
spot correction or counseling, the complaint will be investigated as a Class 
I Complaint. 

3. If at any time during a Class II Complaint investigation, a Supervisor 
determines that the complainant has provided false information 
concerning the complaint, or has a history of filling false complaints, the 
Supervisor shall covert the complaint to a Class I status. 

  

4. Supervisors should check the IAPro Persons File and perform a 
―Citizens Explore‖ search during the Class II Complaint investigation to 
see if the complainant has been, or is, a complainant in an IAPro entry. 
Supervisors should consult with Internal Affairs and determine if the 
complaint should be investigated as a Class I or Class II. 

5. Class I Complaints are not to be recorded in the log; they are to be 
processed according to the Internal Investigations policy. 

6. Class II Complaints will be recorded in the log, referencing the 
appropriate finding category. 

E. Supervisors will be responsible for recording positive employee 
performance actions that rise above normal work expectations in the log. 
Supervisors may also record exemplary work and/or citizen commendations 
into IAPro. 

F. Once a log entry has been made, it cannot be changed.  If additional 
information, or facts, changes the original entry, a new entry will be made 
clarifying the changes. 

G. Internal Affairs will review log entries as part of their oversight 
responsibility.  IA may reopen a Class II Complaint investigation if there is 
information of such a nature as to change the outcome of the original finding 
in the complaint.  This standard of review and change will be at the level of 
―just cause‖ to believe the information will change the outcome.  If a Class II 
Complaint is reopened, it will be investigated as a Class I Complaint. 

III. Employees roles and responsibilities 

A. Employees will have access to their specific log entries.  Employees 
should review the log for accuracy and completeness as part of a quarterly 
performance review to ensure the employee is on track with goals and 
objectives as stated in their annual evaluation.  

1. Employees may not change an entry, log entries are ―read only.‖ 
Employees may challenge an entry at which time the supervisor will 
record the challenge in the log.  Challenges to log entries should be made 
in writing to the employee‘s supervisor. 

2. The entries will remain in the log until the end of the annual evaluation 
period.  

B. If an employee becomes aware of information pertinent to their 
performance, they should bring it to the attention of their Supervisor for 
appropriate documentation in the log.

2.06.005  Use of AFD Aviation Support 

The purpose of this policy is to define the use and authorization of the Anchorage 
Fire Department Aircraft for Law Enforcement related incidents.

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

This chapter is provided for the purpose of ensuring the maximum degree of 
safety and efficiency in law enforcement aviation operations.  It is therefore 
essential that any Anchorage Police Department personnel who utilize the 
Anchorage Fire Department aircraft in the conduct of the Anchorage Police 
Department‘s missions, possess a complete knowledge of all safety aspects of 
helicopter operations.  Law enforcement aviation operations on occasions have 
special needs.  The carriages of weapons or canines on board are examples. 
Some missions are conducted in a higher-than-normal risk environment where 
the hazards on the ground from potential gunfire and apprehending suspects 
may be greater than, or compound, the hazards associated with the aviation 
mission.  Though this chapter and the Anchorage Fire Department policy may 
exempt Anchorage Police Department Personnel from some standard helicopter 
operating procedures, it must be emphasized that an exemption in one area does 
not automatically exempt Anchorage Police Department personnel from following 
other standard operating practices and procedures.

The purpose of this policy is to outline the procedure for notification, assistance 
and support of the families of Anchorage Police Department personnel who 
suffer serious injury or death in the line of duty. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

The Anchorage Police Department shall provide services to the family of any 
employee who is seriously injured or dies in the line of duty.  These services 
include timely notification of the injury or death, assisting the family at the 
hospital, supporting the family at a funeral and burial (if applicable), helping the 
family with benefits matters, supporting family through criminal proceedings (if 
any), and maintaining long-term contact with the family in the event of death. 

DISCUSSION 

One of the most challenging situations that a police department might face is the 
line of duty death or serious injury of an employee.  Coordination of events 
following the line-of duty death or serious injury of an employee is an extremely 
important and complex responsibility.  Professionalism and compassion must be 
exhibited at all times as an obligation to the member's survivors and to the law 
enforcement community. 

DEFINITIONS 

Survivors:  Those people within a deceased employee‘s family.  A ―family‖ 
consists of: spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, sibling, uncle, aunt, 
nephew or niece of the victim, whether related by blood, marriage or adoption; a 
person who lives, or has previously lived, in a spousal relationship with the 
victim; a person who is a former spouse of the victim; or domestic partners. 

Line of Duty Death:  The death of an active duty officer or employee by felonious 
or accidental means during the course of performing public safety functions while 
on-duty or off-duty. 

  

Serious Injury:  An incapacitating injury by felonious or accidental means during 
the course of performing public safety functions while on-duty or off-duty, 
requiring extended medical care of an active duty officer or employee  

PROCEDURE 

Each employee shall complete a emergency contact form provided by the 
department that gives the name(s) and contact information of immediate family 
members, domestic partners, or friends that the employee wishes to have 
personally notified in the event of a serious injury or death in the line of duty.  
This form will contain information from the employee giving instruction in case of 
serious injury or death in the line of duty.  These confidential forms will be 
maintained in a secure location within the Personnel Section and employees will 
be encouraged to update their forms once a year.  These forms will only be 
accessed by the employee to update the information or by personnel staff in case 
of death or serious injury in the line of duty. 

Should there be a serious injury or death of an employee, it will be the 
responsibility of the shift commander to immediately notify the Chief of Police, 
Deputy Chief of Operations and the Deputy Chief of Administration.  This can be 
done through the dispatch supervisor.  Other members of the Department will be 
notified at the direction of the Chief of Police.  The dispatch supervisor will notify 
the police chaplain. 

The following are the various responsibilities and positions that will be 
implemented to provide the best possible services and support to the member's 
family.  Specific tasks will be assigned to selected members of the Department 
by the Chief of Police or his designee.  The Chief of Police can select an 
individual to be responsible for several liaison assignments. 

Notification Officer:  A command staff member of the Department designated by 
the Chief of Police or his designee, to make the notification to the member's 
family. 

Hospital Liaison Officer:  A sergeant or commander who has been assigned to 
act as the liaison between the hospital and the Department. 

Family Liaison Officer:  A sergeant or commander who has been assigned by the 
Chief of Police to act as the liaison between the family and the Department. 

Department Liaison Officer:  A sergeant or command staff member who will 
coordinate the Department's response to the family and the news media. This 
person will be responsible for coordinating the funeral and related activities.  The 
officer will also be a liaison between the family and the Anchorage Police 
Department Personnel Division. 

Police Chaplain:  The chaplain will assist all the liaison officers and be another 
contact for the family. 

I. Notification Officer: 

  

A. In the event of a serious injury or death to a department employee in the 
line of duty, the notification of the family will be generally in accordance with 
this policy. 

B. The on-duty Shift Commander will make personal notification to the 
persons listed by the employee on their emergency contact form.  While these 
notifications should be in person, it is recognized that extenuating 
circumstances may sometimes make that impossible.  Such incidents should 
be rare. In the event a person named by the employee resides outside the 
jurisdiction of the Anchorage Police Department, the shift commander shall 
determine if it is practical and expeditious to go there personally (or by 
designee), or if a request should be made to a law enforcement agency 
having jurisdiction for the location to make such notification on behalf of this 
department. 

C. The principles of death notification are: 

1. The name of the deceased member will never be released to the news 
media until after the family and/or immediate survivors are notified. 

2. In person:  Such notifications should always be in person.  If necessary, 
an officer from another jurisdiction may be requested to make the 
notification where the family member resides. 

3. In time:  There should be an immediate and timely notification.  News of 
such events will travel fast, and it is important that the survivors hear the 
news from a reliable source. 

4. In pairs:  The notification officer with another officer or with a clergy 
member should make the notification.  Before they arrive, the notification 
team should decide who will speak, what will be said, and how much will 
be said.  Many times the survivors may react in a manner requiring 
medical attention, or there may be more than one person in the home to 
deal with. 

5. In plain language:  The notification should be straight forward and 
honest.  As many questions from the survivors should be answered at this 
time.  Always remember to refer to the deceased officer by name.  State 
that the officer died in clear terms, never leave doubt or suspense or 
create false hope.  Avoid terms such as ―passed away‖, or that ―God 
chose this time to take him/her‖. 

6. With compassion:  Offer to assist the survivors with contacting other 
family members, their chosen clergy, or friends.  Never make statements 
like "I know how you feel" unless you have actually been a survivor in 
identical circumstances.  Remember that you are creating a memory for 
the survivor that will be with them for the rest of their life. 

7. The notifying party should assist the family as long as the officer's 
presence is needed.  Officers should offer to transport an employee's 
immediate family by police vehicle to the local hospital, if such need for 

  

transportation is advised due to lack of available transportation or the 
emotional state of the family member. 

8. Prior to leaving for the hospital, the Notification Officer should make 
contact with the Hospital Liaison Officer and advise that officer that the 
family is en route to the hospital.  This should be done by telephone only. 

9. A Command Staff Officer should respond to either the residence or the 
hospital to meet with the family as soon as possible. 

II. Hospital Liaison Officer: 

A. The officer or supervisor who accompanies the injured or deceased 
employee to the hospital will function as the Hospital Liaison Officer, until 
such time as relieved by the appointed Hospital Liaison Officer. 

B. The Hospital Liaison Officer will be responsible for coordinating the 
activities of hospital personnel, fellow police officers, the member's family, the 
press and others that may be involved. 

C. Arrange with hospital personnel to provide an appropriate waiting facility 
for the family, the Chief of Police, the Notification Officer and only those 
people that the surviving family wishes to be there. 

D. In the case of death, the Hospital Liaison Officer will arrange for the Police 
Chaplain to have access to the deceased employee to drape the body with a 
flag. 

E. Arrange with hospital personnel for a second area for police officers and 
friends of the employee to assemble. 

F. In conjunction with the hospital, arrange through the Departments 
P.I.C.R.U. for a place to use as a press staging area. 

G. Ensure that medical personnel relay pertinent information regarding the 
employee's condition to the family on a timely basis and before the 
information is released to others. 

H. Notify the appropriate hospital personnel that all medical bills relating to 
the injured or deceased employee will be directed to the Personnel office of 
the Anchorage Police Department.  The family should not receive these bills 
at their residence. This may require the Hospital Liaison Officer to contact the 
hospital during normal business hours to ensure the proper billing will take 
place. 

I. If possible, arrangements should be made with hospital personnel to allow 
the family to visit with the employee.  It is important that the family be 
prepared for what they might see in the Emergency Room.  If the family 
requests, an officer should accompany the family. It should be remembered 
that there is a definite need to touch and hold the employee.  

J. Officers should not be overly protective of the family.  This means that 
specific information should be shared with the family when appropriate.  This 
should include how the employee met his/her death. 

  

K. The Hospital Liaison Officer and the Notification Officer(s) will remain at 
the hospital as long as the deceased employee's family is present. 

L. It will further be the responsibility of the Hospital Liaison Officer to take 
custody of the deceased officer's duty weapon, ammunition and other 
equipment that can be released prior to the officer's remains being 
transported to the medical examiner‘s office. 

III. Family Liaison Officer: 

A. The Chief of Police will designate an officer to act as liaison between the 
Department and the deceased officer's family.  This is not a decision making 
position, but is that of a facilitator between the family and the Department. 

B. The Family Liaison Officer should be a sergeant or commander who knew 
the deceased officer, but should not be an officer who is so emotionally 
involved in the death of the officer as to render him/her ineffective.  The Chief 
of Police may assign other officers or chaplain as necessary to assist the 
Family Liaison Officer.  

C. Ensure the needs and the wishes of the family come before the wishes of 
the Department. 

D. In the event of a death: maintain a detailed record of assignments and 
duties associated with the wake and the funeral. 

E. Determine what type of funeral the family desires. Meet with the family and 
advise them of what the Department can offer if they decide to have a line of 
duty death funeral.  If they should choose this, explain the funeral procedure 
(i.e., 21-Gun Salute, presentation of the flag, playing of "TAPS", etc.).  If the 
family chooses any of these options, it will be the responsibility of the Family 
Liaison Officer to notify the Department Liaison of this. 

F. Apprise the family of information concerning the investigation into the death 
of the employee. 

G. Provide as much assistance as possible to the family.  This may include 
assisting them in making travel and lodging arrangements for out of town 
family members. 

H. Notify Concerns of Police Survivors (C.O.P.S) at (773) 205-7868 and local 
representative.  Members of this group are survivors of officers that have died 
in the line of duty and are available to provide emotional support to the 
families. 

I. Work closely with the Department Liaison Officer. 

J. The Family Liaison Officer will recover any gear and equipment from the 
officer‘s home. 

K. Support for the family awaiting trial for those responsible. 

1. This is a very important part of the grieving process and there are a 
number of things that should be done so the family does not feel left out or 

  

feel the Department is hiding something from them.  There are a number 
of ways to prevent this.  

2. If not done at this point, the family should be met with and the 
circumstances surrounding the officer's death should be explained to 
them.  If there are investigative reasons why certain details cannot be 
released prior to the trial, this should be explained to them. 

3. The family should never hear of court or parole hearings from the media 
first.  It is the responsibility of the Department to keep the family advised of 
all legal proceedings. 

4. Family members should be encouraged to attend the trial so they feel 
they are representing the slain officer's interests. 

5. The Family Liaison Officer should be assigned to accompany the family 
throughout the trial.  This officer can explain the proceedings to the family 
and advise them of testimony that may be upsetting to them.  The officer 
should remember not to be overly protective of the family.  It is the 
decision of the family whether or not to attend the trial. 

6. Members of the Department should be encouraged to attend the trial.  
This is not only comforting to the family, but also may be beneficial to the 
members of the Department that were close to the fallen officer. 

L. An employee who was close to the fallen officer should be assigned to 
assemble a scrapbook to give to the family, along with any plaques or 
memorabilia that will be given to the family.  The remembrance book could 
include newspaper articles, remembrances from fellow employees, etc. 

IV. Department Liaison Officer 

A. This position will normally be assigned to a Command Staff Officer or 
sergeant due to the need to effectively coordinate the Department resources. 

B. Work closely with the Family Liaison Officer to ensure the needs of the 
family are fulfilled.  

C, Be available to handle any and all inquires from the news media 
throughout the ordeal, should the family want this service.  If the family 
decides to accept an interview, the Department Liaison Officer or his/her 
designee will be present to screen questions presented to the family. 

D. Gather information on all benefits and funeral payments that are available 
to the survivors.  The Officer will be responsible for the following: 

1. Assist the family in the filing of Worker's Compensation claims and 
other related paperwork. 

2. Contact the Personnel office to ensure the correct paperwork is filed for 
survivor benefits and work with the Personnel office to ensure all monies 
due to the deceased officer are paid. 

  

3. Prepare a printout of benefits available to the surviving family, listing 
benefits available to the named survivors, along with contacts for the 
various benefits. 

4. Meet with the surviving family a few days following the funeral to 
discuss the benefits they will be receiving and provide them with a copy of 
the printout.  If there are surviving children from a previous marriage who 
did not reside with the deceased officer, they also should be provided with 
a copy of any benefits due them. 

5. Meet with the family approximately six months following the funeral to 
ensure they have received all the benefits that are due to them. 

E. Meet with the following persons in order to coordinate funeral activities: 

1. The Chief of Police and Senior Staff 

2. Honor Guard Coordinator 

3. Funeral Director/Funeral Home 

4. Clergy 

5. Cemetery Director 

F. Coordinate the activities of the Department and visiting police departments 
according to the wishes of the family. 

G. Issue an itinerary to include the following information: 

1. Name of deceased officer 

2. Date and time of death 

3. Circumstances surrounding the death 

5. Uniform to be worn 

6. Expressions of sympathy in lieu of flowers 

4. Funeral Arrangements (state if service will be private or a police funeral) 

7. Name and telephone number of the contact person for visiting 
departments to indicate their desire to attend and to obtain further 
information 

H. Obtain an American Flag. If the family wishes presentation of the flag by 
the Chief of Police, notify the Chief. 

I. If the family desires a burial in uniform, select an officer to obtain a uniform 
and leather gear and deliver the items to the funeral home. 

J. Arrange for delivery of the officer's personal belongings to the family. 

K. Ensure the Chief of Police is briefed on the arrangements and that 
Department employees are aware of duties as outlined in the itinerary. 

L. Ensure the surviving parents are afforded recognition and that proper 
placement is arranged for them during the wake and the funeral. 

  

M. Coordinate traffic management with other jurisdictions, if necessary, to 
accommodate the procession and funeral. 

N. Maintain a roster of all visiting departments sending personnel to the 
funeral, including: 

1. Name and address of the responding agency 

2. Name of the Chief of Police 

3. Number of Officers attending 

4. Number of vehicles 

O. Acknowledge visiting departments. 

P. Make arrangements for routine checks of the survivor's home for a period 
of six-eight weeks following the funeral.  If the survivors live out of town, make 
arrangements with the agency for the town of residence.  This is done due to 
the amount of money that passes through the residence and the fact that the 
survivors will be out of the residence attending to legal matters. 

V. Police Chaplain: 

A. Will assist all liaison officers. 

VI. Continued Support for the Family 

B. Will provide a flag to be draped over the deceased officer at the hospital. 

A. Members of the Department must remain sensitive to the needs of the 
survivors long after the officer's death.  The grief process has no timetable 
and survivors may develop a complicated grief process.  More than half of the 
surviving spouses can be expected to develop a post-traumatic stress 
reaction to the tragedy. 

B. Survivors should continue to feel a part of the "police family".  They should 
be invited to Anchorage Police Department and APDEA activities for 
continued support. 

C. Members of the Department are encouraged to keep in touch with the 
family.  Close friends, co-workers and staff should arrange with the family to 
visit the home from time to time, as long as the family expresses a desire to 
have these contacts continue. 

D. The Department should maintain close contact with the family as long as 
the family feels need for the support.  The family will let it be known when 
they are ready to move on and live their lives without the assistance of the 
Department. 

VII. Post Incident Stress of Department Personnel 

A. Family members, friends and close associates of the fallen employee will 
experience various levels of grief.  However, the need for the Police 
Department to provide psychological assistance or post incident debriefing 
cannot be stressed strongly enough.  The loss of a co-worker is often the 

  

most traumatic experience that an employee may experience in his or her 
career. 

VIII. Funeral Protocol 

A. Any Anchorage Police Officer who dies in the line of duty will be accorded 
full honors if requested by the family.  This will include the Casket Watch 
during the wake, Honor Guard, pallbearers, rifle squad, taps, military flag fold, 
and presentation of the flag and motor escort. 

B. The Honor Guard Coordinator will be responsible for coordinating and 
directing the activities of the Honor Guard, Casket Watch, Pallbearers, Rifle 
Squad, Bugler and Flag presentation and will be under the direct supervision 
of the Department Liaison Officer. 

1. Uniforms and Appearances 

i. Class A uniforms will be worn by all personnel 

ii. A black band will be worn over the badge. 

2. Wake 

i. All members of the Department who attend the wake will, regardless 
of assignment, dress in the appropriate dress uniform. 

C. The Casket Watch is comprised of volunteer officers from throughout the 
Department.  Officers assigned to the casket watch must present an excellent 
uniform appearance and will conform to all Department regulations on 
grooming and appearance. 

1. The dress uniform will be worn to include white gloves.  The watch will 
be divided into shifts with two officers standing watch for 2 to 4 hours at a 
time. 

2. A shift supervisor will organize the casket watch immediately following 
the line of duty death, until the Honor Guard Coordinator is able to take 
over the responsibility.  

D. The Honor Guard Coordinator will post the watch and the officers will 
position themselves at or near the head and feet of the deceased officer. 

E. If the family requests pallbearers from the Department or they have no 
special request for who will serve as pallbearers, the Honor Guard 
Coordinator will be responsible for selecting them.  If possible and practical, 
the pallbearers should be officers that the slain officer worked closely with, 
regardless of rank.  Pallbearers will be under the direct command of the 
Honor Guard Coordinator and will report to the funeral home as directed for 
instructions. 

A. Refer to the funeral procedures outline in the Anchorage Police 
Department Funeral Planning Guide or based upon the requests of the family. 

IX. Funeral Procedures 

X. Procedural Variation 

  

A. The procedures that have been outlined in this policy will be followed in 
most cases.  Any changes that are made necessary by shortage of 
manpower, the unusual size of the funeral, the type of service, the physical 
arrangement of the place of the service or for any other reasons, shall be 
made by the Department Liaison Officer in conjunction with the Chief of 
Police. 

B. In the case of an officer killed in the line of duty, the Chief of Police or his 
designee will make arrangements for two officers to escort the deceased 
officer‘s family to the Police Memorial Wall ceremony in Washington DC. 

C. At the discretion of the Chief of Police, Department Honors may be 
accorded to deceased members of the Department.

University course from any jurisdiction (as above). A list of the qualifying 
courses must be attached to the final Selection Score Sheet. One (1) point 
is awarded for each completed course. 

5. Maximum total points awarded cannot exceed 20. 

E. Discipline/P-File (5%):  No discipline will net five (5) points. 

1. Points will only be deducted from that five (5) points for a formal oral 
reprimand, written reprimand, or suspension of less than 2 days within the 
previous two (2) years or which remains in the Personnel file consistent 
with the current labor contract. 

a). One (1) point deduction for each oral reprimand in last year 

b). Three (3) point deduction for each written reprimand in last year 

c). Five (5) point deduction for a suspension in last two (2) years. 

2. The maximum deduction is five (5) points yielding a score of zero (0) for 
this category. 

3. Maximum total points awarded cannot exceed 5 points 

4. Multiple disciplinary actions requiring a DAR or suspensions in excess 
of one day may, after evaluation by the chain of command, render the 
applicant ineligible. 

F. Resume:  A Resume and point evaluation for categories outside of the Oral 
Board shall be submitted by the applicant at the time of the Oral Board to be 
considered for points.  Rating Officials will review the scores with the 
applicant at the conclusion of the Oral Board.  Confirmation of validity can be 
sought through the Personnel file and IAPro.  Employees should review their 
Personnel file and confirm the file is current.  Resumes will include a cover 
sheet outline highlighting point evaluation under each of the above 
categories. Additional information and/or documentation may be attached to 
the outline. 

G. Ranked List:  A ranked list will be developed using a Basic Selection 
Process score sheet provided by the Captain of Administration.  The scores 
will be independently determined by the Process Facilitator and another 
supervisor or commander. The ranked list will be used in selection, provided 
there are substantially different qualifications between candidates.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

2.06.030  Travel Procedures Policy 

To establish policies and procedures to approve travel requests, process travel 
activity, and pay travel expenses. 

All employees will follow department policy in procuring travel authorization and 
payment or Municipal policy if travel is outside of that described in this policy. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DEFINITIONS 

Anchorage Area:  The Municipality of Anchorage (from the Knik River Bridge to 
Portage). 

APD Travel Coordinator: Contact person within APD that will initiate and process 
all travel paperwork.  Current designations are Fiscal Clerk, Executive Assistant 
to the Chief, and Detective Clerk. 

Approval:  Authorization to travel or authorization for expense reimbursement.  
Approval must be obtained through the appropriate Chain of Command process. 

Chain of Command:  Chain of Command is defined as the lines of 
communication, responsibility, and authority going upward and downward within 
the organizational hierarchy through each successive level of supervision.  In 
applying this definition, an employee must direct/receive Official 
Communication(s) through his or her Supervisor(s).  Each person within the 
Chain of Command has the inherent responsibility and authority to make 
decisions and provide solutions for those under their supervision. 

International Travel:  Travel outside of the United States.  Travel to U.S. 
territories is not considered to be international travel.  International travel must be 
submitted to the Mayor for approval after Chain of Command approval. 

Per Diem:  The rate of pay per day for meals and other miscellaneous expenses.  
This rate is reduced on travel days per IRS regulations. 

  

Prohibited Expenses:  Prohibited expenses will not be reimbursed by the 
Municipality.  They include, but are not limited to: 1) ―buying‖ frequent flyer miles 
from employees who use miles to obtain airline tickets, 2) passport fees, 3) 
travel/rental car insurance, 4) alcohol, 5) the use of personal watercraft, 6) cruise 
ship conferences, 7) the use of personal aircraft, 8) dry cleaning and laundry 
charges and 9) business meals (unless in compliance with MOA P&P 68-3). 

Request for Professional or Technical Training/Development:  A form to be 
completed when travel is for training purposes. 

Travel:  Travel outside of the Anchorage Area, but inside the United States, 
unless otherwise noted. 

Traveler:  Any individual traveling on behalf of the Municipality. Travelers are not 
necessarily employees.  Contractor travel need not comply with this policy. 

Travel Authorization:  The form showing the trip details and approval(s). 

Travel Day:  The day of departure from and the day of return to the point of 
origin. 

Travel Expense Report:  The report showing details of the expenses, the 
accounting distributions, and approvals. 

DISCUSSION 

This policy applies to all APD employees, sworn and non-sworn, who are 
traveling on Anchorage Police Department-related business.  This policy in no 
way supersedes MOA Travel Procedure Guide 68-1 (11/1/2008).  It is the 
employee‘s responsibility to read and understand MOA P&P 68-1. 

For the Anchorage Police Department‘s parameters on compensation on travel 
related to Department-sponsored training, optional training and mandatory work 
travel/training, see Appendix A ―Guidelines for Travel and Training Pay Rate 
Compensation‖ at the end of this policy. 

For travel conducted for business, training and investigation purposes by 
Anchorage Police Department personnel, this policy sets out guidelines and 
instructions that shall be followed.  Travel must be approved in advance.  The 
consequence of unauthorized travel could be non-reimbursement.  Failure to 
follow these work instructions/guidelines may result in discipline. 

I.  GENERAL 

PROCEDURE 

A.  Regardless if travel is paid for by a grant, APD, any other law enforcement 
agency, or zero travel, arrangements shall not be reserved or purchased 
until travel paper work has been approved through employees‘ Chain of 
Command and notification of approval has been received from the Fiscal 
Clerk. 

II.  TRAVEL AUTHORIZATION AND APPROVAL 

  

A.  The requesting employee must first meet with an APD Travel Coordinator 
to initiate a Travel Authorization form and Request for Training form.  The 
employee must identify the funding source before meeting with an APD 
Travel Coordinator.  An APD Travel Coordinator will research quotes and 
costs, complete the form, including employee signature, and deliver, with 
all attachments, to the Fiscal Clerk. The Fiscal Clerk will complete the 
budget information and forward forms through the approval Chain of 
Command.  The Fiscal Clerk will be the final point of contact for all forms. 

B.  If employees travel outside the Anchorage Area with their APD assigned 
car, they are required to obtain permission from their Chain of Command. 

C.  Prior to a request for travel, the employee will check in the electronic 
timekeeping system for scheduled court cases during the employee‘s 
absence.  If there is a conflict, this must be resolved prior to making travel 
arrangements or leaving town. 

D.  It is also the responsibility of employees and their Chain of Command to 

arrange the travel and training to minimize overtime costs to the 
Department.  (Refer to Appendix A ―Guideline for Travel and Training Pay 
Rate Compensation‖) 

E.  If it is last minute travel and an APD Travel Coordinator is not available, 

employees shall contact their Chain of Command for directions. 

III.  BUSINESS/PERSONAL TRAVEL 

A.  Employees who wish to combine personal travel in conjunction with the 

training/conference must document this request during the initial visit with 
an APD Travel Coordinator.  The employee(s) are responsible for all 
expenses connected with the personal travel.  If an employee takes 
personal time along with the business, the APD Travel Coordinator is 
required to submit two flight itineraries; one with the business and the 
personal dates, the second with just the business dates.  If there is a 
difference of price where the combined business and personal travel is 
more expensive than just the business travel, the employee is responsible 
for the difference.  On all combined business/personal itineraries, the APD 
Travel Coordinator must also have a printed copy of the business-only 
flight quoted on the same date that the combined airfare is purchased.  
This must be submitted with the travel expense report. 

III.  RENTAL CAR 

A.  The Department will not pay for rental cars when the conference is held in 
the hotel where employees are staying or transportation is provided to and 
from the conference site.  If the employees believe they need a rental car 
to attend the training or conference then employees shall make a request 
through an APD Travel Coordinator with the proper documentation to 
support the request. The APD Travel Coordinator will forward the request 
through the Chain of Command to the Captain level or higher for a 
decision.   

  

B.  If a rental car is approved, the Department will pay for a compact or 

midsize car, whichever is cheaper.  Most rental car companies do not 
accept 3rd party credit cards for rented vehicles and the employee may 
need to use a personal credit card to obtain the rental. 

C.  If the MOA rents a car for an employee, it is for business purposes only (to 
and from the airport, training site, and meals).  The city is self-insured, 
therefore will not pay for insurance.  If the employee intends to use this 
vehicle for personal business, then it is the employee‘s responsibility to 
insure the vehicle through their personal insurance or by purchasing the 
car rental company‘s insurance; however, the employee will not be 
reimbursed for this expense.  Whenever employees rent a vehicle for 
business purposes and use it for personal use, they shall fill out the Rental 
Car Fuel Pro-rater form, available through an APD Travel Coordinator, 
and submit it with their expense report. 

IV. RESERVATIONS AND BOOKING ARRANGEMENTS 

A.  Once travel paperwork has been approved, notification will be sent from 
the Fiscal Clerk and an APD Travel Coordinator will book the flight and 
hotel reservations and will contact the training agency concerning 
registration.  APD receives miles, as does the traveler, through both 
EasyBiz (Alaska Airlines) and Sky Bonus (Delta).  Research must still be 
done to make sure the Department gets the best ticket price.  Sometimes 
there is a significant difference of several hundred dollars for a single 
ticket.  A good rule of thumb is a price difference of $100 or more.  Travel 
must be booked with the cheaper airline or employees must justify to their 
Chain of Command why the more expensive ticket is the best option. 

B.  The Department is willing to accommodate employees‘ travel needs as 

much as possible, however, keep in mind that we should still be prudent in 
our spending even if travel is being paid for by grant monies or another 
agency.  Department personnel may be required to share a room and/or 
rental vehicles. The APD Travel Coordinator will book a reasonably priced 
room for each employee.  If employees want to upgrade their room, they 
are responsible for the difference or must obtain permission through their 
Chain of Command up to the Captain level. 

C.  Employees are permitted to leave their conference/training session up to 
two hours early in order to catch a reasonable flight back to Anchorage.  
They are also permitted to miss a banquet or dinner at the end of the 
conference/training in order to catch a reasonable flight back to 
Anchorage. 

D.  If a conference or training session ends by noon or early afternoon, in time 

for employees to find a reasonable return flight home, travelers are 
required to return to Anchorage the same day.  However, if the conference 
or training does not conclude until 5:00 PM or later and travelers cannot 
find a reasonable flight home, they are permitted to stay overnight and 
lodging and per diem will be covered by the Department.  If employees 

  

choose to extend their stay at the end of the conference, they will be 
responsible for all additional expenses and the MOA will not pay the 
employees per diem for the extra days. 

E.  Employees will be responsible to ensure the airline ticket, hotel 

reservations, dates of travel, seminar/class registration, as well as any 
other information is correct. If not, employees will contact and work with an 
APD Travel Coordinator to correct it.  Some errors can be changed or 
corrected within 24 hours without additional charges to the Department or 
employees. 

V.  CHANGES TO TRAVEL ITINERARY 

A.  If changes are required on approved future travel, these changes must 

be done by the Fiscal Clerk. 

B.  In the event employees cannot attend training or a conference after the 

travel arrangements have already been made, they shall contact an APD 
Travel Coordinator and their Chain of Command as soon as possible.  
An APD Travel Coordinator will cancel all reservations. 

C.  If an employee changes their return flight for personal reasons (other 

then a family emergency), they will be responsible for all change fees as 
well as turning in revised paperwork.  Employees who attend training in 
which their salary, travel, and training expenses are in full or partly paid 
for by the Anchorage Police Department or through a grant managed 
through the Anchorage Police Department are required to attend and 
complete that training.  If an employee has a personal or family 
emergency that requires them to cut the trip short, they shall contact or 
attempt to contact someone in their Chain of Command before leaving. 

VI. TRAVEL EXPENSE REPORT 

A.  When an employee returns from travel, the employee has 30 days to 

complete the Travel Expense Report.  Employees shall provide an APD 
Travel Coordinator: 

1.  Original receipts for lodging, parking, baggage, fuel, airport shuttle 

or taxi, etc. 

2.  Airline boarding passes. 

3.  Event brochure and agenda if travel was for a conference, 

seminar, or training. 

B.  An APD Travel Coordinator will complete the expense report, have the 

employee sign it, and submit the completed form and original receipts to 
the Fiscal Clerk.  The Fiscal Clerk will forward the form for Chain of 
Command signatures. 

  

Guideline for Travel and Training Pay Rate Compensation 

APPENDIX A 

 

I.  Department Sponsored and Approved Training: 

A.  Employees desiring to attend training shall submit an application in the 

form and manner specified by the Training Section or Chain of Command 
expressed by conventional posting or other Department-authorized 
method. Applicants shall be selected in a method prescribed by the Chain 
of Command, consistent with Department and Municipal policy/procedure 

1.  Training is considered work and the employee must be afforded an 8-

hour break both before and after training that spans 8 hours or more (a 
shift). 

2.  Training 5 days or more in length: Employees who have worked 40 
hours will transition to a 5 day/9 hours (unpaid lunch) schedule with 
two days off before and after the work week. Employees who have 
worked less then 40 hours will receive one day off and then transition 
into a 5 day/9 hours schedule with two days off after the training.  
Supervisors shall ensure the employees are given the number of days 
off on the front side and/or back side of the training to ensure that 
employees do not work more than 40 hours in a row or week and/or 80 
hours in a pay period. 

3.  Training less than 5 days in length: Supervisors shall ensure 

employees comply with the current restrictions for number of hours 
worked and that there is at least an 8-hour break between shifts 
utilizing training leave and adjust work hours when necessary.  
Employees shall also be given training leave for the next shift if they do 
not get 8 straight hours off due to court obligations or an emergency 
call-out.  

4.  Temporary Duty Assignment: Employees who attend training 5 days or 
more in length will be placed on Temporary Duty Assignment (TDA) to 
Training. This status has certain administrative impact, including: 

a)  Those employees on TDA will not be eligible for overtime call-in 
during the period of the school, but will still be responsible for 
satisfying all normal court obligations, and are eligible to respond to 
emergency call-outs of specialized units of which those employees 
are members. If the employees are on an extended call-out they 
will work with their Chain of Command to determine if and when 
they will resume the training schedule. 

b)  Employees are not eligible for posted overtime during the duration 
of the training. Employees shall not work a posted overtime if it 
interferes with their 8 straight hours off between the end of a shift 
and the beginning of training, or after training and the beginning of 

  

the next shift. The only exception to this rule is if employees signed 
up for and were selected for the posted overtime, prior to being 
selected for the training. Employees that find themselves in this 
circumstance shall work with their Chain of Command to resolve 
the conflict. 

5.  Compensation: If the training occurs on an employee‘s day off, the 
employee shall be compensated at the appropriate overtime or 
compensatory time rate per the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  In 
cases where the training is not approved in the sense that all costs 
have been approved, training leave may be granted for voluntary 
attendance at training at the discretion of the administration. 

Travel time that occurs during the during the normal work hours, 
including days worked and scheduled days off, is compensable. 
However, outside of normal work hours, it is generally not 
compensable. 

II.  Optional Travel and Training:  

A.  Includes out of state and some in-state training for professional 

development that has not been approved by the APD Administration.  If an 
employee chooses on their own to attend training which has not been 
specifically approved by the APD Administration, no expenses will be paid 
by the MOA, nor will there be an adjustment to the work schedule. 

1.  Regarding out of state training, as a general rule, overtime will not be 

compensated for optional training unless approved at the Captain level 
or higher in the Chain of Command. 

III.  Mandatory Training and Mandatory Work Related Travel: 

A.  Mandatory training is all training that employees are required to attend by 
their Chain of Command. Mandatory work-related travel is travel that is 
required as part of an employee‘s assignment (i.e. - background 
investigator, to testify in court, and to facilitate a police investigation). 

1.  Mandatory Travel and Training 5 days or more in length: Employees 
who have worked 40 hours will transition to a 5 day/9 hours (unpaid 
lunch) schedule with two days off before and after the work week. 
Employees who have worked less than 40 hours will receive one day 
off and then transition into a 5 day/9 hours schedule with two days off 
after the training. If the training is two weeks or more in duration, 
employees will continue, after the initial week, in the 5 day/9 hours 
(unpaid lunch) schedule with two days off before and after the training. 
Supervisors shall ensure the employees are given the number of days 
off on the front side and/or back side of the training to ensure that 
employees do not work more than 40 hours in a row or week and/or 80 
hours in a pay period. 

2.  Mandatory Travel and Training less than 5 days in length: Employees 

who have worked less than 40 hours in the work week and are 

  

required to travel or attend training within less than 8 hours of the end 
of that shift shall be given training leave for that shift. Employees shall 
also be given training leave for the shift before or after the 
training/travel if they do not get 8 straight hours off due to court 
obligations or an emergency call-out. Employees will be given the 
number of days off on the front side and/or back side of the training to 
ensure that the they) do not work more than 40 hours in a row or week 
and/or 80 hours in a pay period.  

3.  Compensation: As a general rule, overtime incurred for mandatory 
training/work on a scheduled day off and travel during normal work 
hours on a day off will be compensated at an employee‘s normal rate 
of paid overtime or compensatory time per the labor contract. 

a). Training/work that exceeds employees‘ normal daily work hours or 
TDA training schedule will be compensated at the normal rate of 
paid overtime or compensatory time per the CBA. 

b). Exception: Employees who do Department-related work while 

traveling shall be compensated at normal rate of overtime pay or 
compensatory time per the CBA. Employees shall receive 
permission from their Chain of Command before doing work while 
traveling during the time frame when they are entitled to no more 
than hour for hour compensation as required by this policy.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a

with the laws governing employee discipline. 

2.07.000  Job Assignments 

2.07.005  Light Duty Assignments and Obligations 

The purpose of this policy is to define the duties and responsibilities of 
Department personnel while assigned to light duty. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DEFINITIONS 

REFERENCES 

PROCEDURES 

That all light duty assignments be authorized, granted and documented 
according to sound management and accounting principles.  It shall be the policy 
of the Anchorage Police Department to strictly adhere to the requirements set 
forth in the policy.  

Light Duty: a temporary measure utilized to facilitate the return of an employee to 
their regular job duties. 

Municipal Personnel Rules and existing labor contract(s) between the 
Municipality and the Anchorage Police Department Employees' Association are 
the primary reference documents to this chapter. 

I. Introduction: There are occasions where employees are encouraged, required, 
or wish to return to work, but their medical condition(s) do not allow full 
performance of their normal job duties.  In this sense, they are "absent" from their 
regular position, but not on a leave status.  Therefore, when a physician releases 
an employee for work, but with limitations that do not allow the employee to 
perform to the full capacity of their job description, that employee shall be placed 
on Light Duty status.  Employees will be assigned to a job that will permit them to 
work within the physician's guidelines until their release to full duty. 

  

A. Eligibility and Purpose:  Light Duty status is available to all ill or injured 
employees who can obtain a release from their physician to perform certain 
restricted duties.  The opportunity to return to work, even on a limited basis, 
often hastens the recovery time from illnesses and injuries, while the 
Department enjoys certain productivity from the employee. 

B. Application:  Employees who receive a release from the physician must 
return to or be ordered to return to duty on a limited capacity, according to the 
guidelines prescribed by the physician.  No overtime will be permitted while 
on light duty, except under exigent circumstances and with the approval of the 
Division Commander. 

C. Assignments:  If the light duty assignment is 40 hours or less in length, 
there will be no involuntary change in shifts or days off.  If the light duty 
assignment is more than 40 hours, the employee will be assigned to day shift, 
with a 5/9‘s schedule with an unpaid lunch until released to full duty.  Once 
the employee is placed in light duty status, the Captain supervising the 
Personnel Division will assign that employee to his/her duties, providing the 
physician‘s medical limitations are met.  

D. ACTING POSITION/TRANSFER/PROMOTIONS:  A light duty employee is 
allowed to transfer or promote based on the Chief‘s approval.  A light duty 
employee will not be allowed to take on an ―Acting‖ roll. 

E. Obligations of Employees on Light Duty:  While on light duty, sworn 
employees are assumed incapable of performing the duties normally required 
of their position.  Of particular concern are the special precautions necessary 
to avoid taking police action, or acting under color of authority, except under 
the most extreme circumstances.  In anticipation of possible light duty status, 
all employees must adhere to the following:  

1. Notify their Division Supervisor or Commander as soon as it becomes 
apparent that they are unable to perform their regularly-assigned duties, or 
meet the physical and mental requirements of the job at full capacity and 
in all cases before reporting to work. 

2. Submit to the Personnel Section an APD Physician's Report form listing 
all limitations (See Personnel Office). 

3. Continue to submit appropriate paperwork as directed by the Personnel 
Section and at a minimum make contact with Personnel every (4) four 
weeks, unless notified differently by that office. 

4. When given a light duty assignment contact the Division Commander to 
which they have been assigned so as to determine the reporting date and 
specific assignment.  The employee will also provide that Commander 
with a copy of the medical restrictions. 

5. Sworn employees assigned to light duty shall not drive marked or 
unmarked police vehicles and shall make arrangements to have their 
marked or unmarked vehicle returned to the station as soon as possible.  

  

6. Sworn employees on light duty will not contact a suspect for an 
interview without express authorization from their Captain and that contact 
is only done by telephone.  Sworn employees will not participate in making 
a physical arrest of a suspect.  

7. Business casual will be the dress code for light duty employees, unless

This policy is for internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

2.08.005  Work Place Safety (Interior) 

To help reduce workplace injuries and illness by informing employees about 
potential workplace hazards and office safety.  Preventing workplace injuries and 
illness benefits both the employee and the employer. 

That members of the Anchorage Police Department will practice and maintain 
standard safety practices while working in buildings and offices of the 
Municipality of Anchorage and specifically the Anchorage Police Department. 

Changes have occurred in the American workplace as a result of new office 
technology and the automation of office equipment.  As with all new technology, 
these changes bring with it a set of health and safety concerns.  In addition to 
obvious hazards such as slippery floors or an open file drawer, a modern office 
may also contain hazards related to lighting, noise, furniture design, or 
equipment and machines that emit gases and vapors when improperly 
maintained.  Even the nature of office work itself can produce a variety of aches, 
pains, and problems.  However, the leading types of disabling accidents in an 
office environment continue to be caused by falls, strains, over exertions or by 
impacts with objects. 

DEFINITIONS 

Interior:  Those areas within the confines of a building owned or maintained by 
the Municipality of Anchorage. 

Workspace:  The specific areas where an employee normally works at, or within 
a common area where employees work. 

I. GENERAL SAFETY INFORMATION AND INSTRUCTION 

PROCEDURE 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

  

A. Falls:  Falls are the most common office accident, accounting for the 
greatest number of disabling injuries.  The disabling injury rate of falls among 
office workers is 2 to 2.5 times higher than the rate for non-office employees.  
A fall occurs when you lose your balance and footing.  One of the most 
common causes of office falls is tripping over an open desk or file drawer.  
Bending while seated in an unstable chair or tripping over electrical cords or 
wires are another common hazard.  Office falls are frequently caused by 
using a chair or stack of boxes in place of a ladder or by slipping on wet 
floors.  Loose carpeting, objects stored in halls or walkways, and inadequate 
lighting are additional hazards that invite accidental falls.  Fortunately, all of 
these fall hazards are preventable.  The following checklist can help stop a 
fall before it happens: 

Be sure the pathway is clear before you walk.  

Close drawers completely after every use.  

Avoid excessive bending, twisting, and leaning backward while seated.  

Secure electrical cords and wires away from walkways.  

Always use a stepladder for overhead reaching. Chairs should never be 
used as ladders.  

Clean up spills immediately.  

Pick up objects co-workers may have left on the floor.  

Report loose carpeting or damaged flooring. 

Never carry anything that obscures your vision.  

Wear stable shoes with non-slip soles. 

If you find yourself heading for a fall, remember - roll, don‘t reach.  By letting 
your body crumple and roll, you are more likely to absorb the impact and 
momentum of a fall without injury.  Reaching an arm or leg out to break your 
fall may result in a broken limb instead. 

B. Strains and Over-Exertion:  Although a typical office job may not involve 
lifting large or especially heavy objects, it‘s important to follow the principles 
of safe lifting.  Small, light loads (i.e., stacks of files, boxes of computer paper, 
books) can wreak havoc on your back, neck, and shoulders if you use your 
body incorrectly when you lift them.  Backs are especially vulnerable; most 
back injuries result from improper lifting.  Before you pick up a carton or load, 
ask yourself these questions:  

Is this too heavy for me to lift and carry alone?  

How high do I have to lift it?  

How far do I have to carry it?  

Am I trying to impress anyone by lifting this?  

  

If you feel that the lift is beyond your ability, contact your supervisor or ask 
another employee to assist you. 

1. Safe Lifting Steps  

Take a balanced stance, feet placed shoulder-width apart.  When lifting 
something from the floor, squat close to the load.  

Keep your back in its neutral or straight position.  Tuck in you chin so 
your head and neck continue the straight back line.  

Grip the object with your whole hand, rather than only with your 
fingers.  Draw the object close to you, holding your elbows close to 
your body to keep the load and your body weight centered.  

Lift by straightening your legs.  Let your leg muscles, not your back 
muscles, do the work.  Tighten your stomach muscles to help support 
your back. Maintain your neutral back position as you lift.  

Never twist when lifting.  When you must turn with a load, turn your 
whole body, feet first.  

Never carry a load that blocks your vision.  

To set something down, use the same body mechanics designed for 
lifting. 

2. Lifting from a seated position 

Bending from a seated position and coming back up places 
tremendous strain on your back.  Your chair could be unstable and slip 
out from under you.  

Stand and move your chair out of the way. 

Squat and stand whenever you have to retrieve something from the 
floor. 

3. Ergonomic solutions to backbreaking tasks 

If you are doing a lot of twisting while lifting, try to rearrange the space to 
avoid this.  People who have to twist under a load are more likely to suffer 
back injury. 

Rotate through tasks so that periods of standing alternate with moving 
or sitting.  Ask for stools or footrests for stationary jobs.  

Store materials at knee level whenever possible instead of on the floor. 
Make shelves shallower (12-18") so one does not have to reach 
forward to lift the object.  Break up loads so each weighs less.  

If your must carry a heavy object some distance, consider storing it 
closer, request a table to rest it on, or try to use a hand truck or cart to 
transport it. 

C. Struck By or Striking Objects:  Incidents of this type include:  

  

Bumping into doors, desks, file cabinets, and open drawers.  

Bumping into other people while walking.  

Striking open file drawers while bending down or straightening up.  

Striking against sharp objects such as office machines, spindle files, 
staples, and pins.  

Pay attention to where you are walking at all times, properly store 
materials in your work area and never carry objects that prevent you from 
seeing ahead of you.  

Office supplies sliding from shelves or cabinet tops.  

Overbalanced file cabinets in which two or more drawers were opened 
at the same time or in which the file drawer was pulled out too far.  

Machines, such as typewriters, that were dropped on feet.  

Doors that were opened suddenly from the other side.  

Proper material storage and use of storage devices can avoid these 
accidents. 

D. Caught In or Between Objects:  The last category of leading disabling 
incidents occurs as a result of office workers who get their fingers or articles 
of clothing caught in or between objects.  Office workers may be injured as a 
result of:  

Fingers caught in a drawer, door, or window.  

Fingers, hair or articles of clothing and jewelry caught in office 
machines.  

Fingers caught under the knife-edge of a paper cutter.  

While working on office equipment, concentrate on what you are doing 
and avoid wearing clothing or accessories which may get caught in 
equipment. 

E. Material Storage:  Office materials that are improperly stored can lead to 
objects falling on workers, poor visibility, and can create a fire hazard.  A 
good housekeeping program will reduce or eliminate hazards associated with 
improper storage of materials.  

Examples of improper storage include: 

Disorderly piling, piling materials too high, and obstructing doors, aisles, fire 
exits and fire-fighting equipment.  

The following are good storage practices:  

Boxes, papers, and other materials should not be stored on top of lockers 
or file cabinets because they can cause landslide problems.  Boxes and 
cartons should all be of uniform size in any pile or stack.  Always stack 
material in such a way that it will not fall over.  

  

Store heavy objects on lower shelves.  

Try to store materials inside cabinets, files, and lockers.  

Office equipment such as typewriters, index files, lights or calculators 
should not be placed on the edges of a desk, filing cabinet, or table.  

Aisles, corners, and passageways must remain unobstructed.  There 
should be no stacking of materials in these areas.  

Storage areas should be designated and used only for that purpose.  
Store heavy materials so you do not have to reach across  anything to 
retrieve them.  

Fire equipment, extinguishers, fire door exits, and sprinkler heads should 
remain unobstructed.  Materials should be at least 18 inches away from 
sprinkler heads. 

II. WORKSTATION ERGONOMICS 

Ergonomics means fitting the workplace to the workers by modifying or 
redesigning the job, workstation, tool or environment.  Although many employees 
assume this means specific equipment is required in the workplace, in fact, the 
employee can take many steps to improve the work environment without buying 
new equipment. 

The key to comfort is in maintaining the body in a relaxed, neutral position.  The 
ideal work position is to have the arms hanging relaxed from the shoulders.  If a 
keyboard is used, arms should be bent at right angles at the elbow, with the 
hands held in a straight line with forearms and elbows close to the body.  The 
head should be in lined with the body and slightly forward.  

A. Arranging your workstation to fit you 

Adjust the height of the chair‘s seat such that the thighs are horizontal 
while the feet are flat on the floor.  

Adjust the seat pan depth such that your back is supported by the chair 
back rest while the back of the knee is comfortable relative to the front of 
the seat.  

Adjust the back rest vertically so that it supports/fits the curvature of your 
lower back.  

With the arms at your sides and the elbow joint approximately 90 degrees, 
adjust the height/position of the chair armrests to support the forearms.  

Adjust the height of the keyboard such that the fingers rest on the 
keyboard home row when the arm is to the side, elbow at 90 degrees, and 
the wrist straight.  

Place the mouse, trackball, or special keypads, next to the keyboard tray.  
Keep the wrist in a neutral position with the arm and hand close to the 
body.  

  

Adjust the height of the monitor such that the top of the screen is at eye 
level.  If bifocals/trifocals are used, place the monitor at a height that 
allows easy viewing without tipping the head back.  

Place reference documents on a document holder close to the screen and 
at the same distance from the eye.  

A footrest may be necessary if the operator cannot rest his/her feet 
comfortably on the floor.  

B. Applying good work practices 

The way a task is performed and the workstation environment it is performed 
in can influence the risk of injury and general work productivity.  Good 
technique can make a job easy and safe to accomplish.  Try:   

Adjusting the drapes or blinds  

Moving the monitor away from sources of glare or direct light 

Tipping the monitor slightly downward  

Using diffusers on overhead lighting  

Placing an anti-glare filter on the screen  

Clean the monitor screen on a regular basis  

Avoid cradling the telephone between the head and shoulder.  Hold the 
phone with your hand, use the speaker phone, or a headset  

Keep frequently used items like the telephone, reference materials, and 
pens/pencils within easy reach  

Position the monitor directly in front of the user  

Move between different postures regularly  

Apply task lighting as to your needs  

Use the minimum force necessary to strike the keyboard/ten-key keys  

Use the minimum force necessary to activate the hole punch and stapler  

Vary your tasks to avoid a long period of one activity  

Take mini-breaks to rest the eyes and muscles.  A break does not have to 
be a stop of work duties.  However, it should be a different style of 
physical activity such as changing from keyboarding to using the 
telephone or filing 

Neutralize distracting noise by using ear plugs, playing soft music, or 
turning on a fan  

Maintain a comfortable workplace temperature by using layers of clothing 
or a fan 

III. OFFICE ELECTRICAL SAFETY 

  

Electricity is essential to the operations of a modern automated office as a source 
of power.  Electrical equipment used in an office is potentially hazardous , can be 
the source of building fires, or can cause serious shock and burn injuries if 
improperly used or maintained. 

Electrical accidents usually occur as a result of faulty or defective equipment, 
unsafe installation, or misuse of equipment on the part of office workers.  

A. Ungrounded Equipment  

Grounding is a method of protecting employees from electric shock.  By 
grounding an electrical system, a low-resistance path to earth through a 
ground connection is intentionally created.  When properly done, this path 
offers sufficiently low resistance and has sufficient current-carrying capacity to 
prevent the build-up of hazardous voltages.  Most fixed equipment such as 
large, stationary machines must be grounded.  Cord and plug connected 
equipment must be grounded if it is located in hazardous or wet locations, if 
operated at more than 150 volts to ground, or if it is of a certain type of 
equipment (such as refrigerators and air conditioners).  Smaller office 
equipment, such as typewriters and coffee pots, would generally not fall into 
these categories and therefore would not have to be grounded.  However 
much of the newer office equipment is manufactured with grounded plugs as 
a precaution (three prong plugs).  

In such cases, the equipment should be used in accordance with the 
manufacturer‘s instructions.  In any case, never remove the third (grounding) 
prong from any three-prong piece of equipment.  

B. Overloaded Outlets  

Overloading of electrical outlets should be avoided.  A sufficient number of 
outlets will eliminate the need for extension cords.  Overloading electrical 
circuits and extension cords can result in a fire.  Floor mounted outlets should 
be carefully placed to prevent tripping hazards.  

C. Unsafe/Non-Approved Equipment  

The use of poorly maintained or unsafe, poor quality, non-approved (by 
national testing laboratory) coffee makers, radios, lamps, etc. (often provided 
by or used by employees) should be discarded.  Such appliances can 
develop electrical shorts creating fire and/or shock hazards.  Equipment and 
cords should be inspected regularly, and a qualified individual should make 
repairs.  

D. Defective, frayed or improperly installed cords for electrically-operated 
office equipment  

When the outer jacket of a cord is damaged, the cord may no longer be 
water-resistant.  The insulation can absorb moisture, which may then result in 
a short circuit or excessive current leakage to ground.  If wires are exposed, 
they may cause a shock to a worker who contacts them.  These cords should 

  

be replaced.  Electric cords should be examined on a routine basis for fraying 
and exposed wiring.  

E. Improper Placement of Cords  

A cord should not be pulled or dragged over nails, hooks, or other sharp 
objects that may cause cuts in the insulation.  In addition, cords should never 
be placed on radiators, steam pipes, walls, and windows.  Particular attention 
should be placed on connections behind furniture, since files and bookcases 
may be pushed tightly against electric outlets, severely bending the cord at 
the plug.  

F. Electrical Cords across Walkways and Work Areas  

An adequate number of outlet sockets should be provided.  Extension cords 
should only be used in situations where fixed wiring is not feasible.  However, 
if it is necessary to use an extension cord, never run it across walkways or 
aisles due to the potential tripping hazard.  If you must run a cord across a 
walkway, either tape it down or purchase a cord runner.  

G. Live Parts Unguarded  

Wall receptacles should be designed and installed so that no current-carrying 
parts will be exposed, and outlet plates should be kept tight to eliminate the 
possibility of shock.  

H. Pulling of Plugs to Shut Off Power  

Switches to turn on and off equipment should be provided, either in the 
equipment or in the cords, so that it is not necessary to pull the plugs to shut 
off the power.  To remove a plug from an outlet, take a firm grip on and pull 
the plug itself.  Never pull a plug out by the cord.  

I. Working on "Live Equipment"  

Disconnect electrical machines before cleaning, adjusting, or applying 
flammable solutions.  If a guard is removed to clean or repair parts, replace it 
before testing the equipment and returning the machine to service.  

J. Blocking Electrical Panel Doors  

If an electrical malfunction should occur, the panel door, and anything else in 
front of the door will become very hot.  Electrical panel doors should always 
be kept closed, to prevent "electrical flashover" in the event of an electrical 
malfunction.  

Common types of electrical hazards found in an office environment include heat-
producing equipment - copiers, work processors, coffee makers and hot plates - 
are often overlooked as a potential fire hazard.  Keep them away from anything 
that might burn.  

IV. OFFICE FIRE PREVENTION AND STRATEGIES 

The best time to think about fire safety is before a fire starts.  Learn the location 
of fire escape routes and how to activate the fire alarm.  Participate in practice 

  

fire drills on a regular basis.  Become familiar with stairway exits - elevators may 
not function during a fire, or may expose passengers to heat, gas and smoke. 

Electrical appliances can be fire hazards.  Be sure to turn off all appliances at 
the end of the day.  Use only grounded appliances plugged into grounded 
outlets (three prong plug).  

If electrical equipment malfunctions or gives off a strange odor, disconnect it 
and call the appropriate maintenance personnel.  Promptly disconnect and 
replace cracked, frayed, or broken electrical cords.  

Keep extension cords clear of doorways and other areas where they can be 
stepped on or chafed and never plug one extension cord into another.  

Do not allow combustible material (boxes, paper, etc.) to build up in 
inappropriate storage locations (near sources of ignition).  

Through a program of scheduled inspections, unsafe conditions can be 
recognized and corrected before they lead to serious injuries.  Take a few 
moments each day to walk through your work area.  Look for items previously 
pointed out, such as objects protruding into walkways, file cabinets that are 
weighted toward the top or frayed electrical cords.  Advise personnel in the 
area of the hazards and set about correcting them.

2.09.005 Early Intervention Program 
 

PURPOSE 

 
To inform all employees of the procedures involved with the Early Intervention 
Program (EIP) which was developed to ensure a successful and productive 
career for all. 
 

DISCUSSION 
 
Employees of the Anchorage Police Department are subject to the same causes 
of stress, problems, and difficulties as the public we serve. On occasion, these 
issues can affect an employee‘s behavior and/or performance at work. The EIP is 
designed to provide supervisory personnel with tools to help employees before 
the stress can affect the employee‘s performance or result in conduct that is 
contrary to the mission of the Department. The EIP is a supportive personnel 
management program committed to promoting employee success through the 
early identification of employees who demonstrate potential symptoms of job 
stress, training deficiencies, or personal problems that could affect job safety, job 
performance, or lead to disciplinary action or termination. 
 

POLICY 

 
If identified for the Early Intervention Program, various assistance strategies shall 
be tailored to address the specific issues affecting the employee. The EIP 
employs intervention strategies that are not punitive or disciplinary in nature. 
Early intervention is implemented through the employee‘s first line supervisor and 
may include counseling, training, and/or referral, based on the particular needs of 
the employee. 
 
It is the duty of all supervisors to continually monitor the performance and 
behavior of the personnel assigned to them. 
 
An employee‘s participation in the EIP will not be considered in any promotional 
process, employee transfers, or selection for or continued assignment to 
specialty units. 
 

 

  

There are three ways in which an employee may be referred for early 
intervention. The first is by recommendation of the employee‘s first line 
supervisor and subsequent approval of the employee‘s chain of command. The 
second is through either peer referral or self-referral. The third is by an alert 
triggered when the employee reaches a threshold in a selected performance 
category. 
 
Although no specific or universal criteria can determine job stress and/or job 
performance patterns, it is important that certain types of criteria be reviewed. 
Even though individual incidents may appear to be acceptable by themselves, a 
pattern of less than optimal job performance may be developing that can be 
difficult to identify. For example, a single use of force incident by an officer may 
be within policy, but a pattern of frequently resorting to force may be indicative of 
an officer who requires training in conflict resolution or on how to more effectively 
communicate. It may also be an indicator of stress or conflict in the officer‘s 
personal life. In the event that a pattern or trend appears to be developing in 
certain performance categories, alerts will be generated within Internal Affairs, 
thus identifying an employee as a potential candidate for the EIP. The 
employee‘s supervisor will be notified and will examine the employee‘s actions 
within the context of their work assignment and past performance in order to 
make a more accurate assessment of the situation. Command will periodically 
review the criteria that have been selected to generate alerts in order to assess 
their accuracy and improve the effectiveness of the program. An employee‘s 
participation in recommended intervention(s) may be voluntary or mandated. 
 

DEFINITIONS 

 
Confidentiality Admonishment:  A document stressing the importance of 
maintaining confidentiality and the potential consequences of failure to do so. 
 
Early Intervention Plan:  A strategy developed by an employee‘s first line 
supervisor and chain of command, with input from the employee, which is 
designed to assist the employee in a positive and supportive manner. 
 
Employee Assistance Program: A confidential, no-cost service provided by the 
Municipality of Anchorage to all employees and members of their household. 
Some areas of assistance include health and wellness; child and elder care; 
family and parenting issues; work/life balance; marital or relationship issues; pre- 
and post-natal concerns; grief, loss, depression anxiety, and stress; and alcohol 
or drug dependency issues. 
 
Threshold:  The point at which the maximum number of measured performance 
criteria is reached within a rolling 12-month period, resulting in an alert being 
generated, and that may indicate the need for early intervention. 
 
 

  

PROCEDURE 
 

A.  Candidates for Early Intervention.  The selection or identification of an 
employee for participation in the EIP can occur by 
 

1.  Having been recommended for participation in the program by the 

employee‘s first line supervisor (after consultation with and approval by 
the employee‘s chain of command), or 

2.   Is identified by a peer as possibly needing help or self identifying to the 

3.  Having been identified after an alert has been triggered upon reaching a 

supervisor as needing help, or  

threshold outlined in this policy. 

 
B.  Criteria, Thresholds, and Alerts.   The period of time during which selected 
criteria will be examined shall be a ―rolling‖ 12-month period. Within that time 
frame, the following areas of concern will be monitored and, should an alert be 
generated for excessive occurrences, employees will be identified for possible 
participation in the EIP: 
: 

1.  Complaints – 3 occurrences. External complaints received from the public, 

e.g., rude conduct. 

2.  Civil Litigation – 1 occurrence. Lawsuits filed against an employee alleging 

misconduct by the employee during the discharge of their duties. 

3.  Request For Action Forms (RFA) – 10 occurrences. Failure to complete or 

correct a police report. 

4.  Suspensions. 1 occurrence. Employees who receive discipline following 

an internal investigation that resulted in their suspension from duty for any 
period of time. 

5.  Traffic Collisions. 3 occurrences. Employees whose job duties include 
operation of a municipal vehicle who are involved in on-the-job traffic 
collisions. 

6.  Response to Resistance. 5 occurrences. The application of non-lethal 

force, identified through Blue Team entries. 

7.  Unexcused Tardiness- 3 occurrences.  Unexcused tardiness is 

documented in Blue Team. 

 
C.  Early Intervention Program Initiation Process. Alerts generated by Internal 
Affairs will be forwarded to a reviewer(s) designated by the Chief of Police. That 
reviewer will then: 
 

1.  Immediately log the alert into the Early Intervention Program Log; and 
2.  Notify the employee‘s first and second line supervisors by email; and 
3.  Follow up with the employee‘s first line supervisor within one week to 

ensure that the EIP has been initiated or that a determination was made 
that there was no need for intervention. 

 

  

D.  Supervisor and Command Responsibilities. Regardless of the method or 

reason for notification, once notified that an employee is a potential 
candidate for the EIP, the employee‘s first line supervisor shall 

1.  Review the alert to determine if it merits further investigation; and 
2.  Gather and review performance  information regarding the employee 

within 4 work days of receiving the alert; and 

3.  Schedule an initial meeting with the employee within 8 work days of 

receiving the alert to determine what factors may be contributing to the 
indicated performance issue(s); and 

4.  Prior to the initial meeting with the employee, consult with the employee‘s 
second line supervisor (or chain of command) to determine the proper 
course of action, to include strategies outlined in the Supervisor’s Guide. 
5.  If the alert does not have merit the supervisor will consult with the chain of 

command and note their findings in Blue Team. 

 
E.  Confidentiality Requirement and Admonishment.  Confidentiality is paramount 
to the success of the Early Intervention Program. As such, there are tight 
restrictions on the sharing of information revealed by an employee participating in 
early intervention. A violation of the Confidentiality Admonishment may be 
subject to an internal investigation and discipline, up to and including termination. 
During the initial meeting with the employee, the supervisor shall 
 

1.  Explain that the EIP is neither disciplinary nor punitive in nature; and 
2.  Offer the employee the presence of a shop steward; and 
3.  Review the elements of the Confidentiality Admonishment; and 
4.  Request the signature of both the employee and the shop steward. 

 
F.  Implementation and Termination of an Early Intervention Plan.  After an 
intervention plan has been developed and approved by the chain of command, 
the first line supervisor will meet again with the employee. During and after this 
meeting, the supervisor shall 
 

1.  Explain the details of the plan and answer any questions or concerns; and 
2.  Schedule regular follow-up meeting(s) as necessary to monitor the 

progress of the plan and document in Blue Team; and 

3.  Keep the chain of command apprised of the employee‘s progress or lack 

thereof; and 

4.  Upon completion of the intervention, make the appropriate notation 

(without details) in Blue Team. 

 
G.  Success or Failure of Early Intervention.  The EIP employs strategies that are 
not disciplinary in nature and that are separate and distinct from the complaint 
investigation and the disciplinary process. Although complaints may be 
considered in determining intervention strategies, this does not imply that these 
complaints have been or will be sustained. However, should intervention fail to 

 

  

remedy the performance issues identified as areas of concern, discipline may be 
the end result considered under a separate process for the performance 
deficiencies and not for lack of participation in the EIP program.

To advise all personnel of their responsibilities in calls for service involving 
animals. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

DEFINITIONS 

The Anchorage Police Department, when resources permit, resolve complaints 
and situations involving animals with the objective of restoration of public peace 
and safety, while being mindful of humane treatment of animals. 

Officers may be exposed to a remarkably wide range of calls involving animals, 
be it barking dogs, wandering moose and bear, a hostile animal keeping medics 
at bay, animal abuse and/or neglect or an actual death from an animal attack.  
Citizens understandably want protection and assistance with these incidents, but 
want that service delivered humanely. 

Domestic Animals and Exotic Pets:  Those animals generally regarded as pets 
and not indigenous to the area.  This would include dogs, cats, various birds, 
snakes, and similar animals. 

Farm Animals:  Those animals generally regarded as having commercial value 
other than sale as pets. 

  

Wildlife:  Animals indigenous to the state, whether in the wild or in captivity. 

PROCEDURE 

I. AGENCIES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. State and Municipal Agencies.  In nearly all events, patrol officers will work 
in conjunction with either of the following two agencies: 

1. Alaska Department of Public Safety, Division of Fish and Wildlife 
Protection, which has the primary responsibility for enforcing the various 
laws governing fishing, hunting, trapping and other such activities as it 
pertains to wildlife.  Alaska Division of Fish and Game will be considered 
the primary contact agency for all wildlife questions and concerns.  
Contact can be made the appropriate personnel through APD dispatch. 

2. Anchorage Animal Care and Control Center, which has fundamental 
responsibility for all animal situations within the Municipality of Anchorage 
when the subject animal(s) is (are) domestic, exotic, or farm.  The 
Anchorage Police Department will, when resources permit, process 
criminally prosecutable cases. 

II. ANCHORAGE POLICE DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Primary Responsibility. The fundamental role of the Anchorage Police 
Department is to preserve the peace and to protect the public.  Situations 
involving animals require independent evaluation, but the following is offered 
to assist in the most common situations: 

1. Anchorage Police may be dispatched as an initial responder:  Officers 
routinely find themselves as the first unit at a scene, even when resolution 
of the complaint may not be a police responsibility.  Public expectation, 
however, is that the officer will take action.  The following is offered to help 
guide officers in these situations. 

a). Non-Urgent problems.  If public safety is not urgently imperiled, 
officers shall not be dispatched.  Notification may be made to the 
appropriate agency.  In the event an officer happens upon such a non-
urgent situation, discretion should be used prior to taking action. 

b). Urgent problems.  When public safety is significantly compromised, 
officers must take action.  This action can only be based on the 
immediate circumstance. 

2. Outside Agency Assist.  The Department will, when resources permit, 
provide outside agencies with whatever reasonable assistance is 
requested.  This may include: 

a). Providing traffic control when appropriate. 

b). Accompanying an Animal Control Officer to contact an 
owner/defendant in an animal complaint (as in a Civil Standby) if 
requested. 

  

B. Destruction of Animals.  Occasionally, officers are confronted with 
situations where humane treatment and/or public safety require the 
destruction of an animal.  The following guidelines shall apply: 

1. Standards.  Destruction of an animal is a last resort response, and will 
not be considered unless the following conditions are met: 

a).There is an urgent and immediate threat to public safety; or 

b). The animal is suffering extreme pain and/or injury; and, in either 
event: 

i. There is no person (e.g. owner) or agency (i.e. Fish and Wildlife 
Protection if wildlife is involved, or the Municipal Animal Control 
Officer for other animals) willing or able to respond in a timely 
fashion; and 

ii. The method of destruction will not create a significant hazard to 
any person or property.  If destruction is required, the following 
procedure will apply: 

1). Notify the Field Supervisor to confirm authority. 

2). A handgun will not be used on any animal larger than a small 
dog, except in extreme circumstances. 

C. Disposal of Remains.  Officers are reminded that Federal and State laws 
govern the disposition of certain animal carcasses and the appropriate 
agency should be contacted for guidance in the disposal process.  Samplings 
of these laws include: 

1. Not retaining pelts of furbearing animals, since it could be construed as 
benefiting from office. 

2. Not possessing any part of an eagle. 

3. Notification of the proper person(s) through APD Dispatch from the 
Charitable Organization list maintained by the Alaska State Troopers for 
moose kills. 

D. Notification of Owner.  Whenever possible, officers shall make a 
reasonable attempt to notify the owner of an animal, if known, that the animal 
has been injured, killed, or disposed of. 

E. Impoundment of Animal.  During some situations it may become necessary 
to seize or impound an animal while performing normal police duties.  Every 
effort shall be made to contact the animal‘s owner or other responsible party 
to take custody of the animal.  If these efforts fail, APD Dispatch will make 
contact with the Anchorage Animal Care and Control Center to respond and 
take custody of the animal.  If it is after hours the Officer may be required to 
personally transport the animal to Animal Care and Control to be where the 
animal can be secured.  

F. Enforcement 

  

1. Criminal charges such as animal cruelty are generally handled by an 
APD Officer with assistance from an Animal Care and Control Officer.  
Under the current contract, Animal Care and Control Officers cannot 
enforce Animal Cruelty laws but are able to assist APD Officers in the 
investigation of complaints. 

2. APD officers shall, when resources permit, investigate and enforce 
animal related offenses under AMC 8.55 and AS 11.61.140.  These 
include, but are not limited to: animal abuse, neglect or fighting. 

3. Animal Care and Control Officers generally have the primary 
responsibility to enforce AMC 17.

3.01.010  Death Investigations 

To instruct all members on the procedures regarding investigation of all non-
traffic related deaths.  (For fatal traffic accidents, refer to procedure Traffic 
Accident – Fatal Injury). 

That all deaths, except expected home deaths, be investigated as homicides until 
or unless evidence concludes otherwise. 

Deceased Person:  The physical remains of a human who has either been 
pronounced dead by a licensed physician or paramedic, or is noted to bear 
unmistakable evidence of death. 

Expected Home Deaths:  The death of a person suffering from a terminal illness.  
Procedures are established by the family, through the attending physician, with 
the Coroner‘s Office prior to death to allow the terminally ill person to die at 
home. (Formerly No-Code Deaths) 

Natural Death:  Death which occurs through the progression of natural 
pathological processes. 

Accidental Death:  Death which results from an unexpected and unintentional 
event. 

Suicide:  Death which results from a person intentionally killing him or her self, 
and is not aided or assisted by another. 

Homicide.  Death which results from one person killing another person. 

Unmistakable Evidence of Death:  Bodily evidence which makes death clear and 
obvious.  This evidence includes decapitation, rigor mortis, postmortem lividity, 
and decomposition and putrefaction.  

  

Dying Declaration:  A statement made by a victim who believes they are about to 
die in reference to the manner in which he/she received the injuries of which 
he/she is dying, or other immediate cause of his/her death, and in reference to 
the person who inflicted such injuries or the connection with such injuries of a 
person who is charged or suspected of having committed them.  The victim must 
die or must be unable to testify and must have been otherwise competent and 
rational at the time of the statement. 

Cause, Manner, and Mechanism of Death:  A legal method of describing the total 
circumstances of a death.  Specifically: 

Cause is the injury or disease which begins the process which leads to death. 

Manner is those circumstances under which death occurred.  There are five 
manners of death; natural, accidental, homicide, suicide, or undetermined. 

Mechanism is the physical or biochemical derangement which was set into 
motion by the cause of death. 

An example of this classification would be: 

Cause of Death:  Gunshot wound to the head 
Manner of Death:  Homicide 
Mechanism of Death:  Massive brain injury

DISCUSSION 

Except for hospital deaths from natural causes or expected home deaths, any 
death occurring within the Anchorage Police Service area becomes the 
responsibility of the Anchorage Police Department to investigate.  This 
investigation is to collect evidence regarding the cause, manner, and mechanism 
of death, and, if the manner is criminal, to identify, apprehend the person(s) 
responsible and provide evidence to the court regarding culpability. 

There are four distinct manners of death:  natural, accidental, suicide, and 
homicide.  Additionally, there is a fifth category which cannot be readily classified 
within one of the four distinct manners of death due to lack of information and/or 
unknown circumstances.  This will be initially classified as ―Death--Undetermined 
Cause.‖  All deaths responded to shall be regarded as potential homicides.  This 
should also include any rescue assist call where death is imminent or likely to 
result, even though the victim is transported to a medical facility. 

All deaths should be investigated not only to prove a specific manner, like 
homicide, but also to eliminate the other manners.  Further, the investigation 

  

should not stop if criminal culpability is eliminated, as the Department still carries 
the obligation to investigate cause, manner, and mechanism of death for other 
than criminal purposes, including public health civil litigation and insurance 
concerns. 

I. EXPECTED HOME DEATHS 

PROCEDURE 

A. Emergency Communications Center Responsibilities.  The Anchorage Fire 
Department, by agreement with the Anchorage Police Department, shall 
maintain a file of all Expected Home Deaths within the Municipality of 
Anchorage. 

1. The Communications Center can expect to be notified of an expected 
home death by electronic mail or by facsimile transmission. 

2. Once an expected death has been reported, no other action by the 
Anchorage Police Department shall be necessary unless an officer‘s 
presence is requested by a person at the scene because of suspicious or 
unusual circumstances, in which case an officer shall be dispatched 
immediately. 

3. A Department Report Number will not be required unless an officer 
responds to the scene and later requests such number. 

4. If the Anchorage Fire Department advises that no physician‘s form was 
on file at the time of death, an officer shall be dispatched to conduct a 
death investigation. 

B. Officer Responsibilities.  If dispatched to an Expected Home Death 
because of suspicious or unusual circumstances, the responding officer shall 
determine the need for further investigation. 

1. Should the responding officer feel that suspicious or unusual 
circumstances exist, that officer shall contact a supervisor to discuss the 
possibility of a full death investigation. 

2. The supervisor shall decide if the Division Commander should be 
notified, who may then call out the Homicide Unit. 

3. If a death investigation is conducted, the investigating officer shall 
request a copy of the physician‘s form, if on file, from the Emergency 
Communications Center or the Anchorage Fire Department and attach it 
to the police report.  If a physician‘s form was not on file, that fact shall be 
noted in the report. 

C. ―Comfort One‖ Deaths.  Officers and dispatchers should be aware of 
another level of the Expected Home Death program.  Comfort One allows 
terminally ill patients who are mobile and can leave their residence to wear a 
bracelet or carry a card or form which instructs medical personnel not to 
resuscitate them in the event of a non-breathing, non-responsive emergency.  
Officers may initially be sent to a scene involving a ―man down‖ or a non-

  

responsive person.  Until it is determined that the person is in fact a Comfort 
One patient, normal rescue procedures should be followed. 

II. HOMICIDES 

A. Dispatch.  Recognize that many homicides are originally dispatched as 
something else--a disturbance, shooting, or a simple ―welfare check.‖ 

B. Responding Officer‘s Responsibilities--General.  The responding officer 
has several duties to perform in the relatively brief period from dispatch to the 
arrival of the Homicide Investigators who assume responsibility of the case.  
In the simplest terms, the responding officer: 

1. Protects/preserves life; 

2. Assesses and stabilizes the scene; 

3. Protects/preserves the scene; 

4. Identifies witnesses; 

5. Identifies and detains suspects; 

6. Supervisor notification. 

C. Responding Officer‘s Responsibilities--Specific.  What follows are 
guidelines in the processing of a homicide case.  It is important to note that 
the circumstances confronting officers to a large degree dictate the order in 
which these duties are performed, and that these activities can often be 
delegated and accomplished simultaneously. 

1. Preservation of life.  Protection of life supersedes a police investigation.  

a). If the slightest possibility of life/revival exists, officers shall give 
medical personnel great latitude in the delivery of medical services.  
This includes entry into the crime scene, moving evidence if 
necessary, and removal of the victim for medical treatment.  
Consequently, officers shall adjust the investigation to accommodate 
this activity by the following:  

i. Attempt to photograph the victim while being attended to by 
medical personnel.  

ii. Note body position as accurately as practical prior to intervention 
by the paramedics.  

iii. Attempt to photograph and/or mark location of physical evidence 
likely to be disturbed by the actions of the paramedics.  

iv. Should a victim be transported, make all reasonable effort to 
coordinate with associated personnel to ensure an officer 
accompanies that victim to process possible dying declarations, 
clothing seizure, evidence seizures, and the like.  Note that the 
scene should be secured immediately after the victim‘s departure.  

-OR-  

  

b). If officers detect unmistakable evidence of death, they shall exclude 
all unauthorized and/or unnecessary persons from entry into the 
scene.  One (1) Paramedic may be allowed access to the victim with 
an officer to confirm death, if necessary. 

Note especially the following:  

i. All unnecessary traffic, including police not directly involved in the 
crime scene investigation, shall be excluded.  Maintain a ―Crime 
Scene Entry Log‖.  Traffic through the scene shall be strictly 
minimized, and any such traffic entered completely in the log.  

ii. Officers shall describe their observations to the medics to assure 
them that the victim is, in fact, deceased.  

2. Isolate and protect the scene.  Be extremely ―evidence conscious‖.  

3. Assess the Circumstances.  Officers should be concerned with 
determining if a crime has been committed, who the witnesses are, and 
who is suspect.  This information is gained by:  

a). Personal observations. 

b). General questioning of all persons present.  

i. This questioning is to acquire sufficient information to permit 
officers to make informed decisions on how to proceed (stabilize 
any remaining dangers, identify and locate people involved, and 
other such urgent concerns).  

ii. General questioning is distinguished from formal interviews, 
statements, and custodial interrogation of suspect(s).  It is normally 
a brief discussion of urgent matters.  

4. Witnesses.  Should the initial investigation establish witnesses, those 
witnesses should be transported separately to the Police Station to allow 
comprehensive interviewing in a managed environment.  

5. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.   

6. Vacate and secure the scene.  Once all persons have been removed 
from the crime scene, and the victim has either been confirmed deceased 
or transported for medical treatment, then all officers shall:  

a). Vacate and secure the immediate scene; and  

b). Await the arrival of the Homicide Investigators and the Crime Scene 
Investigation Team. 

7. Attempt to establish who has legal ownership/right of occupancy or 
legal control of the premises or of the crime scene, if the incident occurred 
within a structure.  Any information gleaned shall be forwarded to the 
Homicide Investigators.  They will take measures to ensure proper search 
and seizure requirements are met. 

  

8. Brief the Homicide Investigator(s).  This shall include witness 
statements from the scene, the result of the initial investigation, etc. 

9. Homicide investigators will do taped interviews with first responding 
officers.  This interview will serve as the officer‘s narrative report, but the 
officers may be required to complete a face sheet and additional names 
reports.  

D. Patrol Supervisors' Responsibilities.  The Patrol Supervisor shall: 

1. Ensure the following notifications are made: 

a). Shift Commander; 

b). Dispatch Center Supervisor; 

c). Captain of Investigations. 

2. Assist the responding unit as applicable. 

E. Dispatch Center‘s Responsibilities.  Upon notification of a suspicious 
death, Dispatch Center shall follow existing Unit Procedures for subsequent 
notifications.  Notify the Homicide Unit supervisor first to facilitate proper 
resources and personnel activation. 

F. Homicide Unit Supervisors' Responsibilities.  Upon learning of a suspicious 
death, the Homicide Unit Supervisor shall: 

1. Notify the division Lieutenant; 

2. Determine if the Homicide Investigation Unit should be dispatched; 

3. Determine if notification should be made to the Medical Examiner 
and/or District Attorney; 

4. Make any appropriate case assignments; 

5. Provide all authorized releases of information to the PICRU for release 
of information to members of the media; 

6. Next of kin notification. 

G. Homicide Unit‘s Responsibilities.  On arrival, the following shall apply: 

1. Assume responsibility for all aspects of the investigation; 

2. Confer with the on-scene Supervisor and initial investigating officer to 
establish case status; 

3. Provide for the dissemination of information, for example, but not limited 
to suspect information, possible witnesses, vehicles, and other evidence.  
This information shall be given to all assigned investigators and assisting 
patrol units. 

A. Dispatch.  Suicides are normally dispatched Code Three.  Although 
dispatched as a suicide, officers should be alert to two possibilities: 

III. SUICIDES 

  

1. That the attempt might be unsuccessful and rescue possible; or 

2. That the injuries might not be self-inflicted.  Always approach such 
incidents with an open mind for other criminal aspects. 

B. Responding Officers' Responsibilities--General.  Responding officers 
should approach a reported suicide similarly to a homicide.  The general 
responsibilities are: 

1. Protect/preserve life; 

2. Assess and stabilize the scene; 

3. Protect/preserve the scene; 

4. Identify witnesses; 

5. Supervisor notification. 

C. Responding Officers' Responsibilities--Specific.  All death investigations 
shall be initially approached as homicide cases until the facts prove 
differently.  The resolution of the manner of death as suicide is based on a 
series of factors which eliminate the other manners--homicide, accidental, 
and natural deaths. 

1. Officers should be aware of three basic considerations that may 
establish that the death was a suicide, namely: 

a). The presence of the weapon or means of death at the scene.  The 
absence of a weapon does not necessarily rule out suicide as the 
mode --the weapon could have been removed by others. 

b). Injuries that are obviously self-inflicted, or could have been self-
inflicted. 

c). The existence of a motive or intent to commit suicide. 

i. Crime scene investigation may indicate presence of life-
threatening behavior. 

ii. Background inquiry may indicate activities which suggest suicidal 
intent. 

2. Maintain a Crime Scene Entry Log.  Traffic should be strictly minimized, 
but any traffic through the scene should be accurately logged. 

3. Conduct recorded interviews with all witnesses.  Attempt to determine 
the victim's state of mind and previous behavior. 

4. If possible, provide next of kin information to the shift supervisor or 
Medical Examiner, if no family members are present. 

5. Ensure that the following notifications are made: 

a). Patrol Supervisor; 

b). Medical Examiner's Office.  The Medical Examiner‘s office will 
decide the disposition of the deceased 

  

6. Be alert to questionable circumstances.  Should any such 
circumstances come to the attention of officers, they shall notify a 
Supervisor who will, in turn, determine if the Homicide Unit Supervisor 
should be notified. 

7. Officers shall: 

a). Photograph the Scene; 

b). Complete a Police Report; and 

c). Complete a Death Investigation Report:  One copy of the Death 
Investigation Report shall accompany the deceased to the Medical 
Examiner's office or be forwarded to the Medical Examiner‘s Office if 
the body is released. 

8. If the victim lived alone in a residence, that residence shall be locked 
and secured when the investigation has concluded. 

D. Patrol Supervisors' Responsibilities.  The Patrol Supervisor shall: 

1. Ensure the next of kin is notified; 

2. Assist the responding unit as applicable. 

IV. NATURAL DEATHS 

A. Dispatch.  Recognize that a natural death can originally be dispatched as a 
"rescue assist" or other type of call.  The code may vary accordingly. 

B. Officers' Responsibilities--General.  Responding officers should approach a 
natural death similarly to a homicide.  The general responsibilities are: 

1. Protect/preserve life; 

2. Assess and stabilize the scene; 

3. Protect/preserve scene; 

4. Identify witnesses; 

5. Supervisor notification. 

C. Officers' Responsibilities--Specific.  The resolution of the mode of death as 
being the result of natural disease processes is based on factors which 
eliminate homicide, suicide, and accident as the cause of death. 

1. Be aware that the pathological condition which produced the death 
often is not readily apparent.  Consequently, autopsy results may be 
needed to determine the actual cause of death. 

2. Conduct interviews with witnesses, family members, medical personnel, 
and other appropriate people.  Attempt to determine any previous medical 
history or complaints. 

3. If possible, provide next of kin information to the shift supervisor or 
Medical Examiner, if no family members are present. 

  

4. Ensure the following notifications are made: 

a). Patrol Supervisor; 

b). Medical Examiner's Office.  The Medical Examiner‘s office will 
decide the disposition of the deceased 

4. Be alert to questionable circumstances.  A Supervisor shall be notified, 
should information come to the attention of officers casting doubt on the 
mode of death.  That Supervisor shall decide if the Homicide Unit 
Supervisor should be notified. 

5. Officers shall: 

a). Photograph the Scene; 

b). Complete a Police Report; and 

c). Complete a Death Investigation Report:  One copy of the Death 
Investigation Report shall accompany the deceased to the Medical 
Examiner's office or be forwarded to the Medical Examiner‘s Office if 
the body is released. 

5. If the victim lived alone in a residence, that residence shall be locked 
and secured when the investigation has concluded. 

D. Patrol Supervisors' Responsibilities.  The Patrol Supervisor shall: 

1. Ensure the next of kin is notified; 

2. Assist the responding unit as applicable. 

V. ACCIDENTAL DEATHS 

A. Dispatch.  Recognize that the dispatch for an accidental death can range 
from rescue assists, to overdoses, industrial accidents, and more.  Fatal 
automobile accidents are "accidental deaths," but are processed as described 
in the procedure "Traffic--Injury and Fatal Accidents". 

B. Officers' Responsibilities--General.  Responding officers should approach 
an accidental death similarly to a homicide.  The general responsibilities are: 

1. Protect/preserve life; 

2. Assess and stabilize the scene; 

3. Protect/preserve the scene; 

4. Identify witnesses; 

5. Supervisor notification. 

C. Officers' Responsibilities--Specific.  The resolution of the mode of death as 
being the result of an "accident" (an unexpected and unintentional event) is 
based on factors which eliminate homicide, suicide, and natural disease 
processes as the cause of death. 

  

1. Note that criminal charges may still result from an accidental death 
(criminal negligence). 

a). A proper investigation includes awareness of possible contributing 
circumstances.  This could include unsafe working conditions or 
dangerous acts of others. 

b). Interviews should be conducted with witnesses and/or other 
appropriate persons (co-workers, family members). 

c). Should any questionable circumstances arise, or if the filing of 
criminal charges appears possible, notify a Supervisor.  That 
Supervisor shall decide if the Homicide Unit Supervisor should be 
notified. 

2. Autopsies are generally needed to conclude the actual cause of death. 

3. If possible, provide next of kin information to the shift supervisor or 
Medical Examiner, if no family members are present. 

4. Ensure the following notifications are made: 

a). Patrol Supervisor; 

b). Medical Examiner's Office. The Medical Examiner‘s office will 
decide the disposition of the deceased 

5. Assist outside agencies with investigation if needed. 

6. Assist the Medical Examiner's Office in securing the victim's residence if 
the victim lived alone. 

7. Officers shall: 

a). Photograph the Scene; 

b). Complete a Police Report; and 

c). Complete a Death Investigation Report:  One copy of the Death 
Investigation Report shall accompany the deceased to the Medical 
Examiner's office or be forwarded to the Medical Examiner‘s Office if 
the body is released. 

D. Patrol Supervisors' Responsibilities.  The Patrol Supervisor shall: 

1. Ensure the following notifications are made: 

a). Next of kin notification. 

b). The Patrol Supervisor shall notify, cause to be notified, or verify that 
notification has been made to next of kin and to any appropriate agency.  
Depending on the nature of the accidental death, such notification could 
include: 

i. FAA and NTSB if an aircraft crash 

ii. OSHA (Federal) and Department of Labor Occupational Safety and 
Health (State) if an industrial accident 

  

iii. Municipal Fire Investigator if a fire death 

c). The Patrol Supervisor shall notify the homicide unit (e-mail group) via 
e-mail of notification status.  If notification has not been made and the duty 
is handed to another supervisor, the name of that supervisor will be 
included in the notification.  The second supervisor and any subsequent 
supervisor shall also notify the homicide (e-mail group) vial e-mail of the 
notification status, until notification has been made (final e-mail 
notification) or the duty has been given over to the homicide unit 
supervisor.

3.01.015  Death Investigation- Child Deaths 

To instruct all members on the procedures regarding investigation of all non-
traffic related child death investigations in which the death may have occurred 
through some form of child abuse.   

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

That all deaths of children under the age of 18 years, except expected home or 
hospital deaths, be investigated as homicides until or unless evidence causes the 
investigator to conclude otherwise. 

Investigation of the deaths of children under 18 years which may be due to child 
abuse shall be the responsibility of the Crimes Against Children Investigation 
Unit.  

Investigation of the deaths of children due to overt acts of violence such as 
gunshot victims shall be the responsibility of the Homicide Investigation Unit. 
(Refer to procedure - Death Investigation/General Order 98-2) 

Investigation of child traffic fatalities shall be the responsibility of the Traffic 
Accident Investigations Unit. (Refer to procedure Traffic Accident – Fatal Injury). 

DISCUSSION 

The death of a child is one of the most traumatic events a family and a 
community can experience.  This type of death always evokes strong emotions in 
family members, community members, first responders and medical personnel.  
As such it is important that Anchorage Police personnel conduct their 
investigation carefully and tactfully so as not to exacerbate the already 
emotionally charged situation.  Unfortunately, in the unexpected death of a child, 
the evidence as to what caused the death is often subtle or not immediately 
apparent even to the most seasoned investigator.  As with all homicides, except 
for hospital deaths from natural causes or expected home deaths, any death of a 
child occurring within the Anchorage Police Service area becomes the 

  

responsibility of the Anchorage Police Department to investigate.  This 
investigation is to collect evidence regarding the cause, manner, and mechanism 
of death, and, if the manner is criminal, to identify, apprehend the person(s) 
responsible and provide evidence to the court regarding culpability. 

There are four distinct manners of death: natural, accidental, suicide, and 
homicide.  Additionally, there is a fifth category, which cannot be readily 
classified within one of the four distinct manners of death due to lack of 
information and/or unknown circumstances.  This will be initially classified as 
―Death--Undetermined Cause‖.  All deaths to which APD responds shall be 
regarded as potential homicides.  This should also include any rescue assist call 
where death is imminent or likely to result, even though the victim is transported 
to a medical facility. 

All child deaths should be investigated not only to prove a specific manner, like 
homicide, but also to eliminate the other manners.  Further, the investigation 
should not stop if criminal culpability is eliminated, as the Department still carries 
the obligation to investigate cause, manner, and mechanism of death for other 
than criminal purposes, including civil litigation and insurance concerns. 

DEFINITIONS 

Deceased Person:  The physical remains of a human who has either been 
pronounced dead by a licensed physician or paramedic, or is noted to bare 
unmistakable evidence of death. 

Child Death:  The death of a child under the age of 18 years which resulted from 
physical abuse and/or neglect. 

Expected Home Deaths:  Death of a person suffering from a terminal illness.  
Procedures are established by the family, through the attending physician, with 
the Coroner‘s Office prior to death to allow the terminally ill person to die at 
home. (Formerly No-Code Deaths) 

Impending Death:  Physical condition in a child such that death may be imminent. 

Natural Death:  Death which occurs through the progression of natural disease 
processes. 

Accidental Death:  Death which results from an unexpected and unintentional 
event. 

Homicide:  Death which results from one person killing another person. 

Unmistakable Evidence of Death:  Bodily evidence which makes death clear and 
obvious.  This evidence includes decapitation, rigor mortis, postmortem lividity, 
and decomposition and putrefaction.  

Dying Declaration:  A statement made by a victim who believes they are about to 
die in reference to the manner in which he/she received the injuries of which 
he/she is dying, or other immediate cause of his/her death, and in reference to 
the person who inflicted such injuries or the connection with such injuries of a 
person who is charged or suspected of having committed them.  The victim must 

  

die or must be unable to testify and must have been otherwise competent and 
rational at the time of the statement. 

Cause, Manner, and Mechanism of Death:  A legal method of describing the total 
circumstances of a death. Specifically: 

Cause is the injury or disease which begins the process which leads to death. 

Manner is that circumstance under which death occurred.  There are five 
manners of death; natural, accidental, homicide, suicide, or undetermined. 

Mechanism is the physical or biochemical derangement which was set into 
motion by the cause of death.   

An example of this classification would be: 

Cause of Death:  Violent shaking of an infant. 

Manner of Death:  Homicide.  

Mechanism of Death:  Brain swelling (cerebral edema).

PROCEDURES 

I. EXPECTED HOME DEATHS:  Procedures are the same as detailed in Death 
Investigation/General order 98-2 Procedures 1-3.  

II. HOMICIDES  

Note: Usually the manner of death in a child death is not immediately evident.  It 
should be approached as a homicide recognizing that it may be due to other 
causes such as SIDS or meningitis.  

A. Dispatch.  Recognize that many child homicides are originally dispatched 
as something else--a baby not breathing, a medic assist for a fall, or a simple 
―welfare check.‖  Often children are transported to a medical facility by a 
caregiver after sustaining injuries which result in their deaths. 

B. Officer‘s Responsibilities--General.  The responding officer has several 
duties to perform in the relatively brief period from dispatch to the arrival of 
the Crimes Against Children Investigators who assume responsibility of the 
case.  In the simplest terms, the responding officer: 

1. Protects/preserves life. 

  

2. Assesses and stabilizes the scene. 

3. Protects/preserves the scene.  

4. Identifies witnesses. 

5. Identifies and detains suspects. 

6. Supervisor notification. 

C. Officer‘s Responsibilities--Specific.  What follows are guidelines in the 
processing of a potential child homicide case.  It is important to note that the 
circumstances confronting officers to a large degree dictate the order in which 
these duties are performed, and that these activities can often be delegated 
and accomplished simultaneously. 

1. Preservation of life.  Protection of life supersedes a police investigation.  

a). If the slightest possibility of life/revival exists, officers shall give 
medical personnel great latitude in the delivery of medical services.  
This includes entry into the crime scene, moving evidence if 
necessary, and removal of the victim for medical treatment.  
Consequently, officers shall adjust the investigation to accommodate 
this activity by the following:  

i. Attempt to photograph the victim while being attended to by 
medical personnel.  

ii. Note body position as accurately as practical prior to intervention 
by the paramedics.  

Iii. Attempt to photograph and/or mark location of physical evidence 
likely to be disturbed by the actions of the paramedics.  

iv. Be alert and document by recording and in a police report any 
explanations of the mechanism of injury given by caregivers and 
information about the caregivers just prior to and at the time of the 
onset of symptoms or time of discovery of the injured or dead child 
given. 

v. Should a victim be transported, make all reasonable effort to 
coordinate with associated personnel to ensure an officer 
accompanies that victim to process possible dying declarations of 
older children, clothing seizure, evidence seizures, and caretaker 
statements.  Note that the scene should be secured immediately 
after the victim‘s departure.  

b). If officers and/or paramedics detect the unmistakable evidence of 
death, Anchorage Fire Department medics will not transport the victim 
and the officer is responsible to assure a continued police presence 
with the victim until the removal of the body takes place.  The officer 
shall exclude all unauthorized and/or unnecessary persons from entry 

-OR-  

  

into the scene, being sensitive to the fact that grieving family members 
may have access to the remains of the child as long as a police officer 
or police chaplain is present to assure that the remains and scene are 
not altered in any way.  In any event the officer must assure that the 
remains and the scene are not changed until the arrival of investigating 
detectives.  

Note especially the following:  

All unnecessary traffic, including police not directly involved in the crime scene 
investigation, shall be excluded.  Maintain a ―Crime Scene Entry Log.‖  Traffic 
through the scene shall be strictly minimized, and any such traffic entered 
completely in the log.  

2. Isolate and protect the scene.  Be extremely ―evidence conscious.‖  
Encourage family members to go to another location after the body has 
been removed.  If the body remains at the scene, it can be released to the 
medical examiner or to a funeral home with the medical examiner‘s 
consent. 

3. Assess the Circumstances.  Officers should be concerned with 
determining if a crime has been committed, who the witnesses are, and 
who is suspect.  This information is gained by:  

a). Personal observations. 

b). General questioning of all persons present.  

i. This questioning is to acquire sufficient information to permit 
officers to make informed decisions on how to proceed (stabilize 
any remaining dangers, identify and locate people involved, and 
other such urgent concerns).  

ii. General questioning is distinguished from formal interviews, 
statements, and custodial interrogation of suspect(s). It is normally 
a brief discussion of urgent matters.  General questioning should, if 
at all possible, be recorded. 

4. Witnesses.  Investigating detectives might request the transportation of 
any witnesses to the Police Station for interviewing.  In these cases, 
witnesses should be transported separately to the Police Station to allow 
comprehensive interviewing in a managed environment.  

5. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.   

6. Scene.  Once all persons have left the crime scene, and the victim has 
either been confirmed deceased and transported by the Medical Examiner 
or transported for medical treatment, then all officers shall:  

a). Isolate and secure the immediate scene; and  

b). Await the arrival of the Crimes Against Children Investigators. 

  

c). Attempt to establish who has legal ownership/right of occupancy or 
legal control of the premises or of the crime scene, if the incident 
occurred within a structure.  Any information gleaned shall be 
forwarded to the Crimes Against Children Investigators.  They will take 
measures to ensure proper search and seizure requirements are met. 

d). Brief the Crimes Against Children Investigator(s).  This shall include 
witness statements from the scene, the result of the initial 
investigation, etc. 

e). Crimes Against Children Investigators will do recorded interviews 
with first responding officers.  This interview will serve as the officer‘s 
narrative report, but the officers may be required to complete a face 
sheet and additional names reports.  

7. Patrol Supervisors' Responsibilities. The Patrol Supervisor shall: 

a). Ensure the following notifications are made: 

i. Shift Commander; 

ii. Dispatch Center Supervisor; 

iii. Captain of Investigations; 

iv. Crimes Against Children Supervisor through dispatch. 

b). Assist the responding unit as applicable. 

8. Dispatch Center‘s Responsibilities.  Upon notification of a suspicious 
death or impending death, Dispatch Center shall follow existing Unit 
Procedures for subsequent notifications.  Notify the Crimes Against 
Children Unit supervisor first to facilitate proper resources and personnel 
activation. 

9. Crimes Against Children Unit Supervisors' Responsibilities.  Upon 
learning of a suspicious death, the Homicide Unit Supervisor shall: 

a). Notify the division Lieutenant; 

b). Determine if the Crimes Against Children Investigation Unit should 
be dispatched; 

c). Determine if notification should be made to the Medical Examiner 
and/or District Attorney; 

d). Make any appropriate case assignments; 

e. Provide all authorized releases of information to the PICRU for 
release of information to members of the media; 

f). Assure next of kin notification if needed. 

10. Crimes Against Children Unit‘s Responsibilities.  On arrival, the 
following shall apply: 

a). Assume responsibility for all aspects of the investigation; 

  

b). Confer with the on-scene Supervisor and initial investigating 
officer(s) to establish case status; 

c). If indicated, provide for the dissemination of information, i.e. 
suspect information, possible witnesses, vehicles, and other evidence.  
This information shall be given to all assigned investigators and 
assisting patrol units. 

III. SUICIDE 

A. If the victim is older than 16 years of age, refer to procedure – Death 
Investigation/General Order 98-2 C. SUICIDES. 

B. If the victim is under age 16 treat as a child death investigation – homicide.  
Keep in mind that there is a strong relationship between suicide in children 
and sexual, physical and emotional abuse and the apparent suicide of a 
young child is highly suspicious.  

IV. NATURAL DEATHS 

A. Dispatch.  Recognize that a natural death can originally be dispatched as a 
"rescue assist" or other type of call.  The code may vary accordingly. 

B. Officers' Responsibilities--General.  Responding officers should approach a 
natural death similarly to a homicide.  The general responsibilities are: 

1. Protect/preserve life. 

2. Assess and stabilize the scene. 

3. Protect/preserve scene. 

4. Identify witnesses. 

5. Supervisor notification. 

C. Officers' Responsibilities--Specific.  The resolution of the mode of death as 
being the result of natural disease processes is based on factors which 
eliminate homicide, suicide, and accident as the cause of death. 

1. Be aware that the pathological condition which produced the death 
often is not readily apparent especially in young children.  Consequently, 
autopsy results may be needed to determine the actual cause of death.  
The death investigation should include homicide as a possible manner of 
death until another manner has been proven. 

2. Conduct interviews with witnesses, family members, medical personnel, 
and other appropriate people.  Attempt to determine any previous medical 
history or complaints. 

3. If possible, provide next of kin information to the shift supervisor or 
Medical Examiner, if no family members are present. 

4. Ensure the following notifications are made: 

a). Patrol Supervisor; 

  

b). Medical Examiner's Office.  The Medical Examiner‘s office will 
decide the disposition of the deceased 

5. Be alert to questionable circumstances.  A Supervisor shall be notified, 
should information come to the attention of officers casting doubt on the 
mode of death.  That Supervisor shall decide if the Homicide Unit 
Supervisor should be notified. 

6. Officers shall: 

a). Photograph the Scene; 

b). Complete a Police Report; and 

c). Complete a Death Investigation Report:  One copy of the Death 
Investigation Report shall accompany the deceased to the Medical 
Examiner's office. 

7. If the victim lived alone in a residence, that residence shall be locked 
and secured when the investigation has concluded. 

D. Patrol Supervisors' Responsibilities.  The Patrol Supervisor shall: 

1. Ensure the next of kin is notified; 

2. Assist the responding unit as applicable; 

3. Notify Crimes Against Children Supervisor. 

V. ACCIDENTAL DEATHS 

A. Dispatch.  Recognize that the dispatch for an accidental death can range 
from rescue assists, to overdoses, falls from great heights, and more.  Fatal 
automobile accidents are "accidental deaths," but are processed as described 
in the procedure "Traffic--Injury and Fatal Accidents". 

Especially significant in the accidental death of a child is whether or not the 
explanation of injury matches the scene evidence and age of development of the 
child.  A child who cannot walk will have difficulty falling from a window.  A child 
who does not yet have the physical coordination to open a medicine bottle will 
probably not overdose on medication.  

B. Officers' Responsibilities--General.  Responding officers should approach 
an accidental death similarly to a homicide.  The general responsibilities are: 

1. Protect/preserve life. 

2. Assess and stabilize the scene. 

3. Protect/preserve the scene. 

4. Identify witnesses. 

5. Supervisor notification. 

  

C. Officers' Responsibilities--Specific.  The resolution of the manner of death 
as being the result of an "accident" (an unexpected and unintentional event) 

is based on factors which eliminate homicide, suicide, and natural disease 
processes as the cause of death. 

1. Note that criminal charges may still result from an accidental death 
(criminal negligence). 

a). A proper investigation includes awareness of possible contributing 
circumstances.  This could include unsafe home conditions, severe 
child neglect or dangerous acts of others. 

b). Interviews should be conducted with witnesses and/or other 
appropriate persons (neighbors, family members). 

c). Should any questionable circumstances arise, or if the filing of 
criminal charges appears possible, notify a Supervisor.  That 
Supervisor shall decide if the Crimes Against Children Unit Supervisor 
should be notified. 

2. Autopsies are generally needed to conclude the actual cause of death. 

3. If possible, provide next of kin information to the shift supervisor or 
Medical Examiner, if no family members are present. 

4. Ensure the following notifications are made: 

a). Patrol Supervisor; 

b). Medical Examiner's Office.  The Medical Examiner‘s office will 
decide the disposition of the deceased; 

c). Crimes Against Children Unit Supervisor. 

5. Assist outside agencies with investigation if needed. 

6. Officers shall: 

a). Photograph the Scene; 

b). Complete a Police Report; and 

c). Complete a Death Investigation Report: One copy of the Death 
Investigation Report shall accompany the deceased to the Medical 
Examiner's office. 

D. Patrol Supervisors' Responsibilities. The Patrol Supervisor shall: 

1. Ensure the following notifications are made: 

a).Next of kin notification. 

b). The Patrol Supervisor shall notify, cause to be notified, or verify that 
notification has been made to any appropriate agency.  Depending on 
the nature of the accidental death, such notification could include: 

i. Municipal Fire Investigator if a fire death.

3.01.020  Death Notification 

To advise all sworn personnel of the guidelines for making death notifications. 

That death notifications be made as immediately as possible to all appropriate 
parties, and that such notification be done accurately and with compassion. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

Of all the possible contacts that officers can have with the public, death 
notification stands out as potentially the most stressful and traumatic for both the 
survivors being notified and the officer(s) making the notification.  This is 
understandable for a variety of reasons--some obvious, some less apparent.  For 
officers, death notification is a rare call that cannot be practiced, and it demands 
emotional skills instead of the physical and technical skills so well trained and 
practiced in police work.  For the family, an obvious loss is faced, and the focus 
of their attention is on the officers present.  Unlike a form that can be corrected 
later, the method and effect of death notification is indelibly marked on the 
survivors.  Experience has shown that if a few fundamental guidelines are 
followed, the mutual trauma of this kind of call can be minimized. 

Survivors:  For purposes of this procedure, "survivor(s)" are those people within a 
death victim's family who remain alive.  As used here, "family" includes 
"significant others," as described in the Domestic Violence statutes. 

DEFINITIONS 

PROCEDURE 

I. GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR DEATH NOTIFICATIONS 

A. Collection of Information.  Officers should amass as much information as 
practical regarding: 

 

  

1. The victim, unless highly unusual circumstances exist, positive 
identification of the victim shall be made prior to next-of-kin notification.   

2. The event, so that it can be discussed intelligently; and 

3. The survivor(s), to anticipate violent reactions, medical complications, 
or other adverse reactions to the news of the death. 

B. Timeliness.  The survivor(s) should be notified as soon as practical, with 
every effort to make notification prior to any news releases. 

C. Responsibility.  The investigating officer shall provide all of the necessary 
and appropriate information to his/her supervisor for notification purposes.  It 
shall be the responsibility of the supervisor to make the next-of-kin notification 
unless specifically directed otherwise by the supervisor or commander.   

D. Resources.  Officers are reminded that there are two potential sources of 
assistance, namely: 

1. The neighbor(s).  Often a neighbor can suggest other relatives and/or 
friends to be present or available during notification, or alert officers to 
possible medical reactions, and so forth.   

2. The clergy.  Many people are comforted by having a member of the 
clergy available for support.  A chaplain may be contacted through APD 
dispatch to assist in the notification or with grief counseling. 

E. Method.  How a person is notified is very critical.  Below are guidelines 
established by experience, and recommended by behavioral scientists: 

1. Never make a death notification over the telephone, even if a personal 
contact will delay notification by days. 

a). Should it become necessary to make a death notification in another 
jurisdiction, it should be done through and with the assistance of the 
local police agency. 

2. Make every effort to have two officers present, with at least one in full 
uniform. This serves to: 

a). Add credibility to the information given; and 

b). Provide an officer to observe reaction to the news.  This safety 
measure recognizes that some people become dangerous to 
themselves or others when told catastrophic news, so restraint and/or 
medical assistance may become necessary. 

3. When possible, make contact at the survivor(s) residence.  When at the 
residence: 

a). Politely ask to come inside.  If a child answers the door, get 
permission to enter from a responsible adult. 

b). Introduce yourself (and the other officer).  If you are not in uniform, 
show credentials. 

  

c). Try to ensure the door is closed; and 

d). If possible, have the person(s) seated. 

e). Make certain you know who the parties are, and identify the closest 
survivor. Direct your conversation to him or her as much as practical. 

4. When actually telling of the event, try to abide by the following: 

a). Be compassionate but reasonably direct.  A sincere "I have some 
very bad news for you.  Your son was killed in an automobile accident 
last night" seems to be the best approach in most cases. 

b). Don't avoid the topic by using expressions such as "expired," or 
"passed away." 

c). Avoid trying to talk the people out of their grief by such comments 
as "It's God's will," or "She led a full life."  Avoid saying you 
"understand" unless you truly do.  The officer's role is to inform and 
guide in as professional and compassionate a manner as possible, and 
not, necessarily, to counsel. 

d). Don't rush.  There is a balance between rushing to get a 
disagreeable job over with, and stalling to look for just the right words.  
Deliver the news, be available for questions and help, and then start 
directing activities when appropriate. 

e). Anticipate physical contact.  It is normal for persons to clutch for 
security, or even to be angered by the news.  The second officer can 
help deter violence, but both officers should be alert to a probable non-
hostile movement and grabbing. 

F. Follow-up Activities.  Depending on the circumstances, the officer may be 
coordinating certain activities with the survivors.  Recall that, with some 
people, having duties to perform actually helps in the adjustment.  Others 
may have to be aided in satisfying their responsibilities.  It is recommended 
that officers: 

1. Leave his or her name and telephone number with the survivor(s). 

2. If possible, return the next day, if only for a "status check."  Experience 
has shown that this action is greatly appreciated by the parties concerned.

3.01.025  Domestic Violence Response and Investigation 

POLICY 

There is no specific offense of domestic violence.  The term is used to describe a 
range of criminal offenses occurring within particular relationships.  It is the policy 
of the Anchorage Police Department that physical arrests shall be made in cases 
where there is probable cause to believe that a violation of the domestic violence 
laws has occurred.   

Also paramount to the investigating officer is the responsibility to protect the 
victim of domestic violence.  This will be accomplished by following the 
requirements of Alaska State Statute and Anchorage Municipal Code. 

DEFINITIONS 

Domestic Violence is defined in AS 18.66.990 as a violation or attempt to commit 
a violation of any provision of the following state statutes or a similar local 
ordinance, when the victim is a household member. 

Murder, Incest, Manslaughter, Unlawful exploitation of a minor, Criminally 
negligent homicide, Indecent exposure, Assault, Robbery, Reckless 
endangerment, Extortion, Stalking, Coercion, Kidnapping, Burglary, Custodial, 
interference, Trespass, Sexual assault, Arson, Sexual abuse of a minor, 
Criminally negligent burning, Murder of an unborn child, Assault of an unborn 
child, Human trafficking, Online enticement of a minor, Violating a protective 
order [section (a)(1)], Criminal mischief, Harassment [section (a)(2)-(4)], and 
Terroristic threatening 

Domestic Violence Protective Order is a special type of restraining order issued 
by the court when convinced that the applicant has been a victim of domestic 
violence by a household member (defined below).  The applicant is known as the 
petitioner and the person the order is against is called the respondent.  The 
orders are defined as a domestic violence protective order (1 year), an ex-parte 
domestic violence protective order (20 days) and an emergency domestic 
violence protective order (72 hours).  Failure of the respondent to abide by the 

  

terms of the domestic violence protective order can result in arrest for violating a 
protective order. 

Fourth Degree of Consanguinity describes a relationship by descent from the 
same ancestor.  To determine the degree of consanguinity, count the 
generational steps between people on a family tree, working upward to a 
common ancestor and then downward again.  For example, first cousins are 
related to the 4th degree. 

Household Member is defined as: 

Adults or minors who are current or former spouses; 

Adults or minors who live together or have lived together; 

Adults or minors who are dating or who have dated; 

Adults or minors who are engaged in or who have engaged in a sexual 
relationship; 

Adults or minors who are related to each other up to the fourth degree of 
consanguinity whether of the whole or half blood or by adoption; 

Adults or minors who are related or formerly related by marriage; 

Persons who have a child of the relationship; or 

Minor children of a person in a relationship described above. 

Principal Physical Aggressor is the person responsible for the domestic violence 
crime to which the police were called.   

Probable Cause:  Reliable information in sufficient quantity and detail that would 
lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been committed or was 
attempted and that the suspect committed the crime.   

Similar Local Ordinance is defined as an Anchorage Municipal Ordinance that 
has similar elements to those offenses listed in Alaska Statute as being a crime 
of domestic violence.  Each investigation is unique but officers should review the 
elements of the following municipal ordinances for similarities: 

Assault, Vehicle Tampering, Stalking, Violation of Conditions of Release, Child

I GENERAL:  Significance of Domestic Violence – When officers recognize that 
an incident is domestic violence related several issues surface: 

PROCEDURES 

A. State statute gives officers the authority to arrest a perpetrator of domestic 
violence on probable cause alone, even if the offense is a misdemeanor 
which did not occur in the officer‘s presence.  AS 12.25.030 allows the officer 
to make an arrest without a warrant if the officer has probable cause to 
believe that the suspect has committed domestic violence, violated a 
protective order or violated conditions of release imposed on an original 
charge involving stalking or domestic violence.  No private person arrest is 
required. 

B. Mandatory Arrest: AS 18.65.530 states that a peace officer, with or without 
a warrant, shall arrest a person if the officer has probable cause to believe 
that the person has, within the previous 12 hours, committed domestic 
violence, violated a domestic violence protective order or violated conditions 
of release imposed on an original charge involving stalking, domestic 
violence, or sexual abuse and sexual assault. The statute also lists 
exceptions to mandatory arrest. The exceptions are: 

1. Homicide cases, 

2. When an officer receives authorization from a prosecuting attorney not 
to arrest, and 

3. When only the principal physical aggressor is arrested. 

C. Principal Physical Aggressor: If an officer receives complaints of domestic 
violence from more than one person arising from the same incident, the 
officer shall evaluate the conduct of each person to determine who the 
principal physical aggressor was.  If the officer determines that one person 
was the principal physical aggressor, the other person or persons need not be 
arrested.  To determine the principal physical aggressor the officer shall 
consider: 

1. Prior complaints of domestic violence, 

2. The relative severity of the injuries inflicted on each person, 

3. The likelihood of future injury from domestic violence to each person, 

4. Whether one of the persons acted in defense of self or others. 

D. Physical Arrest: When an officer determines there is probable cause to 
believe that a person committed domestic violence, the officer shall make an 
arrest to be in compliance with Department policy and state law.  This will be 
a physical arrest with appearance before a magistrate.  A misdemeanor 
citation is not appropriate.  

  

E. Juvenile Suspects: A juvenile suspect requires an arrest to fall within the 
law and APD policy.  However, because guidelines for juvenile remands are 
different than those of adults, a physical arrest with remand to McLaughlin 
may not be possible. Officers are required to contact McLaughlin and explain 
the circumstances of the offense, allowing McLaughlin to accept or reject 
placement of the juvenile. The officers are required to document that contact 
in the police report. Should McLaughlin not remand the suspect, victim safety 
is the top priority when making a determination as to the proper placement for 
the juvenile suspect. Officers should consider options such as a relative, 
Covenant House or foster placement. 

F. Mandatory Arrest: Note that the law requires mandatory arrest with 
probable cause if the offense occurred within the previous 12 hours.  If the 
offense is reported more than 12 hours after it occurred, the officer is no 
longer required to make a mandatory arrest but still may arrest without a 
warrant.  In most cases when an officer determines probable cause exists, an 
arrest is the preferred disposition. 

G. Statutory Responsibilities: Officers will comply with statutory 
responsibilities to the victim which include transporting the victim and any 
family member to a safe place, assisting the victim in removing essential 
personal items from the residence, assisting the victim and any member of 
the victim‘s family in obtaining medical treatment necessitated by the offense 
and both orally and in writing informing the victim of the rights and services 
available to them.   

H. Deadly Weapons: Officers may also seize any deadly weapon in plain view 
and if a deadly weapon was used or possessed during the domestic violence 
the officer may seize all deadly weapons owned, used, possessed or within 
the control of the alleged perpetrator. 

I. When investigating a crime involving domestic violence, the officer may not 
threaten or suggest the arrest of all parties involved in a manner that would 
have a tendency to discourage requests for intervention by law enforcement. 

J. Victim Notification: After arrest, if the defendant is released from other than 
a correctional facility, the arresting authority shall make reasonable efforts to 
notify the alleged victim of the defendant‘s release and provide the victim with 
a copy of the order setting any conditions of release.  Officers must document 
their efforts at notification of the victim in the report.  If the defendant is 
remanded to a correctional facility, the officer shall provide a copy of the 
completed ATN with the victim‘s contact information to the Department of 
Corrections in order to facilitate them making the proper notification upon the 
defendant‘s release.   

K. Mandatory Reporting: When an arrest is made, the officer will document 
the circumstances in a police report.  A report is also required when an officer 
investigates a complaint of ―domestic violence‖ as defined above and does 
not make an arrest. In such cases, officers shall describe in writing the 
reasons for not making an arrest.  This information should be included in the 

  

narrative portion of the report and is based upon your description of the 
incident, not a single statement. 

L. Prosecutor Contacts: If contact was made with a prosecutor or district 
attorney, officers are discouraged from detailing, in the report, the 
conversation and the specific reasons that were provided for not making an 
arrest.  Often, these written statements make a future prosecution more 
difficult if new information or evidence becomes available.   

II. INITIAL RESPONDER‘S RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Arrival:  Any call for service can escalate at any time. However domestic 
violence calls can be particularly volatile.  Officers are reminded to practice 
good officer safety tactics.   

B. Investigation:  When investigating an incident where domestic violence is 
suspected, the officer must be able to establish both that a violation of law 
occurred and that the relationship between the victim and suspect fits within 
the scope of ―household members‖ defined above.  Additionally, because of 
the unique position of the victim, officers need to make reasonable efforts to 
gather independent evidence of the offense.  This evidence will often be in 
the form of physical evidence and testimonial evidence from people other 
than the victim (children, witnesses, complainants, family, friends and 
neighbors). 

1. Separate all parties for interview purposes, especially the victim and 
suspect. Conduct audio-recorded interviews with all victims and 
witnesses. Officers are encouraged to interview all juveniles who may 
have been victims or witnesses to the incident, while taking into 
consideration the age and abilities of the juvenile.  Officers shall also 
make an effort to conduct a taped statement with the defendant, being 
mindful of Miranda issues. 

2. Seize all physical evidence at the time of the call. 

3. Take photographs.  Good investigation technique calls for: 

a). being aware that bruising can become visible later and follow-up 
photos to capture that evidence might be in order. 

b). being discreet when photographing physical injury.  Covering 
unaffected anatomy can help insure the usefulness of the 
photograph as evidence in court. 

c). being alert to exculpatory evidence.  If a complainant alleges 
vandalism or assault but no damage or injury can be found, a 
photograph showing no damage is an important form of evidence. 

4. Officers should pay close attention to victim complaints of strangulation. 
This sophisticated method of power and control is particularly dangerous. 
Incidents of strangulation, properly investigated and documented, fit the 
definition of serious physical injury and should result in felony charges 
against the suspect.  Officers who arrive on scene may find the suspect 

  

with visible injuries and the victim with none.  If both claim self defense, 
officers need to avoid the temptation just to arrest the person who is 
perceived to have won the fight, or the person with no injuries.  Special 
care must be taken to identify the principal physical aggressor.  

C. Disposition:  If, after thoroughly investigating the complaint of domestic 
violence, the officer determines probable cause exists to believe that a crime 
involving domestic violence has occurred, the officer shall make a physical 
arrest as outlined above.  If probable cause does not exist, the officer shall 
document the circumstances of the investigation in a police report. 

1. Officers should charge under either municipal code or state statutes for 
the specific crime committed, noting the offense as domestic violence 
related.  This is accomplished by adding ―DV‖ to the criminal charge and 
marking ―DV‖ on the face sheet of the police report, arrest sheet and ATN. 

2. The victim has the right to attend the bail hearing should they choose to 
do so. Officers shall inquire if the victim wishes to telephonically 
participate and note that action in their police report. 

3. The officer shall notify the victim, both orally and in writing, of the rights 
of victims and the services available to them.  This can be accomplished 
by reading and leaving a copy of the ―DV Booklet‖, currently the 
Anchorage Community Emergency and Advocacy Resources booklet.  

4. Steps should be taken to protect the victim from further domestic 
violence.  This includes, but is not limited to, providing the victim 
transportation, assisting the victim in removing personal items, assistance 
in obtaining medical treatment, and the seizure of weapons as 
appropriate.  Should the defendant be released on their own 
recognizance, the officer must notify the victim of that.  If necessary, an 
officer may also, with the knowledge and consent of the victim, apply for 
an emergency protective order. 

5. If the suspect is not present when the officer arrives and the 
investigation reveals probable cause to believe a crime of domestic 
violence occurred, officers should search the immediate area and make 
other reasonable efforts to attempt to locate the suspect.  In the event the 
officer is unable to locate the suspect, the officer shall immediately apply 
for an arrest warrant.  Upon obtaining the warrant it is the officer‘s 
responsibility to notify APD or AST for timely entry of the warrant, noting in 
the report the DSN of the person entering the warrant.  

a). Officers who obtain an arrest warrant for a domestic violence 
offense should continue to make reasonable efforts to locate the 
suspect. 

b). When serving an original warrant for a domestic violence offense, 
the arresting officer should attempt an interview with the defendant, 
whether or not the arresting officer is the same officer who originally 
obtained the warrant. 

  

6. Officers shall make appropriate notification to outside agencies as 
required by current procedure and document doing so in the police report.   

a). In all cases of domestic violence where the parties involved have 
children; officers must notify the Office of Children‘s Services with the 
APD case number.  This can be accomplished by selecting ―OCS‖ in 
the follow-up drop-down menu, thereby causing the report to be 
forwarded automatically. The officer may also elect to call 269-4000 
and provide the necessary information. 

D. Domestic Violence Unit:  The Domestic Violence Unit reviews all domestic 
violence reports to make sure that all necessary investigative steps were 
taken to ensure the victim‘s safety as well as offender accountability.  Follow-
up investigation will occur on any report as needed to include, but not limited 
to: 

1. Contact the victim to inquire whether they need any further assistance. 

a). taking additional photographs 

b). complete audio recorded interviews 

c). attempt to serve outstanding domestic violence warrants 

d). provide assistance to the prosecuting agency to ensure successful 
prosecution 

The Domestic Violence Unit is located in the Domestic Violence Office at the 
Boney Courthouse.  The officers also provide assistance to any citizen who 
comes into the courthouse needing assistance with a domestic violence 
situation. 

Patrol officers shall complete a thorough investigation in accordance with 
policy at the time of the report.  If follow-up investigation is needed that they 
cannot complete themselves, officers may provide direct notification to one of 
the Domestic Violence Unit officers and request that they complete the follow-
up. 

E. Domestic violence protective orders:  Domestic Violence Protective 
Orders, issued by the court, are served and enforced by the Anchorage 
Police Department.   

1. Service:  After petitioning the court and having a domestic violence 
protective order granted, the order must be served on the respondent in 
order for it to be enforced.  Although most protective orders are processed 
and served by the Warrants section, Patrol is often called upon to serve 
them as well. 

2. Officers who come into contact with a respondent of a protective order 
which has not yet been served shall make reasonable efforts to obtain a 
copy of the order and serve it on the respondent.  If a copy is not 
available, the officer shall verbally inform the respondent of the specific 
terms of the protective order and then document that action on a Return of 

  

Service form.  The terms of the order are annotated in APSIN.  The officer 
shall also obtain the respondent‘s contact information to ensure later 
service of a copy of the order.  

3. When serving protective orders, officers shall: 

a). Receive the order, verifying that it has been properly issued.  This 
can be done by verifying the order in APSIN or with the issuing court; 

b). Serve the order on the respondent by reading the order and 
providing a copy of the order to the respondent; 

c). Contact appropriate personnel to have the record of service entered 
into APSIN, and note their DSN on the Return of Service Form; 

d). Complete a Return of Service form and submit it to the Records 
Section. 

4. Enforcement of the order:  Complaints of violation of a domestic 
violence protective order shall be investigated as a crime involving 
domestic violence as outlined above. When investigating an allegation of a 
violation of a domestic violence protective order, officers must establish 
three elements:   

a). The suspect had knowledge and legal service of the order; 

b). The act alleged violated a specific prohibition expressed in the 
order; 

c). Probable cause that the respondent actually committed the violation 
exists. 

5. Officers must take care to confirm that the act alleged constitutes a 
criminal violation of the order prior to making an arrest.  Those provisions 
which are criminal involve contact with the victim (sections a-e on all the 
orders) as well as the possession of firearms (sections i and j on the long 
term order).  If the violation is clearly criminal in nature and there is 
probable cause, the officer shall make an arrest.  If the alleged violation is 
civil in nature (orders to pay child support, pay specific bills, or return 
property), officers shall not make an arrest but a report is still required. 

6. A written report must be completed for any violation of the protective 
order, criminal or civil, whether or not the order has been served on the 
respondent.  It is important to document these non-criminal acts in the 
event it becomes necessary to have documentation for possible future 
criminal charges such as stalking.  Dispatch will screen the call for service 
to determine if the report will be taken by an officer or by records.  If either 
of the following criteria is met, an officer will be dispatched to take the 
report.  If not, the report will be taken by records.   

a). If there is any possibility that the officer may be able to locate the 
respondent and serve the restraining order. 

  

b). If there is the allegation or possibility that a new crime has been 
committed.   

7. ―Blending‖ of State and Municipal charges should be avoided. 
Therefore, if a respondent violates the terms of a protective order, which 
must be charged under State Statutes, other associated violations should 
also be State charges. 

F. Violation of Conditions of Release:  The violation of conditions of release 
allows the police to enforce conditions of bail imposed upon a defendant by a 
judge or magistrate while the defendant is awaiting trial. 

1. Conditions vary from one case to the next.  In domestic violence cases 
the defendant will generally be prohibited from having contact with the 
victim(s) or returning to the victim‘s residence. 

2. Officers can verify a defendant‘s conditions in several different ways.  
Contacting the Municipal Prosecutor or District Attorneys Office, 
whichever is appropriate given the original charge, is the ideal way to do 
so.  Recognizing this may not be possible given the time of day, officers 
should consider sources such as the jail or magistrate.  The victim may 
have a copy of the defendant‘s conditions or have a specific contact name 
or number with the Prosecutor or District Attorney.  The defendant might 
have a copy of the conditions of release available for your review or make 
admissions to the officer regarding what the conditions are.  

3. Currently, the Municipal Prosecutor‘s Office enters the conditions of 
release for DV cases into APSIN, attached to the defendant. The APD 
Dispatch supervisor also has access to the Municipal Prosecutor‘s 
database and can verify the listed conditions. 

4. If a victim makes a report of violation of conditions of release, the officer 
shall investigate the complaint as a crime of domestic violence as 
described above.   

5. If an officer is unable to determine at the time of the report whether or 
not the reported behavior violated a condition of the defendant‘s release, 
the officer shall document the incident in a police report.  The investigating 
officer is also required to follow up on the report by contacting the 
Prosecutor or DA as soon as possible.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a

3.01.030  Stalking Orders 

To instruct all personnel of the policies and procedures governing the service and 
enforcement of stalking orders. 

It is the policy of the Anchorage Police Department that stalking protective orders 
be served in a timely manner and enforced appropriately to enhance victim 
safety. 

Stalking Order is a specific type of restraining order issued by the court when 
convinced that an applicant (petitioner) is a victim of stalking by the respondent.  
These orders are specifically designed for use by persons not in a domestic 
violence situation.  They are defined as stalking protective orders (6 months), ex-
parte stalking protective orders (20 days), and emergency stalking protective 
orders (72 hours).

I. GENERAL 

A. State statute gives officers the authority to arrest a respondent for violating a 
stalking protective order on probable cause alone, even if the offense is a 
misdemeanor which did not occur in the officer‘s presence.  No private person 
arrest is required. 

B. Unlike domestic violence protective order violations, the law has no 
requirement for mandatory arrest for a violation of a stalking order. If probable 

  

cause does exist to make an arrest, a supervisor will be contacted for approval to 
not make the arrest, which will be noted in a police report.   

II. INITIAL RESPONDER‘S RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Service of stalking orders:  After issuance of a stalking order, the order 
must be served on the respondent in order for it to be enforced.  Although 
most stalking orders are processed and served by the Warrants section, 
Patrol may be called upon to serve them as well.   

B. Officers who come into contact with a respondent who has a stalking order 
needing to be served shall make reasonable efforts to obtain a copy of the 
order and serve it on the respondent.  If a copy is not available, the officer 
shall verbally inform the respondent of the specific terms of the stalking order 
and document that action on a Return of Service form.  The specific terms are 
listed under the advisement in APSIN.  The officer shall also obtain the 
respondent‘s contact information to ensure later service of a copy of the 
order. 

C. When serving stalking orders, officers shall: 

1. Receive the order, verifying that it has been properly issued.  This can 
be done by verifying the order in APSIN or with the issuing court; 

2. Serve the order on the respondent by reading the order and providing a 
copy of the order to the respondent; 

3, Contact appropriate personnel to have the record of service entered 
into APSIN and note the DSN on the Return of Service form; 

4. Complete a Return of Service form. 

D. Enforcement of stalking orders:  When investigating an allegation of a 
violation of a stalking order, officers must establish three elements: 

1. The suspect had legal service of the order; 

2. The alleged act violated a specific prohibition expressed in the order; 

3. Probable cause that the suspect actually committed the violation exists. 

E. Disposition:  Any complaint of a stalking order violation shall be 
documented in a police report. 

1. If an officer has probable cause to believe that the respondent violated 
the terms of a stalking order, a physical arrest is the preferred course of 
action.  Officers choosing not to make an arrest must document in the 
report their reasons for not doing so. 

2. If the suspect is not on scene, officers shall make reasonable efforts to 
locate the suspect.  If unable to do so, the officer should apply for a 
warrant for the suspect before the end of the officer‘s shift.  Once the 
warrant is obtained, it is the responsibility of the officer to contact AST for 
entry of the warrant.

3.01.035  Operating Under the Influence 

The objective of the Department‘s aggressive enforcement program is to reduce 
alcohol and drug related traffic offenses by using patrol units that are trained and 
equipped to apprehend and process impaired drivers. 

It is the policy of the Anchorage Police Department to aggressively enforce the 
Driving Under the Influence related statutes of the State of Alaska and the 
Municipality of Anchorage. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

The Anchorage Police Department recognizes the significant threat to public 
safety posed by drivers impaired by alcohol and/ or drugs.  The Department 
maintains the position that the most effective method of dealing with this problem 
is to combine enforcement with education.  The Anchorage Police Department 
officers will detect, apprehend and assist in the prosecution of persons in 
violation of the Driving Under the Influence statutes by providing officers on-going 
training in DUI countermeasures, and to work with the community to address the 
serious problems resulting from these violations.

I. TRAINING 

PROCEDURE 

A. Patrol officers will be trained and will maintain a current breath test 
operator certification from the State of Alaska. 

II. DETECTION AND ARREST 

A. All officers, regardless of their assignment, are to actively attempt to detect 
drivers driving under the influence of alcohol, other drugs, or a combination 
thereof, 

B. If an officer observes a vehicle whose driver he/she believes is under the 
influence, and has reasonable suspicion or probable cause to stop the 
vehicle, enforcement action will be taken: 

1. If the officer is driving a police vehicle which cannot initiate traffic stops, the 
officer will establish radio contact with Dispatch and attempt to have a marked 
unit respond to initiate the stop; 

2. If the officer is driving a police vehicle which can initiate traffic stops, the 
officer will take enforcement action by initiating a traffic stop on the vehicle. 

C. Upon stopping the vehicle, the officer will attempt to determine if the driver 
is under the influence by using Standardized Field Sobriety Tests and/or 
optional tests such as Rhomberg balance, finger to nose, alphabet, counting 
and other observational clues to establish probable cause. 

D. Officer will not use a Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) to establish probable 
cause. 

E. If probable cause has been established the subject shall be arrested. 

F. Impound the suspect‘s vehicle in accordance with AMC 9.28.026 (see also 
"Towing--Vehicular Impounds,‖). 

III. CHEMICAL TEST: 

A. Breath Test: 

1. Breath tests will be conducted by a certified breath test operator. 

2. Arrested subjects will be tested on instruments certified by the State of 
Alaska and maintained by the Anchorage Police Department; 

3. Following the arrest, the subject will not smoke or ingest any material 
into the mouth, with the exception of inhalers that are prescribed and 
medically necessitated.  A 15 minute observation is required after 
checking the arrestee‘s mouth and during this time, the arrestee shall not 
burp, regurgitate, vomit or place anything into the mouth. 

IV. IMPLIED CONSENT LAW 

A. Introduction.  The person arrested for DUI is processed to obtain specific 
evidence, usually a breath sample for chemical analysis. 

  

B. Content of Law.  The Implied Consent Law states that a suspect who is 
under lawful arrest for an offense arising out of acts alleged to have been 
committed while the person was driving, operating, or in actual physical 
control of a motor vehicle or operating an aircraft or a watercraft while 
impaired shall be considered to have given consent to a chemical test or tests 
of their breath for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content of his or 
her breath, and that refusal to do so is an additional crime. Non-consensual 
taking of a breath sample is obviously not practical, and non-consensual 
taking of a blood sample is permissible only in certain circumstances as 
described below. 

V. CONTACT WITH ATTORNEYS, FRIENDS, AND FAMILY 

A. Right to Contact with Attorney, Friend or Family. 

1. Prior to arrest.  The stop, the development of suspicion and the field 
sobriety/investigation occur before arrest, and no right to counsel exists. 

2. After the arrest.  If the suspect requests to telephone anyone after 
arrest (when State statute allows), but prior to direct questions (when 
Constitutional provisions require advisement), honor the request by 
providing a reasonable opportunity to the suspect. 

3. Direct questioning.  Police must provide a Miranda warning for arrested 
suspects before asking direct, potentially incriminating questions, such as 
those contained in the Intoxication Report.  If an attorney is requested, 
allow the contact but do not ask any further questions. Attorneys cannot 
delay DUI processing. 

VI. SPECIAL PROCEDURES 

A. Person Other than DUI Suspect Injured.  If a person is under arrest for an 
offense arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person 
was driving, operating, or in physical control of a motor vehicle, and that 
arrest results from a traffic collision that causes death or serious physical 
injury to another person, a chemical test may be administered without the 
consent of the person arrested to determine the amount of alcohol in that 
person‘s blood or breath (AS 28.35.031(g) / AMC 9.28.021.G).  The preferred 
and recommended method for doing this is to apply to a magistrate for a 
search warrant to have a blood and urine sample drawn from the suspect and 
tested.  If a chemical test is administered to a person under this provision, 
that person cannot be charged for refusal to submit to a chemical test.  If 
someone other than the suspected impaired driver was injured in an accident, 
the driver does not have the right to refuse a chemical test (AMC 
9.28.025A/AS 28.35.031(g). 

B. DUI Suspect is the Only Injured Party.  A suspected impaired driver who is 
injured in a traffic collision and is transported to a hospital (no one else injured 
in the collision) will be treated at the hospital prior to any arrest.  In normal 
operating procedures, an emergency room doctor may take a blood sample 
for analysis.  This result may be obtained by either obtaining a ‗Consent to 

  

Release Medical Records‘ form signed by the suspect or by search warrant at 
a later date.  Do not ask a doctor to take a sample for you and do not attempt 
to pressure a doctor into taking a sample for you.  If the person is not deemed 
serious enough to hold for treatment, you can simply arrest him or her within 
the 4 hour time limit and transport him/her to a sub-station for normal DUI 
processing.  If a blood sample is taken by the doctor and the suspect refuses 
to sign consent for release of medical records form, it is the officer‘s 
responsibility to coordinate with the Municipal Prosecutor‘s Office and obtain 
a search warrant.  Serve the warrant and, if appropriate based on the results, 
prepare a complaint and summons. 

C. Unconscious/Incapable Persons.  A person who is unconscious or 
otherwise in a condition rendering that person incapable of refusal is 
considered not to have withdrawn the consent provided under Implied 
Consent and a chemical test may be administered to determine the amount of 
alcohol in that person‘s breath or blood.  A person who is unconscious or 
otherwise incapable of refusal need not be placed under arrest before a 
chemical test is administered (AS 28.35.035(b) / AMC 9.28.025.B).  If a 
chemical test is administered to a person under this provision, that person 
cannot be charged with refusal to submit to a chemical test.  The critical 
question is the test of ―otherwise incapable‖.  Court decisions are not 
definitive, but tend to consider the physical condition of the subjects 
themselves, as opposed to the circumstances around them.  If the suspect is 
so impaired as to be incoherent and incapable of intelligently refusing, a test 
may be taken.  If, however, the suspect is able to intelligently decide, but 
other circumstances prevent him/her from going to a breath test facility, the 
involuntary test may NOT be administered.  An example of this is a 
conscious, lucid subject being kept at the hospital for observation, but no 
medical blood test taken.  In such cases, a search warrant, telephonic or in 
person, must be obtained to draw a blood sample. 

D. Suspected Drug Impairment.  If the suspect provided a breath test that 
yielded a very low reading, yet he/she shows signs of a much higher level of 
impairment, request a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE).  Be alert for drug 
usage, illness or injury.  Be alert for signs of drug abuse (i.e., needle tracks, 
pill bottles, drugs (prescription or illicit), and drug paraphernalia on the person 
or in the vehicle.  If there is any concern for the well-being of the subject, 
arrange to have him/her examined by a doctor immediately.  If the officer has 
already arrested the subject but now, as a result of the exam, feels the 
charges to be inappropriate, he or she should contact a shift Supervisor. 

E. Traffic collisions with Critical or Fatal Injuries.  When impaired driving is 
suspected in traffic collisions that result in critical injuries or fatalities, the 
possibility of felony charges being brought must be preserved.  Arresting for 
DUI could jeopardize this, and so must be avoided.  Such collisions are, 
therefore, not handled as a conventional DUI arrest and processing, but have 
a distinct procedure (see Traffic--Injury and Fatal Accidents).  Such collisions 

  

are usually investigated by the Traffic Unit, but initial responding units must 
take proper action to facilitate the investigation.  This includes: 

1. Treat the area of the traffic collision as a major crime scene, protecting 
it and limiting access to only those people providing care for victims or 
actually involved in the investigation. 

2. If possible, take multiple photographs or video to record the scene prior 
to disturbing anything. 

3. Identify and separate persons involved in the traffic collision, but avoid 
making any arrests. 

4. Should a DUI suspect be transported to a hospital, an officer should 
accompany that person. 

5. Be prepared to brief the traffic collision investigator.  However, if the 
Traffic Section is unable to respond, officers should be prepared to 
conduct the investigation on its behalf.  Again, the procedure ―Traffic--
Injury and Fatal Traffic Collisions‖ should be consulted.  The most 
remarkable difference between this collision investigation and others has 
to do with seizing blood as evidence.  Since DUI is not being charged at 
this time (to allow for charging a more serious crime), Implied Consent 
does not apply.  Seizing blood as evidence would follow this process: 

a). Attempt to get a search waiver form signed by the subject to obtain 
a sample of breath or blood.  Keep in mind that the suspect could pull 
his/her consent at any point before the samples are drawn, causing the 
officer to have to apply for a search warrant.  If this happens, valuable 
time has been wasted.  Because of this possibility, it is preferable to 
apply for the search warrant as soon as observations and evidence 
provide the probable cause to do so.  Coordinate with the District 
Attorney‘s Office or Traffic Investigator in obtaining a search warrant. 

b). Have the blood sample drawn at the hospital or a substation by the 
contracted medical company, either by search warrant waiver or by an 
actual search warrant. 

c). If alcohol is suspected and a waiver or warrant is obtained, 3 (three) 
blood samples are to be drawn at 30-minute intervals, along with one 
urine sample. 

d). If alcohol is not suspected and a waiver is obtained, one blood 
sample and one urine sample are sufficient. 

VII. ARRESTS BY OUTSIDE AGENCIES 

A. Military Law Enforcement Officers.  The Anchorage Police Department will 
process DUI suspects that Military law enforcement personnel detain if those 
suspects are not members of the military.  Military personnel cannot arrest, 
transport, or process non-military people for DUI.  Consequently, when a 
military law enforcement officer detects a DUI, they will call for an Anchorage 
police officer.  The responding officer will follow the guidelines of this policy. 

  

B. Alaska State Troopers.  On rare occasions, the Alaska State Troopers may 
have a need to use Department facilities.  The following would apply: 

1. State Troopers are responsible for the arrest and processing. 

2. Anchorage officers will provide technical assistance as needed, forms, 
etc., and may operate the breath test instrument if the Trooper is not 
qualified to do so. 

3. A police report entitled ―Outside Agency Assist‖ will document the 
actions of all Anchorage police officers involved.  All other documentation 
will remain with the other agency‘s officer.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.01.040  Hate Crimes 

To instruct all members on the method of identifying, investigating, and 
processing all crimes satisfying the Federal definition of "Hate/Bias" Crimes. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

That the Department: Actively participate in the Uniform Crime Reports program 
of statistically tracking Hate Crimes; and  

Aggressively and competently investigate all crimes satisfying the FBI's definition 
of Hate Crimes; and 

Provide follow-up services to victims of Hate Crimes. 

DISCUSSION 

On April 23, 1990, Congress enacted the "Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990."  
This act mandated the Department of Justice to collect data "about crimes that 
manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or 
ethnicity, including where appropriate the crimes of murder, non-negligent 
manslaughter; forcible rape; aggravated assault, simple assault, intimidation; 
arson; and destruction, damage or vandalism of property." 

To comply with this law, the Anchorage Police Department merely has to count 
the number of Hate Crimes it detects through the UCR system.  However, the 
advent of Hate Crime tracking has had another effect: Creating an awareness of, 
and sensitivity to, just how devastating such crime is.  As a consequence, the 
department has elected to broaden its responsibilities to more completely protect 
its citizenry.  This procedure, therefore, not only addresses how we comply with 
the UCR obligation, but describes how these offenses will be investigated, and 
what follow-up action the department will take with the victims. 

To more fully appreciate why such an aggressive approach to Hate Crimes is 
necessary, one needs only to consider what makes these violations unique.  
While a "regular" theft may be committed for money or gain, or a "regular" assault 

  

performed while in a temporary rage, a crime motivated by hate is designed to 
make a statement.  It is the highest form of malice, and is virtually beyond the 
control of the victim.  Its capricious nature puts all citizens in jeopardy, and 
fosters a contagious attitude of revenge. 

When someone falls prey to a bona fide Hate Crime, there is a sense of 
alienation from the mainstream.  Someone has violently stated, "You don't 
belong," often leaving the victim confused and feeling alone.  It is easy to see 
how the police, the strongest symbol of society, can either create a comforting 
sense of protection and reintegration into that mainstream using a professional, 
reassuring style, or elevate a perception of alienation with an apathetic, 
disgusted, or hostile demeanor. 

It is the goal of the Anchorage Police Department to help provide victims of Hate 
Crime with both the physical and psychological support they deserve, and 
demonstrate to persons who might consider committing a Hate Crime that such 
acts will not be tolerated. 

DEFINITIONS 

Hate Crime:  For purposes of this procedure, any criminal offense committed 
against a person or property which is motivated, in whole or in part, by the 
offender's bias against a race, religion, ethnic/national origin group, or sexual 
orientation group. 

For purposes of Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) tracking, "Hate" or "Bias" Crime is 
limited to murder, non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, aggravated assault, 
simple assault, intimidation, arson, destruction/damage/vandalism to property, 
robbery, and burglary when the commission is motivated in whole or in part by 
the offender's bias against a race, religion, ethnic/national origin group, or sexual 
orientation group. 

Bias Crime:  Same as "Hate Crime." 

Ethnicity/National Origin Bias:  A preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a 
group of person of the same race or national origin who share common or similar 
traits, languages, customs, and traditions (e.g., Arabs, Hispanics). 

Hate Group:  An organization whose primary purpose is to promote animosity, 
hostility, and malice against persons belonging to a racial, religious, 
ethnic/national origin, or sexual orientation group which differs from that of the 
members of the organization (e.g., the Ku Klux Klan, American Nazi Party). 

Racial Bias:  A preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a group of persons 
who possess common physical characteristics (e.g., color of skin; eyes and/or 
hair; facial features, etc.) genetically transmitted by descent and heredity which 
distinguish them as a distinct division of humankind (e.g., Asians, blacks, whites, 
etc.). 

Sexual Orientation Bias:  A preformed negative opinion or attitude toward a 
group of persons based on their sexual attraction toward, and responsiveness to, 

  

members of their own sex or members of the opposite sex (e.g., gays, lesbians, 
heterosexuals).

I. IDENTIFICATION OF A HATE CRIME 

PROCEDURE 

Hate Crime must first be recognized before either proper accounting (reporting to 
the UCR) or handling can occur.  To ensure that accurate identification is made, 
a multi-tiered system is used, knowing that it is the investigation that will 
ultimately determine if a hate crime has been committed or not.  That system is 
described as follows: 

A. Responding Officer.  Responding officers shall be trained in the definition 
and recognition of Hate Crimes.  If officers suspect that an incident meets the 
standards, they shall check the box on the Field Report titled "Hate." 

B. Classifier.  Since all written reports go to Classification, the Classifiers shall 
receive more advanced training in Hate Crimes.  If a Classifier believes that a 
report is one of a Hate Crime, or, if officers have identified one as such, that 
report shall be forwarded to the next level--the Captain of Detectives. 

C. Captain of Investigations.  The Captain of Detectives shall review all 
reports submitted to him/her that have been identified as a potential Hate 
Crime. If the Captain concurs that a Hate Crime seems to have been 
committed, they shall assign the case for any appropriate investigation and 
notify the Captain of Patrol of that determination. 

D. Investigator.  The sworn officer assigned the subject case shall perform 
two functions: 

1. Establish the essential elements of the criminal case, as normal; and 

2. Determine, through investigation, if a Hate Crime has been committed. 

II PROCESSING OF A HATE CRIME 

Once a potential Hate Crime is identified, it is processed.  This section describes 
the responsibilities of the various people who will take part in that processing. 

A. Responding Officer.  It is expected that responding officers will handle any 
call with a calm, professional demeanor.  But, as described in the 
"DISCUSSION" portion of this procedure, a genuinely sympathetic, 
reassuring approach is essential in these cases.  Beyond demeanor, 
responding officers other duties include checking the box marked "Hate" on 
the Field Report and ensuring the narrative supports officers determination 
that the event was a hate crime.  If any questions exist, responding officers 
shall seek the advice of either their supervisor, or any member of the Hate 

  

Crime Response Team that might be on shift (the Hate Crime Response 
Team is described in paragraph E. of this section). 

B. Classifier.  As mentioned earlier, Classifiers will have specialized training in 
Hate Crime, and act as the second level of screening to determine if a Hate 
Crime has been committed.  When reviewing reports, Classifiers shall be alert 
to any reported incident that may be a Hate Crime, and will closely review all 
reports submitted with the "Hate" box checked.  If determined to be a Hate 
Crime, the Classifier shall do two things: 

1. Forward a copy of the report to the Captain of Detectives with the 
notation that the incident meets the criteria of a Hate Crime as defined by 
the Anchorage Police Department. 

2. Determine if the incident qualifies as a Hate Crime as defined by the 
UCR. Recall that the UCR definition is more restrictive than the Anchorage 
Police Department's definition, in that only specified crimes can be Hate 
Crimes.  Since those particular crimes also have definitions unique to the 
UCR, the Classifier must translate the reported event to UCR terms, then 
decide if the Hate Crime standards have been met.  If so, the Classifier 
shall enter a tally on the appropriate accounting sheet.  The Classifier is 
the sole authority on whether or not a reported event is a UCR Hate Crime 
for statistical purposes. 

C. Captain of Detectives.  If the Captain of Detectives does not agree with the 
Classifier that a Hate Crime has occurred, they shall merely assign the case 
as normal (re-route the case, or return to Classification).  If, however, the 
Captain concurs with the Classifier that a Hate Crime (by APD standards) has 
occurred, they shall: 

1. Assign the case, and 

2. Establish the priority and intensity of the investigation. It is at this stage 
that the entire tone of the investigation is set, and the Captain of 
Detectives should weigh many factors when establishing how the 
department will respond to a particular allegation.  The importance of this 
decision cannot be overstated. 

3. Notify the Captain of Patrol.  The purpose of this notification is to alert 
the Hate Crime Task Force, by way of the chain of command, that there is 
a Hate Crime to process, and what level of urgency is attached to it. 

D. Captain of Patrol.  The Captain of Patrol shall notify the appropriate 
member(s) of the Hate Crime Task Force (considering shift affected, nature of 
case, and other factors). 

E. Hate Crime Response Team.  The Hate Crime Response Team is an 
internal group comprised of department volunteers who have undergone 
advanced training in Hate Crime.  Unlike the Classifiers, who are trained in 
the statistical aspects of Hate Crime, responders will have studied the 
dynamics of prejudice, victim sensitivity, and other investigative and 

  

humanistic aspects.  These volunteers are assigned throughout the 
department, and perform at least the following functions: 

1. Act as shift/division consultants on Hate Crime. 

2. Perform follow-up contacts with victims of Hate Crime.  This follow-up 
can include investigative tasks as assigned, but is primarily for humanistic 
reasons.  The exact techniques to be used shall be a topic of training, and 
beyond the scope of this procedure.  However, the fundamental goal of 
such contact is clear:  Reassure the victim(s) that the community wants 
the perpetrators identified and prosecuted; that the "statement" made by 
the malicious act does not represent the attitude of the community; and 
that they will receive the full protection of the police department.  

3. Provide recommendations and observations to the department for 
enhancing the handling of Hate Crimes. 

4. Act as liaison not only between the community and the Department, but 
between their shift/division and other divisions as well (Investigations, 
Crime Prevention, Training). 

III MISCELLANEOUS 

A. Charging.  Some jurisdictions have specific legislation that allows elevating 
a normal criminal violation to a "Hate Crime" if all the standards are met (in 
other words, a vandalism could be elevated to the more serious charge of 
Hate Crime if the element of hate motivation could be established). Currently, 
Alaska has no such provisions, so charging is done without respect to any 
bias motives (so a vandalism is always charged as a vandalism.  It cannot be 
elevated to anything else, even if clearly motivated by hate).  However, in 
establishing the charge, officers/investigators would be well advised to 
research the applicability of AS 11.76.110(a), Interference with Constitutional 
Rights. 

B. Recruitment and Selection of Hate Crime Responders.  The Chief of Police 
or a designee shall accept and review applications from employees who wish 
to volunteer to be members of the Hate Crime Response Team.  This group 
works entirely at the pleasure of the Chief.  Appointments can be made and 
rescinded as needed and circumstances dictate. 

C. Training.  It is expected that all members of the Department receive at 
least the general training in Hate Crimes.  That training, and the specific 
training required for Classifiers and Hate Crime Response Team members, 
shall be the responsibility of the Training Section of the Anchorage Police 
Department.

of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance

3.01.045  Missing/Runaway or Abducted Persons 

To instruct all personnel of the policies and procedures governing the 
investigation of missing/runaway or abducted persons.  

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

It shall be the policy of the Anchorage Police Department to reasonably 
investigate all reports of missing persons (both children and adults).  Additionally, 
this agency holds that every child reported as missing will be considered at risk 
until considerable information to the contrary is confirmed.  

Reports of missing persons will be accepted as soon as the call is received by 
dispatch, with no waiting period imposed to confirm the person‘s status. 

If a question arises as to parental custody of a missing child, the Anchorage 
Police Department will accept the report of a missing child even if custody has 
not been formally established.  Since the safety of a missing child is paramount, 
the Anchorage Police Department will begin an investigation when it can be 
shown that the child has been removed, without explanation, from his or her 
usual place of residence or current zone of safety (see definition below). 

DEFINITIONS 

Abduction:  The circumstance in which a person is taken by an individual, 
through force or persuasion, usually in furtherance of additional victimization. 

AMBER Alert:  The Alaska AMBER Alert Plan is a voluntary partnership between 
law enforcement agencies and broadcasters to alert the public in the event of a 
child abduction.  If the situation meets the appropriate criteria, the AMBER plan, 
will be activated.  Area radio and television stations will interrupt programming to 
broadcast information about the abducted child, suspect and suspect vehicle, 
using the Emergency Alert System (EAS).  This program is designed to gain 
public participation and support in passing on investigative leads to law 
enforcement to secure rapid and safe return of the abducted child. 

  

Child:  A person under the age of 18 years.  

Child of tender years:  A child who is at an age where he/she is generally 
incapable of fending for oneself, usually considered to be age 13 years or 
younger.  This is not a fixed age, but a general guideline. 

Missing Person Incident Command System:  A temporary organizational system 
in which resources are established, organized, and controlled during a large 
scale missing or abducted person incident. 

Missing Adult:  A person who is 18 years of age or older whose absence is 
contrary to his or her normal patterns of behavior and may involve unusual 
circumstances.  

Missing Child:  A person under the age of 18 years whose whereabouts are 
unknown to the person having responsibility for him/her and who left their 
custody for unknown reasons or under unusual circumstances.  

Runaway:  A person under 18 years of age who is habitually absent from home, 
or refuses to accept available care (AS 47.10.390 (2)). 

Zone of Safety:  The zone of safety will vary depending on age.  In the case of an 
infant, for example, the zone of safety shall include the immediate presence of an 
adult custodian, or the crib, stroller, or carriage in which the infant was placed. 
For a school age child, the zone of safety might be the immediate neighborhood 
or the route taken between home and school.  In the case of an elderly person of 
diminished physical and/or mental health, the zone of safety might include the 
close proximity and availability of a caregiver familiar with that individual‘s 
condition and needs.  

Unusual Circumstances: 

1. The missing person is 13 years of age or younger.  Younger people are in 
greater risk of being placed in danger or exploitation.  

2. The missing person is believed to be out of the zone of safety (see 
definition) for his or her age and developmental stage.  

3. The missing person is mentally incapacitated.  If the person is 
developmentally disabled or emotionally disturbed, he or she may have 
difficulty communicating with others about needs, identity, or address.  The 
disability places the person in danger of exploitation or other harm.  

4. The missing person is drug dependent.  In the case of a child, the term 
―drug dependent‖ shall refer to dependence on either prescription or illicit 
substances, since any drug dependency puts a child at substantially 
increased risk.  In the case of an adult, the term ―drug dependent‖ shall refer 
only to a dependence on legitimately prescribed drugs or medicines vital to 
the adult‘s continued physical well-being relating to an existing medically 
diagnosed condition.  This in no way limits an investigating officer‘s discretion 
in determining exigent circumstances on specific situations regarding an 
adult‘s use of illicit drugs.  

  

5. The missing person is a potential victim of foul play or sexual exploitation.  
Significant risk to the person can be assumed if investigation reveals 
indications of a possible abduction, violence at the scene of an abduction, or 
signs of sexual abuse.  

6. The missing person has been absent from home for more than 24 hours 
before being reported to the police.  While some persons may incorrectly 
assume that 24 hours must pass before law enforcement will accept a 
missing person case, a delay in reporting might also indicate the existence of 
neglect (in the case of a child) or abuse within the family. 

7. Based on available information it is determined that the missing person is 
in a life-threatening situation.  In Alaska, an example of this situation could 
involve being outdoors in inclement weather or not dressed for weather 
conditions.  

8. Based on available information the missing person is believed to be in the 
company of persons who could endanger his or her welfare.  

9. The absence is inconsistent with his or her established patterns of behavior 
and the deviation cannot be readily explained.  Most people have an 
established routine that is reasonably predictable.  Significant and 
unexplained deviations from that routine increase the probability that the 
person may be at risk.  

10. Other circumstances are involved in the disappearance that would cause 
a reasonable person to conclude that the missing person should be 
considered ―at risk‖.  

I. DISPATCH CENTER RESPONSIBILITIES 

PROCEDURES 

A. Upon receiving a report of a missing/runaway person, the Call-Taker shall 
determine if the circumstances of the report meet the definition of a missing 
child or adult and make a preliminary assessment about the level of risk to the 
missing person.  The level of risk is based upon the number and type of 
unusual circumstances that exist.  The Call-Taker shall obtain as much 
detailed information as possible and based upon the information that is 
received and,  

1. Assign an expedited response to the call for service should the 
information indicate a missing person under unusual circumstances, or 

2. Assign a routine response to the call for service should the information 
indicate the person is not missing under unusual circumstances, and  

3. Notify the Dispatch Supervisor. 

B. If the Call-Taker determines that the missing person is a runaway (see 
definition) with no unusual circumstances present and the complainant is an 
employee at a state run or supported facility (e.g. Camp Carroll or Booth 
Memorial), or the minor has been reported runaway 3 or more times within 

  

the last 12 months the call taker can transfer the call to Records for a report 
to be taken. 

1. The Records Clerk shall follow all applicable guidelines that are 
established and outlined this policy.  This should include calling Office of 
Children‘s Services answering service and leaving a message. 

a). Records will contact dispatch if there is any information on the 
possible whereabouts of the runaway.  Dispatch will have a patrol unit 
respond and attempt to contact/recover the runaway. 

2. The Dispatcher will broadcast a locate for the missing person and  

a) Dispatch an officer to the scene of the report per the assigned 
priority level for the circumstances referred to above (I.A.1 & 2.).  If the 
report is being made from school grounds by any person and there is a 
School Resource Officer available, a School Resource Officer should 
be utilized as the initial responder, and 

b). notify a Patrol Supervisor of the incident.  

3. In the event of a missing person under unusual circumstances the 
Dispatch Supervisor shall: 

a). Search department records for any related information.  It is 
essential for responding officers to know if the person or family has 
been the subject of previous reports that might have a bearing on this 
incident.  If possible, records should also be reviewed to learn if any 
incidents have been reported in the area that might have investigative 
value in this case.  Complaints such as attempted abductions, 
prowlers, public lewdness, and suspicious persons will be of particular 
interest.  

b). Access should be made to the Sex Offender Registry to determine 
if individuals designated as sexual predators reside, work, or might 
otherwise be associated with the area.  Access can be made to the 
registry through the State of Alaska web site at www.dps.state.ak.us.   

c). Consider providing stand-by notification to the APD Auxiliary 
Search Team if initial information appears as though they may be 
needed.  It is their desire to receive notification as soon as possible in 
order to lessen their response time if it is determined they will be 
needed.  Determine through the Incident Commander, who in the early 
stages will likely be the Patrol Supervisor) who will be designated the 
Search Team Manager from APD and have Auxiliary Search team 
coordinate with them (see Incident Command Structure below).  

d). When instructed by a commander activates the Alaska AMBER 
Alert system.  Amber alerts will be issued only when it has been 
determined that the following specific requirements have been met: 

i The abduction involves a child or children under the age of 18 
or someone with a known mental or physical disability; 

  

ii. Officers are reasonably certain that an abduction has 
occurred and the victim is believed to be in grave danger of 
serious bodily harm or death; and, 

iii. Enough descriptive information is available about: the victim; 
the suspect; and/or the suspect‘s vehicle to assist with the safe 
recovery of the victim and/or the apprehension of the suspect.  

iv. Amber Alerts are not to be used for Runaway or Family 
Abductions, unless investigation determines that the victim‘s life 
is in immediate danger.  Refer to the Alaska Amber Alert plan in 
dispatch for complete details.  

e). Ensure that the missing person is correctly entered into the NCIC 
Missing Person File.  The recommended categories are listed below: 

i. ―CA‖.  The Child Abduction flag will automatically notify the 
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the 
FBI‘s National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime of 
missing children cases.  The ―CA‖ flag is used when there is a 
reasonable indication or suspicion that a child has been 
abducted and/or is missing under circumstances suggesting foul 
play or a threat to life.  

ii. ―MKE*/EMD‖.  The Disability coding for a person of any age 
who is missing and under proven physical/mental disability or is 
senile, thereby subjecting him or herself or others to personal 
and immediate danger.  

iii. ―MKE/EME‖.  The Endangered coding for a person of any 
age who is missing under circumstances indicating that his or 
her safety may be in danger.  

iv. ―MKE/EMI‖.  The Involuntary coding for a person of any age 
who is missing under circumstances indicating that the 
disappearance may not have been voluntary (i.e., abduction or 
kidnapping). 

v. ―MKE/EMJ‖.  The Juvenile coding for a person younger than 
the age of 18 who is missing and does not meet any of the entry 
criteria set forth in the other categories.  

vi. ―MKE/EMV‖  The Catastrophe Victim coding for a person of 
any age who is missing after a catastrophe.  

II. INITIAL RESPONDER‘S RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. The first responding officer(s) to the scene of a missing person/runaway 
call shall employ the following considerations: 

1. Respond directly to the scene of the report.  

2. Interview the person(s) making the report. It is important to interview for 
the purpose of risk assessment.  

  

3. Obtain a detailed description of the missing person and broadcast an 
updated locate via, radio, MDT and Dispatch.  Obtain recent photographs, 
video tape, or any other identifying sources for the missing person.  

4. Verify that the person is in fact missing by personally checking the 
house and grounds including places where a person could be trapped, 
asleep, or hiding. Do not assume that a thorough search was conducted 
by those making the report.  The home of the missing person should be 
searched even if the missing person was last seen elsewhere.  Document 
the areas of the house searched and by which officer. 

5. In the case of a child, confirm the child‘s custody and obtain non-
custodial parent information if applicable. 

6. Determine the circumstances of the disappearance.  The first 
responding officers need to ascertain whether the circumstances 
surrounding a person‘s disappearance are such that a heightened level of 
response is warranted.  If ―unusual circumstances‖ exist (see definition), 
then the decision to employ additional responders and resources is clear. 
In other situations where the circumstances are not clear, officers should 
keep the missing person‘s safety in mind and act accordingly.  

7. Determine when, where, and by whom the missing person was last 
seen.  This information is needed to determine factors such as abduction 
time frame or window of opportunity and to verify previously received 
information. 

8. Interview the individual(s) who last had contact with the missing person. 
Effective questioning of those individuals who last saw or spoke with a 
missing person is important in the case-assessment process.  While 
seeking information about the person‘s appearance, demeanor, and 
actions, officers also should be alert to contradictions or evasiveness by 
the witness, especially if these statements cannot be readily 
substantiated.  

10. Identify the missing person‘s zone of safety (see definition) for his or 
her age and physical and mental state.  Responding officers should 
attempt to determine how far the missing person could travel from the 
location where last seen before he or she would most likely be at risk of 
injury or exploitation.  This perimeter should, under many circumstances, 
define the first search zone.  

11. Make an initial determination of the type of incident.  By employing all 
available assessment tools (interviews, witness statements, scene search, 
etc.) an officer should be able to reach a preliminary determination 
regarding the type of case and the need for additional resources.  Officers 
must be cautious in ―labeling‖ or classifying a missing person case, since 
the classification process will affect the way in which information or 
evidence is gathered.  Even if first indications suggest a ―less urgent‖ 

  

incident, officers should consider all possibilities until the case category is 
clearly determined.  

12. In the case of an abduction, obtain a detailed description of the 
suspected abductor(s) and other pertinent information.  If the abduction 
involves a business or other public place, officers may be able to obtain 
surveillance video from security cameras that might provide information 
about suspects, vehicles, and circumstances.  In the case of a suspected 
family abduction, the reporting party may have photographs of the 
abductor or other valuable information.  

13. Have dispatch enter the victim into the NCIC Missing Person file with 
the appropriate NCIC category and circumstance code (see I.B.3. above). 

14. Identify and interview all involved parties at the scene.  The name, 
address, home, work, and cell phone numbers of all involved at the scene, 
along with their relationship to the missing person, should be recorded.  

15. Conduct a thorough scene search.  With the assistance of additional 
personnel (potentially the crime scene team), a systematic, thorough 
search of the incident scene should be conducted.  If appropriate, officers 
should obtain written permission to search houses, apartments, 
outbuildings, vehicles, and other property that might hold information 
about the person‘s disappearance.  Officers are reminded to conduct a 
thorough, immediate search of the missing person‘s home and property, 
even if the disappearance supposedly took place elsewhere.  When 
possible officers should also search a missing child‘s school locker as well 
as any computer or electronic messaging systems to which a child has 
access.  

16. Secure and safeguard the area as a potential crime scene. Initial 
responding officers must take control of the immediate area where the 
incident occurred and establish an appropriate perimeter to avoid the 
destruction of evidence.  In addition to external crime scenes, the missing 
person‘s home, and particularly his or her bedroom, should be secured.  

17. Determine whether the person has access to an online computer, 
cellular telephone, pager or any other wireless communication device. 
Before making a decision that an adult is missing voluntarily or that a child 
has run away, an officer should determine if the person may have left to 
meet someone he or she encountered while online.  Since predators are 
known to use the Internet to identify vulnerable persons, what appears at 
first to be a ―runaway‖ case may in fact be an abduction/kidnapping by an 
online predator. 

18. Officers shall make reasonable efforts to locate a person reported as a 
runaway/missing even if unusual circumstances don‘t exist.  Reasonable 
efforts could include; 

a). attempting to locate the runaway at another residence or location 
where they are suspected to have gone now or in the past 

  

b). attempting to call known associates who might know where the 
person may have gone 

c). consider the possibility of contacting the school resource officer for 
the school that the runaway attends.  They can be useful in 
determining known associates. 

19. Determine if a runaway has been to Covenant House or another living 
facility before.  Contact could be made with the facility to determine if the 
runaway is currently there or has been there recently.  Officers are 
advised to speak with an on duty facility supervisor if difficulty is 
encountered after fully explaining the need for the information.  

20. Check all hospitals, D.O.C. detention centers, MYC, etc. and 
document the results. 

21. Officers are encouraged to provide the booklet, Anchorage Community 
Emergency and Advocacy Resources to the complainant.  Resources are 
available in the booklet for parents of runaway children.  

22. Prepare necessary reports and complete appropriate forms.  Reports 
should be very detailed and not just cover those events that seem to have 
a direct bearing on the case.  

23. All reports made about a missing/runaway juvenile should be referred 
to the Office of Children‘s Services for their review.  This can be done by 
leaving a telephone message with the answering service (currently 269-
4000) and providing them with the officer‘s name and DSN, the case 
number, and a brief description of the circumstances and the involved 
parties.  

III. PATROL SUPERVISOR‘S RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. The patrol supervisor shall be responsible for obtaining a briefing from the 
first responder(s) at the scene of a missing person under unusual 
circumstances.  This briefing allows the supervisor to determine the scope 
and complexity of the case and develop an appropriate response.  The 
briefing should be conducted away from family, friends, or any other 
individuals who may be present.  Doing so will allow officers to speak freely 
about the events that have transpired and pass along initial impressions and 
opinions that might be misconstrued by others.  

B. Supervisors are advised to consider whether the report of a missing person 
has occurred on state property (e.g. Eklutna, Flat Top, and Chugach State 
Park).  If it has, we will then act as support for the State Troopers or Parks 
Officers.  Under AS 18.60.150, the state has the authority and responsibility 
to investigate. 

C. Determine if additional personnel and resources are needed to assist in 
the investigation (e.g. Crime Scene Team, Detectives, APD Auxiliary Search 
Team, K-9, Public Information and Community Relations Unit, Federal Bureau 

  

of Investigation).  The supervisor is required to make contact with the 
Commander of the particular division if additional resources are needed 

D. Supervisors shall contact the local FBI office if the child is of tender years 
or when a confirmed non-custodial abduction has taken place.  The FBI is 
mandated by congress to investigate these types of incidents.  There is no 
requirement for the child to have been transported across state lines or for a 
ransom demand to have been issued.  The FBI has no elapsed time 
requirement before becoming involved in an investigation.  The FBI has 
available Child Abduction Rapid Deployment Teams with special skills and 
training that can quickly augment the local FBI field office‘s resources (see 
FBI memo:  FBI Response to Child Abductions, dated 12/1/2005). 

1. FBI resources and investigative personnel shall be used in conjunction 
with the Incident Command Structure as defined in this policy. 

E. If appropriate, consider activation of the Alaska Amber Alert system or 
other immediate community notification methods.  If circumstances indicate 
the chances for the person‘s survival would be increased by immediate public 
awareness, a supervisor should contact a commander and request an 
activation.  

F. If Patrol does not locate a child or an endangered adult missing under 
unusual circumstances within one to two hours of their initial response, 
consider establishing a basic Missing Person Incident Command System. 

G. Establish a command post if needed.  A command post is a field 
headquarters for scene management.  It is used as a center for organizing 
personnel and directing investigative efforts as well as a focal point for 
inquiries, intelligence gathering, and media contacts.  A command post 
should be established when the number of people at the scene exceeds the 
capability of the on-site supervisor‘s ability to exercise control.  The command 
post should not be located in the home of the missing person. 

H. Determine the Incident Commander position.  Contact the Patrol 
Commander and determine who will be the most likely candidate to be the 
Incident Commander.  The on scene supervisor will likely take the initial 
Incident Command position, however as the operation grows from a search 
and rescue operation to a search and investigate operation, the Incident 
Commander will move from being filled by patrol position to one held by an 
Investigation Supervisor or Commander.  There shall always be a single 
Incident Commander and they shall remain at the command post at all times 
as the scene commander until relieved and duties transferred to the next 
Incident Commander. 

I. Organize search and rescue efforts.  The supervisor should appoint an 
Operations Manager who can oversee operation resources, including the 
search effort while the supervisor remains available to manage the entire 
search operation. 

  

J. Organize Investigation efforts.  Contact the Homicide Commander or the 
Homicide Supervisor should appoint at least two investigators (Homicide, 
Missing Persons Investigator, and/or CACU Detective) who can oversee the 
criminal investigation while the Incident Commander remains available to 
manage the entire incident. 

K. Ensure that all required notifications have been made.  Because 
dissemination of information is an integral part of the search for a missing 
person, the supervisor should ensure that all officers, other departments and 
agencies, and all investigative networks are supplied with accurate details.  

L. Establish a liaison with the missing person‘s family.  Families of a missing 
person will experience extreme stress.  Supervisors should establish a liaison 
with the family who can explain what investigative actions are being employed 
and what they can do to assist in the search.  

M. Supervise the situation.  In addition to providing the necessary direction 
required in a missing person investigation, the supervisor also ensures that 
policies and procedures are adhered to.  

N. Manage media relations.  Many missing-person investigations, especially 
those involving large-scale efforts, are likely to draw media attention and may 
create added confusion for a supervisor at an already turbulent scene.  The 
supervisor should request that the Public Information and Community 
Relations Unit (PICRU) send someone to be the media liaison.  

O. If the investigation would be aided by the immediate broadcast of the 
person‘s description and photograph, a press conference held at the 
command post will be of value.  Broadcast the Department‘s telephone 
number (786-8900) for use by individuals who have information on the case.  

IV. DETECTIVE COMMANDER‘S RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Upon receiving notification of a missing person or child under unusual 
circumstances, the Detective Commander shall: 

1. Contact the Patrol Supervisor or the current Incident Commander for a 
situational briefing. 

2. Based upon the information known at the time, the Commander will 
contact the appropriate supervisor and assure that at least two(2) 
Detectives are assigned from either/or: 

a). Homicide 

b). Crimes Against Children 

c). The Missing Person Investigator 

3. One of the investigators shall be designated as the Case Officer. 

4. If the situation warrants that a higher level of response or that the 
situation appears to be moving from a search and rescue to a search and 
investigate operation then: 

  

a). Designate an Incident Commander from within the Detective 
Division to respond to the scene/Incident Command Post and take 
over the Incident Commander responsibilities.  There shall always be a 
single Incident Commander and he or she shall remain at the 
command post at all times as the scene commander until relieved and 
duties transferred to the next Incident Commander. 

V. DETECTIVE‘S RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. The responding detective(s) will report to the Incident Commander. 

B. The case detective(s) is responsible for the investigative assessment and 
coordination of any criminal investigation. The Case Detective will work with 
the Incident Commander who is responsible for overseeing the search 
operations and resource management. 

C. In addition, the Case Detective will be responsible for communicating 
investigative needs to the Incident Commander or a designated Operation 
Manager. 

D. Debrief first responders.  The detective(s) assigned to the report of a 
missing person under unusual circumstances shall be responsible for 
debriefing the first responders.  This briefing should be conducted prior to 
interviews with family members of the missing person or witnesses identified 
during the initial stage of the investigation.  Its objective is to assist the 
detective(s) in formulating effective interview and case strategies.  

E. Interview witnesses.  After interviewing family members, neighbors, 
witnesses, and other individuals, detectives should ―compare notes‖ with the 
first responder(s), immediate supervisor, and other department personnel 
who have had contact with the persons interviewed.  This collaborative 
evaluation will provide the investigative staff with a solid foundation upon 
which to structure future case direction.  

F. Verify the accuracy of all descriptive information.  

G. Conduct a neighborhood canvass.  A thorough canvass of the 
neighborhood should be conducted without delay.  The objective is to identify 
all persons within the abduction zone who may be able to provide information 
related to the incident.  Investigators should use a standardized set of 
questions to ensure completeness and uniformity of information and facilitate 
establishment of a database to track leads.  Consider making a video 
recording of the area to fully document the current conditions.  The new video 
could be compared to older photos or videos to determine if changes are 
noted. Access should also be made as soon as practical to the Sex Offender 
Registration list to determine if sexual predators reside, work, or might 
otherwise be associated with the area.  Access can be made to the registry 
through the State of Alaska web site at www.dps.state.ak.us. 

H. Obtain a brief history of recent family dynamics from persons at the scene, 
and verify, to the extent possible, the accuracy of that information.  Such 
information can offer valuable insights as to what may have happened to the 

  

person and/or where the person may now be located.  Neighbors, teachers, 
classmates, employers, coworkers, and witnesses can offer valuable insights 
into what may have happened.  The Office of Children‘s Services (OCS) and 
any other relevant social service agencies should also be contacted and 
records obtained and evaluated. 

I. Implement effective case management.  An information-management 
system is an essential part of the overall investigative process.  Depending on 
the resources available, information may either be computerized or 
incorporated in a simple card system.  Both methods are used to record, 
index, cross-reference, and retrieve the facts amassed during an 
investigation.  The method does not matter as long as the system works for 
the investigator in charge of solving the case.  In a large, ongoing 
investigation, a single detective may be designated to be a case management 
officer, who is responsible for incoming information, leads and case 
management. 

J. Evaluate the need for additional resources and specialized services.  The 
complexity of many missing-person incidents may necessitate the use of 
resources and services both from within the Department and from other 
organizations as well.  Investigators should be aware of the input that can be 
obtained from resources such as the FBI; NCIC; state missing children‘s 
clearinghouses; and National Center for Missing & Exploited Children 
(NCMEC), in particular Team Adam, which is a rapid-response team of 
experienced law-enforcement investigators available at no cost.  

K. Update descriptive information.  If it appears that the case will not be 
promptly resolved, investigators should ensure that the descriptive record, 
especially that entered into the NCIC Missing Person File is updated to 
include dental characteristics, scars, marks, tattoos, and fingerprints along 
with additional articles of clothing, jewelry, or unique possessions.  

L. Monitor media relations.  While information gained through effective media 
relations is often of significant value in a missing-child case, investigators 
should review all notices prior to release to ensure that investigative 
objectives are not unintentionally compromised. 

VI. INCIDENT COMMANDER‘S (IC) RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. All incidents, regardless of size of complexity, will have an Incident 
Commander. 

B. The command function is directed by the Incident Commander, who is the 
person in charge at the incident, and who must be fully qualified to manage 
the incident. 

C. In small-scale incidents, all of the components may be managed by one 
person, the Incident Commander (IC).  The Incident Commander can initially 
be any Supervisor, including a patrol Supervisor, who takes command. 

  

D. As an incident grows, the IC shall delegate authority for performing certain 
activities, transfer of command, and establish the other command positions as 
needed. 

E. As the incident moves from a Patrol based search and rescue to a 
Detective based search and investigation incident the Incident commander 
will likely be the Homicide Supervisor or may be designated by the Detective 
Commander or their designee. 

F. In a 24-hour-a-day Incident Command Center, there will always be an 
Incident Commander present. 

G. The priorities for the Incident Commander are: 

1. Life Safety:  The safety of the emergency responders and the public. 

2. Incident Stability:  to maximize the response effort while using 
resources efficiently. 

3. Establishment of the Incident Command Post 

a). Considerations of establishing an incident Command Post include: 

i. Proximity to operation assignments 

ii. Proximity to possible hazards 

iii. Access Routes 

iv. Space 

v. Security 

b). The incident command post should not be located in the home of 
the missing person. 

H. In large-scale incidents usually require that each component, or section, is 
set up separately and each is run by a manager (Operations, Investigations, 
Logistics, Finance, and Planning) 

1. Operations Manager 

a). Responsible for carrying out response activities based upon search 
and investigative requests 

b). Direct and Coordinate all operations 

c). Request resources through the Incident Commander 

d). Maintain operational information and communicate Operations 
Activities status to the IC and IC Staff 

e). Designate single Branch Mangers to oversee resource groups such 
as 

i. APD Search Team Coordinator 

ii. Auxiliary Search Teams 

  

iii. Tip Line Call takers 

iv. Patrol 

v. Detectives 

vi. K9 

vii. Helo/Air Search 

2. Communicate with the Branch Managers and maintain a proper flow of 
information to the IC and the case detective. 

a). Investigations 

i. An investigation is the responsibility of the case detective. 

ii. In lengthy investigations, there will need to be two primary 
investigators who can work in shifts. 

iii. Investigations will work with the IC and Operations to coordinate 
operational needs of the investigation while still allowing search 
efforts to continue simultaneously. 

3. Logistics Manager 

a). Responsible for providing facilities, services, and materials 
including locating and locating and directing personnel resources to 
Operations Manger. 

4. Finance Manager 

a). In large scale and long term operations a person shall be 
designated to oversee the tracking of costs and accounting for 
reimbursements. 

5. Planning Manager 

a). Responsible for collecting, evaluating, and dissemination of 
information regarding the incident and the status of resources. 

b). Responsible for creating ongoing Incident Action Plans (IAP) and 
making the information available during shift handoffs and other 
briefings. 

I. In addition, the Incident Commander may need to establish: 

1. 24 hour/12 hours shifts and hand off procedures for the case 
detective(s), Incident Commander, and other critical positions such as 
Operations, Logistics, and Planning positions.

VII. RECOVERED MISSING PERSONS 

A. Runaways.  Should officers locate a runaway, the following steps should 
be followed: 

 

1. As with a warrant service, ensure: 

a). The individual suspected of runaway status is fully identified; and 

b). that the minor is, in fact, on runaway status.  

2. Officers are reminded that even protective custody allows for response 
to resistance, both for officer safety and to effect custody.  See ―Response 
to Resistance‖ (3.05.025) 

3. Once the confirmed runaway is in protective custody, the officer must 
comply with Alaska Statute 47.10.141(b) (1) and any other applicable 
provisions of Title 47. 
http://touchngo.com/lglcntr/akstats/Statutes/Title47/Chapter10/Section141.
htm 

  

4. Officers will occasionally encounter legal custodians who will refuse to 
accept custody of the minor, as well as minors who will refuse to be 
placed with the legal custodian or in a location designated by Health and 
Social Services.  In those cases, the officer will: 

a). Advise the social worker of the situation and carry out the 
instructions given; 

b). Consider advising the minor that refusal to accept available care 
can subject him/her to Family Court jurisdiction, and that leaving court 
ordered placement may result in criminal contempt charges.  

5. Officers are encouraged to investigate the circumstances surrounding 
the runaway and any events occurring while on runaway status.  Runaway 
is often symptomatic of other problems, and officers may obtain leads on 
more substantial criminal activities.  

6. A supplement to the original Missing Person/Runaway Report shall be 
completed and notification of an NCIC/APSIN operator is required to 
remove the subject from the computer.  If a new case number is going to 
be drawn reference the contact with the Runaway, the officer still has to 
complete a Supplement to the original report. 

7. A supplement to the original Missing Person/Runaway Report shall be 
completed and notification of an NCIC/APSIN operator is required to 
remove the subject from the computer.  If a new case number is going to 
be drawn reference the contact with the Runaway, the officer still has to 
complete a Supplement to the original report. 

a). Officers will ask juveniles the following questions when completing 
a runaway recovery supplement: 

i.. When you ran away: 

(1). Where did you go? 

(2). Who were you with? 

(3). Did anyone do anything to hurt you? 

ii. Can you tell me why you ran away? 

iii. Is anyone where you are supposed to be living hurting you? 

iv. Is anyone where you are supposed to be living touching you in 
ways that make you feel uncomfortable? 

v. If you are returned to where you are supposed to be living will 
you run away again? 

(4). What would have to change to keep you from running away 
again? 

b). If the answers yield information that requires an immediate 
response, officers will handle it as a new criminal case and take 
appropriate action. 

  

7. All supplemental reports made about a missing/runaway juvenile should 
be referred to the Office of Children‘s Services for their review.  This can 
be done by leaving a telephone message with the answering service 
(currently 269-4000) and providing them with the officer‘s name and DSN, 
the case number, and a brief description of the circumstances and the 
involved parties.  

a). If the recovered runaway alleges to be a victim of a new crime, or is 
a recovered habitual runaway, the officer shall contact OCS and make 
a Protective Services Report. 

B. Adults.  Should officers locate an adult who is the subject of a Missing 
Person report, the officer shall: 

1. Verify that the located person is, in fact, the reported missing person. 

2. Inform the located person that he or she is the subject of a missing 
person investigation.  Unless the officer has reason to believe that the 
located person is not a competent adult, the officer shall determine the 
person‘s willingness for the police to reveal his or her whereabouts.  To 
the extent possible, a person‘s desire to remain hidden shall be honored.  

3. Notify the initial reporting person(s) of the well-being and, if the located 
person consents, the physical whereabouts and contact information of the 
person who has been located.  

4. A Supplement to the original Missing Person report shall be completed 
and notification of an NCIC/APSIN operator is required to remove the 
subject from the computer.  If a new case number is going to be drawn 
reference the contact with the Missing Person, the officer still has to 
complete a Supplement to the original report.

with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.01.050  Sexual Assault Response 

To instruct all sworn officers of the Anchorage Police Department on the 
procedures regarding the investigation of sexual assaults. 

That all reports of sexual assaults be investigated promptly and thoroughly to 
enhance the likelihood of prosecution, and in a manner so as to maintain the 
dignity of the victim. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

Because of the extremely sensitive and personal nature of sexual assaults and 
the widely ranging sets of emotions exhibited by the victims of sexual assault, 
great care should be taken by investigating officers to avoid judging the validity of 
an assault report based on the victim's demeanor.  Delays in reporting such an 
assault should not be deemed indicative of a false claim.  A lack of emotion and 
delay in reporting a sexual assault are both symptoms of Rape Trauma 
Syndrome which are commonly mistaken as indicators of insincerity or false 
accusations.  Officers taking the initial report should strive to remain neutral in 
their judgment while remaining supportive of the victim's emotional needs.  A 
complete and thorough investigation of all known facts must be done before a 
determination of validity can be made. 

In reviewing the statutes, one finds eleven distinct categories of sexual assault.  
Each has particular elements which must be present to constitute that form of 
sexual assault.  A thorough understanding of the terms used and their definitions 
is essential to properly identifying and prosecuting any crime, especially sexual 
assault. 

Sexual Contact:  The defendant's knowingly touching, directly or through 
clothing, the victim's genitals, anus, or female breast; or knowingly causing the 

DEFINITIONS 

 

  

victim to touch, directly or through clothing, the defendant's or victim's genitals, 
anus, or female breasts but does not include acts that may reasonably be 
construed to be normal caretaker responsibilities for a child, interactions with a 
child, or affection for a child, or acts performed for the purpose of administering a 
recognized and lawful form of treatment that is reasonably adapted to promote 
the physical or mental health of a person being treated. [AS 11.81.900 (b)(58)]. 

Sexual Penetration:  Genital intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, or 
an intrusion of an object or any part of a person's body into the genital or anal 
opening of another, but does not include acts performed to administer a 
recognized and lawful form of treatment reasonably adapted to promote the 
physical health of the person being treated. [AS 11.81.900 (b)(53)]. 

Serious Physical Injury:  Physical injury caused by an act performed under 
circumstances that create a substantial risk of death, or physical injury that 
causes serious and protracted disfigurement, protracted impairment of health, 
protracted loss or impairment of the function of a body member or organ, or that 
unlawfully terminates a pregnancy. [AS 11.81.900 (b)(50)]. 

Without Consent:  When a person, with or without resisting, is coerced by the use 
of force against a person or property, or by the express or implied threat of death, 
kidnapping, or imminent physical injury to anyone, or is incapacitated as a result 
of an act by the defendant.  [AS 11.41.470 (3)]. 

Attempt:  With intent to commit a crime, engages in conduct which constitutes a 
substantial step towards commission of that crime.  [AS 11.31.100(a)].

PROCEDURES 

I. JURISDICTION 

A. Anchorage Police Department's Responsibility.  The Anchorage Police 
Department is responsible for: 

1. Any sexual assault occurring within the Police Service Area; and 

2. Any sexual assault occurring outside the Police Service Area but was 
precipitated by events occurring within the Police Service Area which 
caused the victim to be taken from the Service Area by means of 
deception or coercion for the purposes of sexually assaulting the victim. 

B. Exceptions to Jurisdiction.  Because of overlapping areas of 
responsibilities, there are exceptions to the jurisdictions cited above.  
Although these locations are within the Anchorage Police Service Area, the 
Department does not have primary responsibility for investigating sexual 
assaults that occur there.  These locations include: 

  

1. State Correctional Facilities. 

2. Military Reservations except when civilians are involved. 

3. Alaska State Courthouse (except that the parking lot is APD‘s 
jurisdiction). 

II. OFFICERS' RESPONSIBILITIES--INITIAL 

A. Medical Attention.  As with any assault case, an officer‘s initial concern is 
the physical welfare of the victim.  If medical attention is required or sought, 
officers shall ensure that victims are expeditiously transported to the medical 
facility of their choice.   

B. Preliminary Interview.  The preliminary interview is to establish the 
following: 

1. Determine what occurred to compare the actual events to the elements 
necessary in establishing sexual assault as the crime; and 

2. When it occurred; and 

3. How force was applied; and 

4. Where it occurred; and 

5. Who the assailant was, including a physical description; and 

6. Any suspect vehicle description; and 

7. Any possible location of the assailant; and 

8. The identity and/or location of any witnesses. 

C. Taped Interviews of Victim.  Officers shall obtain a taped interview with 
victims as soon as practical, keeping in mind their emotional state.   

D. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.   

E. Broadcast of Information.  If warranted, officers shall broadcast a locate for 
the assailant based on the information provided in the preliminary interview.  
Officers should consider not broadcasting a locate if the case will require 
supporting information through a ―glass warrant‖ conversation with the victim. 

III. OFFICERS' RESPONSIBILITIES--INVESTIGATION 

A. Departmental Notifications.  The general interview may reveal facts 
necessitating immediate notification(s) within the Department.  Should any of 
the following conditions exist, notification is required as described: 

1. If the victim is 16 years of age or older, notify the Supervisor of the 
Special Victim‘s Unit; or 

2. If the victim is 15 years of age or younger, notify the Supervisor of 
Crimes against Children Unit.  However, 

  

3. If any Departmental notification is required but the appropriate Unit 
Supervisor is not available, then notify the Lieutenant commanding the 
Sexual Assault Units. 

4. Officers may be required, at the direction of the Detective Unit 
Supervisor, to transport victims to the SART center. 

B. Other Notifications.  Officers may have other notifications to make as well. 
Depending on the circumstances, these could include: 

1. "Standing Together Against Rape" (S.T.A.R).  Note the following: 

a). Advisement.  Officers shall advise victims that the organization 
"S.T.A.R." is a free service available at all times. 

b). Notification.  If the services of "S.T.A.R." are requested, officers 
shall make or cause to make such notification. 

2. Victim's requests.  Should the victim request any other notifications be 
made, officers shall make all reasonable efforts to comply.  They might 
suggest family, friends, or others who could provide emotional support. 

C. Interviews.  If Detectives do not respond, it is the Patrol Officer's 
responsibility to prepare the case.  Central to this is taking statements.  
Officers shall record all statements made by witnesses, suspects and victims. 
Be especially mindful of the value of separating the interviewees: 

1. Victims may be reluctant to discuss the event if someone they know is 
present (if, however, they are uncomfortable alone, it would be proper to 
allow the presence of a supporting friend or family member). 

2. Witnesses must relate their independent observations, not the collective 
thoughts of a group interview. 

3. Suspects must be given their full Constitutional protections if a custodial 
interview is conducted. 

D. Information.  In completing the field report, officers must include sufficient 
personal data on all persons to facilitate later contact and to identify unknown 
persons. 

E. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.   

VI. PREPARATION OF EVIDENCE. 

A. Sexual Assault Protocol Kit.  The kit should not be accepted from the 
medical staff until properly sealed.  It should contain whole blood, which 
requires that the entire, unopened kit be placed and logged into the APD 
evidence refrigerator as soon as possible.   

Note:  Supervisors have keys to enter that area after normal hours.  The 
Protocol kit must not be allowed to freeze, nor be exposed to heat (such as 
being near the car's interior heater). 

  

B. Clothing.  Officers shall enter each piece of clothing into evidence under 
separate evidence tags.  Wet clothes or other moist items must be properly 
dried in the evidence drying area before being submitted.  

1. Damp items will not be placed in plastic bags.  Use paper bags as 
provided (see Property and Evidence procedures). 

C. Suspect evidence collection kit (if applicable).  Every item specified in this 
kit, plus all other items seized as evidence, shall be individually bagged and 
tagged. 

D. Blood-infused material shall be submitted to the Property Section in 
accordance with the provisions outlined in the "Hazardous Property" portion 
of the Property and Evidence procedures.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.01.055  Anonymous Reporting of Sexual Assault 

To advise all employees of the procedures regarding the anonymous reporting of 
sexual assaults. 

PURPOSE 

DISCUSSION 

The intent of the US Violence Against Women Act (VAWA 2005), which 
mandated anonymous or restricted reporting policy, is to allow victims of sexual 
assault time to decide whether or not to pursue their cases and still allow for the 
collection of forensic evidence from the victim.  Being an extremely traumatic 
event, some sexual assault victims are unable to decide immediately whether 
they want to cooperate with law enforcement.  Because forensic evidence can be 
lost as time progresses, such victims should be encouraged to have the evidence 
collected by submitting to a Sexual Assault Forensic Medical Examination (SART 
Exam) as soon as possible without being forced to decide to initiate a report to 
police. 

Anonymous reporting presents challenges to the SART program as well as to 
APD.  Non-law enforcement SANE nurses will perform triage on cases which 
were previously triaged by Special Victims Unit personnel.  The identity of the 
victim who chooses to report anonymously needs to be guarded.  The evidence 
gained still needs to be retained by APD in compliance with strict chain of 
custody requirements.  The victim needs to understand clearly that prosecution 
will be hindered greatly by significant delay in law enforcement‘s notification and 
investigation of the case. 

In order to comply with VAWA and to fulfill our mandate to investigate and 
prosecute sexual assault, the following procedures will be followed for 
anonymous reporting cases: 

For the purposes of this policy the following terms are defined as: 

DEFINITIONS 

  

Anonymous Reporting:  (Synonymous with Restricted Reporting)  Essentially, a 
report of sexual assault which is made enabling the victim to receive a Forensic 
Medical Exam at no cost to the victim and/or without requiring the victim to 
cooperate with police.  

Forensic Medical Examination:  ―An examination provided to a sexual assault 
victim by medical personnel trained to gather evidence of a sexual assault in a 
manner suitable for use in a court of law.‖ 

The examination should include at a minimum:  

1. Examination of physical trauma;  

2. Determination of penetration or force;  

3. Patient interview; and 

4. Collection and evaluation of evidence. 

The inclusion of additional procedures (e.g., testing for sexually transmitted 
diseases) to obtain evidence or provide treatment may be determined by the 
State in accordance with its current laws, policies, and practices.‖ DOJ Office of 
Violence Against Women publication: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON 
STOP FORMULA GRANTS; Updated November 21, 2007; p. 22. 

I. CASE SCREENING 

PROCEDURE 

A. Anonymous report cases will be directly screened by the SART Clinical 
Supervisor* or her designee according to triage standards established by 
Providence Hospital in accordance with the PROV-SART-1 Grant Agreement.   

1. The place in which the sexual assault took place shall be determined 
and SART personnel in turn shall comply with the policy of the responsible 
law enforcement agency which has jurisdiction in taking the anonymous 
report.  

2. Military restricted reports will be handled by military investigators. 

* APD SVU will assume the duties for triage in anonymous reporting cases if and when 
APD assumes responsibility for the grant administration or should APD become 
responsible for payment for SART exams. 

B. If a victim reports to Anchorage Police Department and then, at any point 
during the investigation or the exam, decides to not cooperate with law 
enforcement these cases will not be considered anonymous cases.  Cases 
previously triaged by APD will not be accepted for anonymous report forensic 
exam.  (This will not prevent SART from medically evaluating the reporter for 
referral to other medical providers.)  

C. The anonymous reporting option will not be offered to minors and 
vulnerable adults due to mandatory reporting requirements of Alaska 
Statutes. 

1. Minor is defined by AS 47.17.290(1) as 17 years of age or younger or;  

  

2. Vulnerable adult is defined by AS 47.24.900 (16). 

II. DOCUMENTATION 

A. When contacted by SART medical personnel with an anonymous report, 
Dispatch shall draw case numbers under the heading ―RAPEAN.‖  This APD 
case number will be communicated with the SANE for the purpose of cross 
reference. 

B. The SART case number shall be used in place of the victim‘s name on the 
report.  The report shall include only such general identifying information as to 
provide statistical data.  The following data will be found on the exterior of the 
Sexual Assault Protocol Kit including: 

1. Date and time of assault.  

2. General location (street/intersection) of the assault.  

3. Age of the victim.  

4. Race of the victim.  

5. Gender of the victim.  

Note: No suspect information will be provided or noted at this point in time.  
The suspect‘s identity will be determined if known to the victim when the 
victim reports to Police. 

C.  The body of the report shall state the time and date that the report was 
taken, the name of the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner from whom the report 
was taken and that the report is an anonymous report of sexual assault. 
(Sample Narrative:  On 5-8-08 at 1800 hours I responded to the SART Center 
and was informed by SANE Susan Smith that she had conducted a forensic 
medical examination on a victim identified by SART Case # 08-23.  I seized 
the evidence provided by SANE Smith and entered it into APD Evidence 
Section for storage,(End of Sample Narrative))  The case status shall be 
―Closed.‖ 

D. Detectives and patrol officers shall avoid contact with the victim unless the 
victim wishes to make a report to APD. 

E. SANE nurses shall focus their questioning of the victim to medically 
relevant issues as health care providers.  They shall not conduct a criminal 
investigation of any kind nor collect information regarding suspect identity 
(other than the name if known) or circumstances surrounding the sexual 
assault which do not have direct relevance to the health care issues of the 
victim or to the collection of evidence from the victim.  (See US Supreme 
Court Crawford Decision) 

III. EVIDENCE HANDLING 

A. When the Forensic Medical Examination is completed, the SANE will 
contact the SVU Supervisor, who will have a detective receive and place the 
evidence into APD Evidence and complete the original report. 

  

B. The sealed Sexual Assault Protocol Kit containing the evidence, a CD of 
the photographic evidence, and a completed Alaska State Crime Lab sexual 
assault evidence form as well as the victim‘s clothing and any other relevant 
evidence shall be seized from the SANE by the officer or detective and 
entered into APD Evidence Section according to the standard evidence 
submittal procedures.   

C. The victim‘s name will not be placed on the evidence submission form or 
on the exterior of any evidence-containing package.  Only the SART case 
number shall be used as a specific victim identifier. 

D. Anonymous reporting evidence shall not be opened, viewed or processed 
without the consent of the victim or by authority of Court order. 

E. APD Evidence Section will retain evidence from anonymous reports for 5 
years after which the evidence will be transferred to Alaska State Troopers for 
retention. 

IV. ANONYMOUS REPORT TO UNRESTRICTED REPORT 

A. SART, STAR (Standing Together Against Rape) or the victim themselves 
may contact Dispatch to make known the desire of the victim to cooperate 
with police and make a report of the sexual assault.  

B.  If the call is made during duty hours, Dispatch will contact the Special 
Victims Unit supervisor to have a detective take the report; if not during duty 
hours a patrol officer will be dispatched.  The case will be triaged like any 
other sexual assault case at that point.  The fact that an anonymous report 
has been made will not affect the case triage.  If the case warrants an 
immediate response by detectives, that decision will be made by the Special 
Victims Unit supervisor or his/her designee. 

C. The case will then be pursued as any other sexual assault case.

3.01.060  Stolen- Recovered Vehicles 

To advise all personnel of the approved methods of both accepting reports of 
stolen vehicles and processing recovered stolen vehicles. 

PURPOSE 

PROCEDURE 

I. METHODS OF ACCEPTING REPOORTS OF STOLEN 

A. Telephone Reports.  Most commonly, reports of stolen vehicles are 
forwarded to the Records Section where they are opened.  In these cases, 
the following applies: 

1. Clerks taking the report shall check all available records to ensure that 
the vehicle was not impounded by the police or a private person, nor was 
the subject of a civil repossession. 

2. Clerks receiving the call shall process the report as follows: 

a). Complete the Police Report. 

b). Enter, or cause to be entered, all required stolen vehicle information 
(including all telephone numbers where the complainant can be 
reached.) into the APSIN/NCIC and Police computer systems. 

c). Forward a copy of the report to the appropriate follow-up section.  

B. In-Person Reports.  When a person appears at the Anchorage Police 
Station to report a vehicle as stolen, the same procedure as a telephoned 
report prevails. 

C. Dispatched Reports.  When officers take a report of a stolen vehicle in the 
field, the following applies: 

1. Screen the complaint for veracity/foundation.  

2. Complete the Police Report.  

  

3. Notify the Dispatch Center to enter all required stolen vehicle 
information (including the complainant's home and work telephone 
numbers) into the APSIN/NCIC and Police computer systems. 

4. If appropriate, have the Dispatch Center broadcast a locate for the 
vehicle(s). 

5. Document the vehicle entry number and the DSN of the computer 
operator on the Police Report. 

D. "Failure to Return" Vehicles.  Complaints that are determined to be "failure 
to return" situations may be civil problems.  For a full discussion, see the Civil 
Issues Policy. 

II. DISPATCH CENTER‘S RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Broadcast appropriate locates. 

B. If there is a likelihood of recoverable evidence; Dispatch will send a unit to 
the scene.  

C. Assign case numbers as required to officers. 

D. Enter the stolen vehicle information into the state-wide computer system 
as soon as practical. 

III. RECOVERY OF STOLEN VEHICLES 

A. Methods of Recovery.  Anchorage Police typically become involved in 
recovery of stolen vehicles through two sources--investigation/field discovery, 
or through an owner recovery.  In either event, the following applies: 

1. Police Recovery.  When officers discover a stolen vehicle, they shall:  

a). Describe all events and actions on a Supplemental Report using 
the original Police Report number.  Include vehicle description, license 
number, and/or the vehicle identification number.  

b).Make all reasonable attempts to contact the owner.  In the event 
contact cannot be made, or if the owner cannot/will not respond, the 
vehicle shall be impounded for safekeeping.  (See the Towing--
Impounds Policy for details). 

c). If additional crimes have been committed, and the investigating 
officer has reason to believe that these crimes are independent of the 
vehicle theft, new case numbers shall be drawn and a criminal case 
processed as normal, cross-referencing the two cases.  

d). Processing for evidence will be accomplished in accordance with 
Department procedures, to include, but not limited to, recovery of items 
not belonging to the owner of the vehicle, swabbing for DNA, and 
attempting to lift latent prints. 

e). The Dispatch Center shall be advised to remove the vehicle from 
stolen status.  The DSN of the operator removing the vehicle from 
stolen status shall be documented in the recovery narrative. 

  

2. Owner Recovery.  When owners retrieve their own vehicle, an officer 
will conduct an investigation as described in ―a.‖ above. 

B. Dispatch Center‘s Responsibilities.  Regardless of the method of recovery, 
Dispatch Center shall: 

1. Dispatch a unit to investigate unless some compelling reason exists 
precluding this requirement.  

2. Cancel the stolen vehicle in accordance with current Unit procedures.

3.01.070  Resisting Arrest 

To advise all personnel of the proper application of the State Statute and 
Municipal Ordinances governing resisting officers. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

That members of the Department apply the provisions of the resisting officer laws 
narrowly, avoiding arrests based solely on a subject's lack of cooperation, 
rudeness, failure to provide identification, or challenge to the officer's authority. 

AS 11.56.700. Resisting or interfering with arrest.   

REFERENCES 

A person commits the crime of resisting or interfering with arrest if, knowing that 
a peace officer is making an arrest, the person resists personal arrest or 
interferes with the arrest of another by: 

1. Force; 

2. Committing any degree of criminal mischief; or 

3. Any means that creates a substantial risk of physical injury to any person. 

AMC 8.05.530 Resisting Officer. 

A person commits the crime of resisting or interfering with a peace officer when 

1. The person intentionally, recklessly, or knowingly delays or obstructs the 
person's own arrest by the use of force; 

2. The person intentionally, recklessly, or knowingly delays or obstructs the 
arrest of another by the use of force; 

3. The person intentionally, recklessly, or knowingly delays or obstructs the 
person's arrest by fleeing, hiding, engaging in a stand-off, or barricading 
himself; 

  

4. The person intentionally, recklessly, or knowingly delays or obstructs a 
police officer's active investigation of a crime by fleeing after having been told 
to stop; 

5. The person intentionally, recklessly or knowingly resists, obstructs or 
interferes with the lawful efforts of any firefighter or paramedic in the 
discharge or attempted discharge of an official duty; 

6. The person intentionally, recklessly or knowingly disobeys the lawful orders 
of any public officer; or 

7. The person intentionally or recklessly engages in conduct which delays or 
prevents a fire from being timely extinguished or emergency services from 
being provided. 

8. It is unlawful for any person to intentionally injure, destroy, take or attempt 
to take personal property from the custody of any public officer or person 
which is possessed by process of law. 

AMC 9.28.011 Failing to Stop or Attempting to Elude a Police Officer. 

It is unlawful for the driver of any vehicle to willfully fail or refuse to bring the 
vehicle to a stop, or attempt to elude a pursuing police officer or police vehicle, 
when given visual or audible signal to bring the vehicle to a stop by a police 
officer.  If the police officer is not in a vehicle, the signal given by such police 
officer shall be by hand or voice, and the police officer must be in uniform or 
otherwise be clearly identifiable as a police officer.  If the police officer is in a 
vehicle, the visual signal shall be by flashing red or red and blue lights, and the 
audible signal shall be by emergency siren. 

I. GENERAL 

PROCEDURES 

A. Establishing the Offense.  The most critical aspect of charging resisting is 
to ensure that the amount and type of resisting done by the subject was 
substantial enough to warrant arrest.  Once established, however, the 
investigation of any remaining elements constituting the crime are 
conventional. 

B. Insufficient Resisting and Alternate Charges.  Should officers determine 
that the person's conduct did not meet the level required for an arrest under 
the Municipal Ordinance of resisting officer; an alternate charge might be 
considered.  Since "resisting an officer" is so general, officers would be wise 
to consider a more specific, descriptive charge.  The following charges are 
typical of those acts committed to resist or interfere with officers which have 
their own particular section to charge under: 

1. Assault (on a police officer) 

2. Disorderly Conduct 

3. Failure to Yield to an Emergency Vehicle (traffic citation) 

  

C. Failing to Identify-Alternatives to Arrest.  Officers not only have the 
authority, but in fact the duty to investigate suspicious circumstances.  The 
primary element of that investigation is to fully identify the people involved.  
Since officers are not able to arrest solely for failing to identify one's self, 
other investigative techniques must be considered.  The following is offered 
as an aid to officers confronted with such a situation: 

1. Generally, people will identify themselves.  The procedure "Custody--
Field Interviews" discusses various methods of enhancing voluntary 
compliance. 

2. If driving, the driver must furnish an operator's license for identification. 

3. When standards are met, the officer may photograph the subject(s).  

D. Blending Charges.  As with any other charging situation, the blending of 
State and Municipal charges must be avoided. 

II. OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE MUNICIPLE RESISTING ORDINANCE 

AMC 8.30.010, paragraph B. This section defines "public officer." 

AMC 9.28.011.  This section of the Municipal traffic code addresses vehicle 
operators who elude the police.  The ordinance requires willfully disregarding the 
visual or audible signal to stop.  To charge: 

If officers are not in a vehicle, then officers must be in uniform or otherwise 
clearly identifiable as a police officer;  

-OR- 

If officers are in a vehicle, the vehicle must display flashing red or red and 
blue lights, and produce audible signal by use of the emergency siren.

employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a

with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.01.075  Civil Issues 

To advise all personnel of their responsibilities and limitations when requested to 
assist in civil matters. 

When confronted with civil problems employees will remain neutral in their 
attitudes and acts, but take all reasonable steps to preserve public tranquility, 
ensure safety, and assist the parties in the possible resolution of the conflict. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DEFINITIONS 

Civil:  In this procedure, the term "civil" refers to those matters affecting the 
private rights of individuals and businesses, and the processes which protect and 
adjudicate those issues.  This can be contrasted with other bodies of law, most 
notably "criminal."  Civil sanctions include fines and forfeiture of property, but 
specifically exclude the criminal sanctions of imprisonment and/or record(s) of 
conviction. 

I. IDENTIFICATION OF CIVIL ISSUES 

PROCEDURE 

A. Criminal Statutes Prevail.  The first test in establishing whether an issue is 
civil or criminal is to determine if the act(s) is/are covered by criminal law.  If 
so, it shall be handled as a criminal matter. 

B. Civil and Criminal Mixes.  A complex scenario can include both civil and 
criminal issues.  Officers must be alert to this possibility, and be careful in the 
assessment of what police action to take. 

C. Escalation.  Civil matters can escalate to criminal.  Again, officers must be 
alert to this possibility and distinguish between the various and complex 
issues surrounding the event. 

  

D. Civil Orders.  Legitimate civil court documents specifying the Anchorage 
Police Department as the enforcement agency shall be enforced.  The 
Judicial Services branch of the Alaska State Troopers enforces all other civil 
court documents, including those addressed ―to any peace officer‖. 

II. TYPES OF CIVIL ISSUES 

A. Most Common Types of Civil Issues.  Officers will routinely be faced with 
the following types of civil calls: 

1. Domestic Violence Writs are a special restraining order authorized by 
the court.  Securing such a Writ is done civilly, but breach of the provisions 
is considered criminal. 

2. Civil Standbys are requested by people who have to conduct business 
with a person, and are concerned that control might be lost and criminal 
conduct (assault, vandalism, etc.) might occur if the police are not present.  
Civil standbys are the most common type of civil problem encountered, 
and the material discussed in this procedure should guide officers. 

3. Property repossession by a creditor is a purely civil matter, and the role 
of officers is normally limited to that of a civil standby.  Recall that civil 
documents are typically enforced by the Judicial Services branch of the 
Alaska State Troopers unless the document specifically addresses the 
Anchorage Police Department.  Officers should honor legitimate court 
documents, which entitle a party to specified property or actions.  Since 
police are rarely trained in recognizing and interpreting civil documents 
(other than a few specific ones, such as Domestic Violence Writs), it is 
often difficult to decide what action to take.  When confronted with an 
unfamiliar or questionable civil document, a Supervisor should be called to 
assist in interpreting that document and investigating its veracity.  If the 
document is valid, officers are obligated to take whatever action is 
appropriate to enforce the civil court order. 

4. Impounds are civil in nature, including private person impounds, and 
require the police only to preserve the peace.  More information on 
impounds can be found in the procedure "Towing--Impounds". 

III. RESPONSIBILITIES IN CIVIL ISSUES 

A. Preservation of Peace and Protection of Property.  Officers shall take all 
reasonable steps to preserve the public peace and protect property. 

B. Neutrality.  Officers shall maintain a neutral position to the civil issues. 

C. Use Least Intrusive Approach.  In handling civil issues, officers should first 
consider the least intrusive approach. 

1. "Freezing" the situation (i.e., preserving the status quo) obligates the 
parties involved to seek legal authority to take any further action, and is 
often the best course to take.  This relieves officers from having to 
arbitrarily decide who gets what; however, 

  

2. If there is clear evidence to show legal entitlement (based on the best 
information available to officers in the field), officers must honor the legal 
rights of the parties involved.  This can mean not "freezing the situation" 
as recommended above, but instead taking affirmative action on behalf of 
the entitled party.  However, civil standbys for the purpose of bill collection 
shall not be conducted, regardless of proof of entitlement. 

D. Time of Day Considerations.  Employees must weigh the urgency of the 
issue against the inconvenience imposed on the parties.  Middle-of-the-night 
interruptions may not be warranted, for instance, if the objective is retrieval of 
non-essential items.  In most cases, officers should defer any request for a 
civil standby between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. to a supervisor 
for approval. 

E. Duration of Call.  Officers can incur substantial out-of-service time in 
resolving a civil problem if reasonable restraints and limits are not imposed.  
In general, if the call appears to require more than 30 minutes, a Supervisor 
should be advised. 

F. Rendering Assistance to the Parties.  A neutral position, and a position of 
minimum intrusion, does not preclude officers from assisting in the resolution 
of the conflict.  Referral to appropriate agencies, explaining the processes 
involved, and offering information and suggestions does not necessarily 
compromise neutrality, and indeed is a service usually sought and expected 
by the public. 

IV. "FAILURE TO RETURN‖ VEHICLES 

A. A vehicle theft report will not be taken under the following circumstances: 

1. The person who took the vehicle was given permission by the 
registered owner to use the vehicle; or 

2. The person who took the vehicle is known to the complainant (e.g., an 
estranged or angry partner or intoxicated or irresponsible friend or other 
acquaintance) and that person regularly uses the vehicle; or 

3. The person to whom the vehicle was loaned failed to return the vehicle. 

B. A vehicle theft report may be filed under the following circumstances: 

1. The vehicle was taken by a person unknown to the complainant; or 

2. The vehicle was taken by a person known to the complainant, but who 
had no reasonable expectation to believe that permission was granted to 
use the vehicle; or 

3. A vehicle has not been returned in violation of a written contract, and 
seven (7) days have elapsed since the specified return date of that 
vehicle; or 

4. A vehicle that was lent to, borrowed, or otherwise taken by a person 
known to the complainant has not been returned, and seven (7) days have 
elapsed since the specified return date of that vehicle; or 

  

5. A vehicle was taken on a test drive from an auto dealership or from a 
private party, and has not been returned by the end of the business day. 

6. Whenever there is doubt as to the status of a vehicle that has not been 
returned to an owner and a reasonable determination cannot be made, the 
vehicle shall be classified as stolen. 

7. Vehicles classified as "failure to return" shall not be broadcasted as 
"vehicle locates" for officers, except in those cases where the public may 
be endangered by the actions or condition of the drivers involved.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.01.080 Littering 

To advise all personnel of the various statutes and ordinances governing littering, 
and the proper method of enforcing those laws. 

That members respond to detected violations of the littering laws by charging the 
most descriptive ordinance/statute on the proper charging document. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

The laws governing littering fall into three general categories: 

1) Persons who litter,  

2) Vehicular/traffic littering,  

3) Illegal dumping/unauthorized use of dumpsters.  

Depending on which violation is charged, the offense can be an infraction (written 
on a Uniform Summons and Complaint form, just as a traffic infraction would be 
charged), or as a misdemeanor, charged by arrest with appearance before the 
Magistrate, or by way of a Misdemeanor Citation, as the situation would suggest.  
Officers, therefore, must be acquainted with the various littering laws, and 
determine which one best describes the event.  This procedure identifies the 
various laws, their application, and charging methods. 

REFERENCES 

The following laws are discussed in the procedures section below, and appear in 
the order shown here. 

AS 46.06.080 (a).  Infraction to litter (5 pounds or less).

I. APPLICABLE LAWS 

PROCEDURE 

A. State Statutes.  The applicable Alaska State Statute is AS 46.06.080.  
Subparagraph (a) makes it illegal for a person to throw, drop, discard, or 
otherwise dispose of litter from a vehicle or otherwise on public or private 
property not designated as a litter receptacle or sanitation facility.  
Subparagraph ―(b)‖ of that same Statute makes it illegal to litter as a result of 
a vehicle‘s load dropping, shifting, leaking, or otherwise escaping (i.e. a 
―reckless‖ or ―negligent‖ littering. Subparagraph ―(b)‖ is the equivalent to AMC 
9.46.060 A.).  Note that both ―(a)‖ and ―(b)‖ are infractions, if the aggregate 
amount is 5 pounds or less, but criminal if the aggregate amount is more than 
5 pounds. 

B. Municipal ordinances.  All Municipal Ordinances regarding littering are 
infractions.  The following is a list of associated Municipal Ordinances, with a 
brief synopsis of what they prohibit: 

1. AMC 9.36.100 A.  ―No person may throw or deposit upon any street any 
glass bottle, glass, nails, tacks, wire, cans or any other substances likely 
to injure any person, animal or vehicle upon such street.‖  If charging this 
ordinance is contemplated, ensure that the act does not constitute the 
similar, but more serious charge of reckless endangerment.  

2. AMC 9.36.100 B.  ―Any person who drops, or permits to be dropped or 
thrown upon any street any destructive or injurious material shall 
immediately remove the same or cause it to be removed.‖  This provision 
requires a person to immediately remove any harmful debris accidentally 
placed on a street.  

3. AMC 9.36.100 C.  ―Any person removing a wrecked or damaged vehicle 
from a street shall remove any glass or other injurious substance dropped 
upon the highway from such vehicle.‖  This is the ordinance that requires 
the operator of a vehicle to clean the street after an accident, or for the 
wrecker operator to clean the street when removing a vehicle he/she is 
hired to tow.  

  

4. AMC 9.46.060 A.  ―No vehicle may be driven or moved on any street 
unless such vehicle is so constructed or loaded as to prevent any of its 
load from dropping, shifting, leaking, or otherwise escaping there from, 
except that sand may be dropped for the purpose of securing traction, or 
water or other substance may be sprinkled on a roadway in cleaning or 
maintaining such roadway.‖ See AS 46.06.080 (b).  

5. AMC 9.46.060 B.  ―No person may operate on any street any vehicle 
with any load unless the load and any covering thereon are securely 
fastened so as to prevent the covering or load from becoming loose, 
detached or in any manner a hazard to other users of the street.‖  Notice 
that no littering has to occur to charge this infraction, and that it applies to 
the cover as well as the contents (i.e. just having a cover is not sufficient.  
The cover must be secure as well).  
6. AMC 875.050.   This ordinance states: ―It is unlawful for any person to:  

a). Litter in or on any property not his own on which he is not an invitee 
or licensee, or on any public building, park, recreation area, parking lot, 
street or highway; or 

b). Deface without permission...‖ [this continues as a vandalism 
ordinance]. 

7. AMC 15.20.020 B. 4.  "Disposal of refuse on another's property.  No 
person may deposit or place garbage, rubbish, ashes or other refuse upon 
a street, alley or municipally owned property, or upon any property owned 
by another or in a refuse container owned by another except with the 
consent of the owner and for the purpose of collection." [emphasis added.  
Misuse of dumpster is a zero point, mandatory court appearance 
infraction.] 

II. ILLEGAL USE OF DUMPSTERS 

A. Description.  Refuse removal service, whether commercial or Municipal is 
a purchased service.  When a person who has not paid deposits refuse in a 
private-use dumpster, an unauthorized use of that service occurs.  Further, 
the Anchorage Municipal Code regards misuse of a dumpster as depositing 
trash on another's property, and prohibits that in AMC 15.20.020 B. 4., cited in 
section "A." just above. 

B. Officer Response.  When called to such an event, officers shall regard the 
act as civil in nature, unless the violation is so great as to warrant 
investigation as a crime.  Note the following: 

1. Refuse placed outside the dumpster is littering, as described earlier in 
this procedure.  

2. A gross violation would include filling a dumpster so as to preclude use 
by the actual clients. 

III. CHARGING 

  

A. Selecting the Proper Law to Charge.  With all the various laws dealing with 
littering, the officer must choose which one(s) to charge.  Generally, it should 
be the one that best describes the event.  However, if the choice is between 
equivalent State or Municipal law, Municipal should be used unless "blending 
of charges" is being avoided (that is, if other State violations are being 
charged, do not "blend in" a Municipal code violation). 

B. Charging Document and Method.  If the violation is an infraction, it should 
be charged on a Uniform Summons and Complaint as any other infraction (for 
instance, a noncriminal traffic violation). 

C. Evidence.  The litter is to be picked up and discarded.  It is not to be kept 
as evidence.

3.02.000  Arrest & Custody Investigations 

3.02.005  Arrest-General 

To instruct and inform all personnel of the rules and procedures governing 
arrests made by members of the Anchorage Police Department. 

That arrests effected by members of the Department be legally and 
constitutionally acceptable, appropriate to the situation, using only an amount of 
force consistent with the attendant circumstances. 

A common misconception is that an arrest is the conclusion to a police operation.  
In fact, it is only a step towards the true conclusion--adjudication in court.  As a 
step, the arrest becomes a potential weak link in the chain of events leading 
towards a conviction. 

Because an arrest is such a significant intrusion into the privacy of the citizen, 
there are many protections against abuse incorporated into law.  This can make 
an otherwise simple act seem complex to officers.  This procedure explores 
arrests of all types in detail, laying a foundation for a more complete 
understanding of the actual arrest methods explained in subsequent procedures 
in this chapter. 

Probable Cause:  Reliable information in sufficient quantity and detail that would 
lead a reasonable person to believe that a crime has been committed or was 
attempted and that the suspect committed the crime. 

DEFINITIONS 

PROCEDURE 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

I. ELEMENTS OF AN ARREST 

  

A. Statutory Definition of an Arrest.  AS 12.25.160 defines arrest as ―...the 
taking of a person into custody in order that the person may be held to 
answer for the commission of a crime.‖  This statute exposes the three 
elements of an arrest, specifically: Custody of a Person to answer for a Crime 

B. Comparison of Arrests to Other Violations.  Not every type of violation of 
law can result in an arrest, and even within the body of ―arrestable offenses‖ 
are subcategories.  What creates the different categories of violations are the 
possible consequences of the act.  An understanding of the different types of 
violations enables officers to correctly select the appropriate response, 
charging document, and Police Report form.  The following list identifies the 
various categories: 

1. Criminal Offenses--These are offenses so serious that the violator can 
receive imprisonment and/or a fine in excess of $300 for committing that 
act.  The subcategories of crimes are:  

a). Felony Crimes--Which are the most serious crimes, punishable by 
imprisonment in excess of one year.  The State of Alaska has adopted 
a crime classification system that further describes the seriousness of 
the offense, which is:  

i. Unclassified Felony Offenses.  

ii. Class A Felony Offenses. 

iii. Class B Felony Offenses. 

iv. Class C Felony Offenses. 

b). Misdemeanor Crimes--Which are offenses still serious enough to 
warrant imprisonment as a possible sanction, but constitute the least 
serious criminal acts.  Misdemeanor offenses cannot be punished with 
more than one year in jail.  Alaska classifies misdemeanors as follows:  

i. Class A Misdemeanor Offenses.  

ii. Class B Misdemeanor Offenses.  

2. Infractions--Infractions are still violations of law, but fall short of being 
crimes.  Infractions are usually regulatory in nature (such as speed 
restrictions for motor vehicles, licensing requirements for hunting and 
fishing, how to properly turn a vehicle), but still regarded as important.  
How important they are can be measured by considering this:  Although a 
―conviction‖ for an infraction will not expose the violator to punishment in 
jail, failing to respond to the charge can result in at least a warrant for that 
violator‘s arrest, and/or, if the violator fails to provide officers with certain 
information required for the issuance of the charging document, the 
violator can be brought before a magistrate (through Title 12 of the Alaska 
Statutes).  Additionally, there is a separate criminal charge for providing 
false information to officers needed for the issuance of the charging 
document.  Officers should note that if a person is charged for an 
infraction (usually on a Uniform Summons and Complaint), that person 

  

must appear in court to answer to the charge unless that infraction 
appears on the ―bail forfeiture schedule‖ established by District Court Rule 
8 (and approved by the Alaska Supreme Court).  That bail schedule allows 
the violator to send in the bail amount in lieu of appearing in court.  (This 
procedure is the one officers are most familiar with--the ―traffic ticket‖--that 
has points and bail assessed.  The more serious infractions do not allow 
the violator to exercise this option, and officers recognize these offenses 
as the ―mandatory court‖ infractions.)  

3. Civil Violations--For officers, most commonly, parking and curfew 
violations.  The most important distinction between civil code and an 
infraction or crime is that the civil violator:  

a). Does not get a record of violation established; and  

b). Cannot be imprisoned, even by warrant.  Instead, ―civil action/relief‖ 
is sought through fines and impoundment of property. 

II. TYPES OF ARREST 

A. Warrant Arrests, which only police officers can serve, comprising: 

1. Felony warrants 

2. Misdemeanor warrants 

3. Traffic warrants 

4. Juvenile Detention Orders 

5. Ex-parte Orders (a court order affecting any citizen, and usually for 
mental commitments). 

B. Warrantless Arrest, comprising: 

1. Felony arrests, made by either:  

a). Personal observation of the crime; or  

b). Probable cause, established by investigation. 

Note:  The law allows a citizen to make a private person‘s felony arrest, but 
Department policy prohibits it.  Instead, officers will arrest based on probable 
cause supplied by that citizen. 

2. Misdemeanor arrests, made by  

a). officers, when either 

i. The offense occurred in their presence (see the Definition Section 
of ―Arrests--Misdemeanors‖ for full discussion), or  

ii. Through probable cause, if the misdemeanor is the result of 
domestic violence or a traffic crime.  See the specific procedure in 
this manual for details on these two sole exceptions.  

All other misdemeanor warrantless arrests require commission in the officer's 
presence (to be arrested by that officer). 

  

-OR- 

b). by a private citizen, through personal observation only.  Recall that 
Department policy allows this for misdemeanors only. 

III. EFFECTING AN ARREST 

A. Statutory Description.  AS 12.25.050 states ―An arrest is made by the 
actual restraint of a person or by a person‘s submission to the custody of the 
person making the arrest.‖ 

B. Significance.  Knowing when an arrest has been legally made is significant 
to officers for several reasons, including: 

1. Proper charging--for example, ―resisting‖ can only occur prior to the 
arrest, while ―escape‖ only after.  

2. Legal searching--prior to arrest, ―stop and frisk‖ is the only intrusion 
allowed by law, and that is solely for officer safety (so, very limited in 
scope).  After the arrest, however, the exceptions to the search warrant 
requirement include the ―search incidental to the arrest.‖  

3. ―Starting the clock‖--an arrest triggers several deadlines, including 
charging, going before the magistrate, and speedy trial. 

C. Delaying Arrest.  Officers must be aware that an immediate arrest is not 
always in the best prosecutorial interests.  Refer to ―Arrests--Felony‖ 
procedure.  

IV. ARREST AUTHORITY 

A. Background.  The Constitutions of both the United States and of the State 
of Alaska guarantee freedom from unwarranted intrusion and unlawful 
detention, while statutory law and case law define and interpret what is 
―lawful‖ detention, and who can effect that detention.  Elsewhere in this 
chapter the ―reasonableness‖ of detention is discussed in detail.  This 
procedure focuses on the police officer‘s scope of authority. 

B. Foundation of Authority.  The police officer‘s authority to arrest comes from 
two broad sources: 

1. Specific Statute--AS 12.25.010 (Persons Authorized to Arrest) ―An 
arrest may be made by a peace officer or a private person.‖  Thus, any 
competent person--not just a police officer--can make an arrest.  

2. Tradition--As expressed in case law, common law, and expectations of 
the citizenry. 

C. Expansion of Authority.  Various social and legal factors have expanded 
the police authority and responsibility, making some distinction between 
police authority and private citizen authority possible.  This includes: 

1. Service of warrants and summons. 

2. In some jurisdictions, service of certain subpoenas.  

  

3. Conducting investigative stops (i.e. field interviews, based on 
―reasonable suspicion‖).  

4. Commit mentally ill people directly for evaluation.  

5. Carry concealed weapons and certain contraband in the line of duty.  

6. Take certain persons into protective custody.  

7. Operate a motor vehicle against various traffic laws to discharge their 
duty.  

8. Obtain and serve search warrants. 

D. Police as a Recognized Profession.  The law carefully guards the citizens' 
powers of arrest, to include the application of deadly force when necessary to 
stop a crime that they coincidentally observe.  Police officers, however, are 
expected to actively and effectively seek out crime and arrest offenders.  To 
facilitate this, carefully selected, highly trained citizens are entrusted with the 
additional authority (discussed in the previous paragraph), and they are called 
―police officers.‖  The courts routinely recognize the special talents and 
equipment of police, which operate to not only expand the authority, but 
heighten the responsibility as well.  Police then, are professionals at ―citizen 
arrests,‖ and have a duty to protect the citizens who hire and trust them. 

E. On- and Off-Duty/Jurisdictional Boundaries.  The law makes no distinction 
between being ―on‖ or ―off‖ duty.  Once recognized as a police officer within 
the State, no time boundaries or political boundaries can divest officers of 
their knowledge, skills, training, or responsibilities.  A police officer does not 
―forget‖ Miranda at the end of a tour, nor are skills at detecting suspicious 
activities when outside of one's jurisdiction lost.  Realistically, though, it is 
impossible to perform all the time, in all places.  Where, then, do the 
distinctions lie between on and off duty, and in and out of jurisdiction?  Note 
the following: 

1. "On-duty‖ officers are expected to seek out criminal activity, respond to 
calls for service, and take the risks necessary to discharge these duties.  
"Off-duty‖ officers, however, revert somewhat to the role of the private 
citizen, in that they are expected to take ―appropriate‖ action to crimes 
which coincidentally occur in their presence.  

2. The ―appropriate action‖ mentioned above is greater than the action 
expected from a citizen.  The citizen is not required to take any action at 
all.  ―Appropriate action‖ for officers is that action which is both:  

a). Necessary--considering the totality of the circumstances.  A vehicle 
registration two days into expiration represents no hazard or urgency.  
A reckless driver creates some degree of danger.  The first can be 
ignored, while the second may require calling an on-duty unit, getting a 
license number and operator description, or giving first aid to a victim 
of the reckless driver. 

 -AND- 

  

b). Within present ability--meaning a consideration of the off-duty 
officer‘s weapon status, radio or home car availability, alcohol 
consumption, etc.  

F. Department Policy.  The Anchorage Police Department has adopted the 
following guidelines for police action on and off duty, and within and outside of 
the Municipal boundaries: 

1. On Duty--Primary focus is on area of assignment, actively seeking 
criminal activity and engaging in crime prevention.  Officers are to respond 
to all calls for service, and to all on-view activities.  

2. Off Duty--Take the appropriate action, as described in the above 
paragraph (E.2), for incidents detected by chance.  

3. Home Car Responses--Take appropriate action as if off-duty, but 
expanded to include response to priority calls.  Officers shall not, however, 
―jump‖ or ―chase‖ calls, nor participate in unwarranted code runs or 
pursuits.  Officers should always be aware of the limitations of a home car 
response (no portable radio, decreased effectiveness and identity out of 
uniform, etc.) and evaluate those factors when considering ―present 
ability."  Merely calling for an on-duty unit is often the most appropriate 
response.  

V. "UNARRESTING" AN INDIVIDUAL 

A. Justifiable Occasions.  Despite precautions, and even with best intentions, 
officers may discover facts suggesting the wrong person was arrested, or that 
an arrest was inappropriate.  In these cases, the following procedure applies: 

1. If the charging document has not been submitted, the subject can be 
released with an explanation.  A police report must sufficiently document 
the events leading to the arrest, and the subsequent events requiring 
reconsideration.  Additionally, officers must notify their immediate 
supervisor of the incident and the circumstances surrounding prior to the 
release. 

2. If the charging document has been submitted, officers cannot on their 
own authority "unarrest" the arrestee.  Instead, the respective prosecuting 
authority must be contacted and advised, both verbally and through 
written report (supplement), of the facts leading to the arrest and the 
subsequent reconsideration.  That prosecutor can initiate the appropriate 
action based on this new information. 

VI. Bail Hearings--Release/Incarceration 

A. Appearance Before a Magistrate. 

1. When a person is arrested for a misdemeanor, the defendant may be 
cited and released, or the officer may use the Anchorage Misdemeanor 
Bail Schedule (with restrictions), or, as with all felony arrests, must be 
brought before a magistrate for a bail hearing.  The following describes 
that hearing, and subsequent actions: 

  

a) During the defendant's appearance at the magistrate's office, 

i. Officers should provide a brief criminal history of the subject.  The 
Dispatch Center can generally provide this information to officers 
prior to arrival; and, 

ii. Officers must briefly present the facts of the case to the 
magistrate; and,  

iii. The magistrate will determine conditions of release for the 
defendant. 

Note:  Should an arrestee become violent or unruly, the magistrate can conduct a 
"curbside" bail hearing upon request. 

b). Several options are available to the magistrate:  

i. The subject can be released "on his/her own recognizance‖ 
(‖OR‘d‖), often with specific conditions of release.  In that event, 
and if the defendant agrees to sign the documents, the person is 
free to leave.  If the offense is a misdemeanor, the officer, in turn, 
has two options: 

ii. The subject can leave, and the officer can later prepare a 
Complaint as the charging document; or 

iii. The officer can complete a Uniform Summons and Complaint, 
issuing it directly to the defendant before release, using the court 
date set by the magistrate, and noting on the citation ―COURT 
DATE ASSIGNED BY MAGISTRATE.‖ 

c). Whether a felony or a misdemeanor, the subject may be required to 
post bail, either  

i. Cash only bail (the entire amount must be posted, in cash); or  

ii. Cash or bond (surety), where a bond is substituted for bail, 
guaranteeing the balance of the bail will be paid by the bonding 
company if the defendant should fail to appear in court. 

d). If a felony, the defendant may be remanded to jail custody without 
bail until arraignment. 

c). Transporting. 

i. Should the magistrate impose bail upon the defendant, the officer 
must then transport the person to the appropriate facility. 

ii. If ―OR‘d,‖ officers have no legal obligation to transport released 
subjects, but may do so at their discretion. 

VII. MEDICAL CONSIDERATIONS 

 OR  

 OR  

  

A. Detention Facility Policies.  All detention facilities have policies regarding 
the acceptance of prisoners who are in need of medical attention due to 
illness or injury.  Most often, these prisoners will not be accepted without a 
medical clearance from a physician.  Although officers generally know when 
medical treatment is needed, the requirements of each facility may differ.  
Therefore, a medical clearance will be obtained before booking whenever a 
detention facility demands such clearance. 

B. Injured by Police Action.  In all cases where an arrestee is injured as a 
result of police action, the involved officers will ensure that the subject 
receives appropriate and immediate medical attention, and will reflect in their 
reports the nature, extent and cause of that injury.  Photographs will also be 
taken of any visible injuries. 

1. In these cases, the officers' supervisors will review all the facts and 
circumstances surrounding the injury so as to:  

a). Ensure all facts are properly reported; and 

b). Review officers' actions for possible misuse of force. 

C. Injury not from Police Action.  In cases where the subject is injured, 
unconscious, or ill independent of police action, all effort should be made to 
attend to that medical aspect prior to arrest. 

D. Hospital Admittance.  Should an arrestee require actual admittance to a 
hospital, the following procedure should be followed: 

1. Ensure medical attention is provided, as expressed above.  

2. Notify a supervisor of the necessity to maintain a guard on the arrestee.  

3. Arraignment at the hospital should be arranged with a magistrate.  

4. After charging and arraignment, the Department of Corrections normally 
assumes responsibility for guarding the arrestee.  Officers, through a 
supervisor, should contact the appropriate facility to make arrangements. 

E. Refusing Medical Treatment.  Should an arrestee refuse medical 
treatment, they can be processed without further consideration.  However, 
should Department of Corrections personnel or the officer feel attention is 
required, the officer must have the attending physician provide a brief note 
verifying the subject‘s refusal. 

F. Expenses.  Officers should not obligate the Municipality to pay a medical 
bill.  However: 

1. If hospital staff indicates treatment will be denied if such authorization is 
not furnished, a field supervisor should be contacted.  

2. Officers may authorize a billing if the medical attention is related to the 
collection of evidence, as in sexual assault protocol and drawing blood for 
OUI processing. 

  

VIII. COMMUNICATIONS WITH ARRESTEES / DEFENDANTS.  Once an 
arrestee or defendant has been incarcerated or released from custody, no officer 
shall, on his or her own, re-initiate contact with that person for any reason 
(except to re-arrest) without prior permission from a supervisor. Should 
permission be granted to recontact the person, the officer shall enter that 
information into the narrative of the report. Should an officer accidentally come 
into contact with the arrestee or defendant afterward, the officer shall 
immediately notify a supervisor and that supervisor shall document the incident in 
Blue Team. 

Note: An obvious exception to this requirement would be contact at court 
proceedings.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.02.010  Arrest--Felony 

To advise all personnel of those issues unique to felony arrests. 

That felony arrests effected by members of this Department be in compliance 
with the laws and procedures which recognize the unique elements of an arrest 
for a felony offense. 

There is very little that makes a felony arrest different from any other arrest.  
However, for officer safety and successful prosecution, these differences must be 
accommodated.   

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

DEFINITIONS 

Crime:  An act or omission which can be punished by any imprisonment. 

Felony:  An act or omission which may be punished with imprisonment in excess 
of one year. 

Arrest:  The taking of custody of a person to answer to an allegation of criminal 
conduct. 

I. ELEMENTS MAKING A FELONY ARREST UNIQUE 

PROCEDURE 

A. Timing of Arrest.  Generally, it may not be necessary to make an 
immediate arrest of a non-violent felony offender.  Coordination with the 
Detective Division and the District Attorney‘s Office for case preparation 
within the legal time frame is thereby enhanced. 

B. Arrest Based on Probable Cause.  A felony arrest can be made based on 
probable cause.  Unlike a misdemeanor arrest, the offense does not have to 
be committed in the officer‘s presence.  Additionally, the probable cause can 

  

be developed by another officer. (See "Arrests--General" 3.02.005 for the 
definition of probable cause.) 

C. Prosecuting Agency.  The prosecuting agency shifts from the Municipal 
Prosecutor‘s Office for the Municipality of Anchorage to the District Attorney‘s 
Office for prosecution on the State‘s behalf.  This results in two major 
procedural changes for the officer: 

1. A charging document is not prepared by the officer.  Instead, the State‘s 
―Criminal Case Intake and Disposition" form is completed and submitted 
with the police report, and the District Attorney‘s Office determines further 
prosecution or preparation  of the case.  Only on rare occasions, and only 
with prior approval from the District Attorney, would an officer prepare a 
formal charging document, and never would an officer issue a Uniform 
Summons and Complaint for a felony crime; and  

2. A briefing with the Intake District Attorney should occur. 

II. COORDINATION WITH FIELD SUPERVISORS 

A.  Notification of Supervisor.  In cases that involve the following elements, a 
field supervisor shall be notified to assist the investigating officers with the 
coordination of the investigation: 

1. Violent felony crimes with serious physical injury 

2. Sex assault crimes where a crime scene is believed to exist 

3. Complex or unusual crime scenes 

4. Incidents that will require the assistance of detectives in the field 

5. When multiple agencies will be required for the investigation 

6. When there is injury to police personnel 

7. Where Municipality property has been damaged 

8. If police use of force has caused injury to suspects or citizens 

III. COORDINATION WITH THE DETECTIVE DIVISION 

A.  Notification of Detective Division.  Not every felony case requires the 
notification of the Detective Division.  Each event should be evaluated on a 
case by case basis with an awareness of policy directives (see above 
paragraph II A).  The officer should consider Detective Division notification 
(through their supervisor) if; 

1. An arrest or a detention of a felony suspect has occurred and the 
offense involves one or more of the following crimes; 

a). Homicide 

b). Robbery/Assault 

c). Sexual Assault/CACU 

  

d). Any other Detective specialty related to the case where its 
complexity would warrant notification 

2. When there is no arrest made:  

a). If there is a reasonable possibility that a detective will be assigned 
to follow-up, a briefing should be conducted during normal business 
hours whenever possible. 

IV. CRITERIA FOR WARRANTLESS FELONY ARREST 

A. Timing of Arrest.  Generally, it is not necessary to make an immediate 
arrest of a non-violent felony offender. 

1. Officers should make a felony arrest if delaying the arrest would:  

a). Create a physical hazard to another person; or  

b). Allow flight of the suspect; or  

c). Cause other significant problems. 

2. Coordination with the Detective Division and the District Attorney‘s 
Office for case preparation facilitates compliance with the various time 
limits.  

B. Factors to Consider in Deciding on Arrest.  A detective, supervisor, or 
patrol officer faced with the decision to make a felony arrest should consider 
the following factors: 

1. That all elements of the crime are satisfied (refer to the specific 
statute/ordinance and the Department procedure for the offense). 

2. That there is sufficient probable cause that both the crime has been 
committed, and that the suspect is the one responsible. 

3. That all evidence has been secured through proper search and seizure 
techniques. 

4. Whether there is anything to be gained or jeopardized by delaying the 
arrest.  

V. CRITERIA FOR FELONY WARRANT ARREST 

A. Immediate Arrest Expected.  Unless officer safety or another investigation 
would be compromised, it is expected that a felony warrant arrest be 
executed immediately if the subject can be located and properly identified. 

VI. OPERATIONALLY SENSITIVE/NOT FOR PUBLICATION  

VII. CHARGING AFTER ARREST 

A. The ―Criminal Case Intake and Disposition" form.  The arresting officer is 
obligated to prepare a State ―Criminal Case Intake and Disposition" form and 
submit it with the police report.  The District Attorney‘s Office requires this 
form for purposes of charging. 

  

B. Preparation of Criminal Complaint Not Required.  Unlike misdemeanors 
charged through the Municipal Prosecutor‘s Office where the officer prepares 
the charging document, the ―Criminal Case Intake and Disposition" form is 
prepared to assist the District Attorney's Office in filing the appropriate 
charging document.

3.02.015  Arrest--Fugitive from Justice 

To provide guidance for processing out of state warrants commonly known as 
Fugitive from Justice Warrants. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

It is the policy of the Anchorage Police Department to investigate the presence of 
and serve all extraditable out of state warrants in an efficient manner and to 
comply with AS12.70.120 to ensure the subjects of the warrants are not 
inadvertently released. 

I. GENERAL OPERATIONS 

PROCEDURES 

When contacting subjects with out of state warrants, officers will typically 
encounter one of three different situations:  

A. The warrant exists but the originating state will not extradite from Alaska.  
Unless there are new charges pending, the following will occur: 

1. Officers shall conduct a detailed field interview, 

2. Forward the information to US Marshals for possible future extradition, 
and  

3. Complete any reports as necessary as the result of a circumstance 
other than the Fugitive from Justice.  

B. The warrant is extraditable from Alaska and the warrant is a new charge.  
The following will occur: 

1. APD dispatch will confirm, via NLETS ―YQ‖ Message and voice contact 
with the originating agency that they will extradite from Alaska. 

2. The arresting officer must complete an Arrest Report and a Criminal 
Complaint for Fugitive from Justice. (AS 12.70.120) 

 

  

a). A File-Maker Pro file titled APD FFJ Complaintv6.20.fp5 has been 
placed under the same Host as the APD Report Writing program.  This 
form has a built-in ―Help‖ file accessed by clicking on any of the field 
names.  To use this complaint, select ―New Record‖ and enter the 
required information.  Officers may also use the File-Maker Pro 
complaint program on the MDC system.  To use this system, select 
―New State Complaint‖, and then enter a charge of fugitive from justice 
and enter the required information.  

b). No ATN is needed and the subject is not taken before the 
magistrate, unless you are adding local charges.  Address only the 
local charges with the magistrate.  Do not address the fugitive from 
justice charge. 

c). The remand sheet shall include the originating agency and the 
NCIC number.  

3. The arresting officer shall contact Alaska State Troopers and leave a 
message for Sgt Kozloff (264-0815) advising of the arrest and the APD 
case number. 

C. The warrant is extraditable from Alaska and is for a probation or parole 
violation.  The following will occur: 

1. APD dispatch will confirm via voice contact with the originating agency 
that they will extradite from Alaska and will need to additionally confirm 
that a pre signed Extradition Waiver is on file.  If no waiver is on file 
officers will then follow procedure for ―The warrant is extraditable from 
Alaska and the warrant is a new charge‖.  

2. If a pre-signed Extradition Waiver is on file, the following shall occur: 

a). The subject shall be arrested and booked at jail.  The subject is not 
taken before the magistrate.  

b). The arrest report is completed listing the offense as a 
Parole/Probation Violation, the originating agency, the NCIC number, 
and bail set at ―NO BAIL‖.  

c). No ATN or Criminal Complaint is required.  

d). Officers shall write ―pre signed Extradition Waiver on File. Do Not 
Transport to Court‖ on the portion of the remand left with corrections 
personnel.  Officers shall contact Alaska State Troopers and leave a 
message for Sgt Kozloff (264-0815) advising of the arrest and APD 
case number. 

D. For an example of the completion procedure for a Fugitive from Justice 
Arrest Report, officers are encouraged to access the ―How To‖ page of the 
APD Intranet.

3.02.020  Arrest--Juvenile 

To identify the ordinances commonly enforced by Anchorage Police Department 
members which, if violated by a juvenile, would result in that minor's arrest and 
treatment as an adult, and to instruct members on how to process such an arrest. 

PURPOSE 

DISCUSSION 

This procedure addresses only the actual arrests of juveniles for violating traffic 
laws which are criminal.  For violations of other criminal laws, the procedure 
"Custody--Juvenile Delinquency," 3.02.055, must be consulted. 

To fully appreciate the limited scope of this procedure, one is encouraged to 
review the terms defined in the following procedures:  "Custody--General" 
(3.02.045), "Arrests--General" (3.02.005), "Juveniles--General" (3.02.020), and 
"Custody--Infractions and Civil Violations" (3.02.050).  In those procedures it will 
be stressed that by definition, a juvenile cannot be arrested in the legal sense of 
the word for any criminal violation except those found in the traffic code (AMC 
Chapter 9, Alaska Statute Title 28, and 13 AAC provisions) or, less commonly, 
those in the Fish & Game  and Parks & Recreation Codes.  In those cases where 
a juvenile violates a criminal law or ordinance found outside of these codes, the 
minor is "taken into custody"  as a "delinquent minor" instead of being "arrested" 
in the full, legal context.  Such custodies are explained in the procedure 
"Custody--Juvenile Delinquency" (3.02.055). 

An officer routinely deals with juveniles who violate traffic laws, but only rarely 
encounters Fish and Game or Parks and Recreation code violations.  
Consequently, it is common to hear an abbreviated instruction of "juveniles who 
violate traffic laws are handled as adults."  Although this is technically incorrect 
(as it excludes the other two codes), it is accurate in a practical sense. 

PROCEDURE 

I. APPLICABILITY 

  

A. Applicability of this Procedure.  This procedure governs actions by 
Anchorage Police Department members when processing: 

1. Violators who have not attained their 18th birthday; and 

2. Violate the provisions of: 

a). AMC 9.10.020 A.1. and A.2. (AS 28.35.050 a) Leaving the Scene of 
an Injury Accident; and/or 

b). AMC 9.10.020 B. (AS 28.35.050 b and c) Leaving the Scene of a 
Property Damage Accident; and/or 

c). AMC 9.10.020 C.1. and C.2.(AS 28.35.060 a and b) Duty to Give 
Information; and/or 

d). AMC 9.10.080 (AS 28.35.110 and .130) False Report of an 
Accident; and/or 

e). AMC 9.12.010 B (AS 28.15.291) Driving with a Suspended, 
Revoked, or Canceled License; and/or 

f). AMC 9.12.050 A, B, C, and D (AS 28.15.281 a) various Unlawful 
Use(s) of License; and/or 

g). AMC 9.28.010 A (13AAC 02.040) Reckless Driving; and/or 

h). AMC 9.28.011 Eluding a Police Officer; and/or 

i). AMC 9.28.020 A (AS 28.35.030) Driving While Intoxicated; and/or 

j). AMC 9.28.022 (AS 28.35.032) Refusal to Submit to Chemical Tests; 
and/or 

k). AMC 9.42.020 A5 (no equivalent State charge) Operating a 
Snowmachine While Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor or 
Drugs. 

II. PROCESSING PROCEDURE 

A. Processing Similarities.  Juvenile offenders of the aforementioned laws are 
detected and arrested without special consideration for their age.  Also, 
officers must prepare a complaint (or issue a Misdemeanor Citation, as 
appropriate) just as with an adult arrest. 

B. Processing Differences.  The following constitutes the only substantial 
processing differences officers must comply with in arresting a juvenile for 
any of the aforementioned violations: 

1. Write boldly on the misdemeanor citations, or advise verbally when 
charging on a standard Court Complaint, that ―Parents must appear in 
Court with minor.‖ 

2. All juvenile bookings (of either sex), whether for traffic warrants or in 
processing any of the aforementioned violations, will take place at 
McLaughlin Youth Center. 

  

C. Common Errors. Officers are reminded of the following: 

1. Juvenile arrests for traffic violations do not require parental notification.  
However, officers may choose to make such notification, and if so, would 
not be in violation of law or policy. 

2. Many infractions appear on the "Bail Forfeiture Schedule" allowing the 
defendant to mail in the bail and forfeit that money in lieu of appearance in 
court.  Juveniles are entitled to that disposition as well.  Consequently, 
when issuing a juvenile a Uniform Summons and Complaint for an 
infraction appearing on that schedule, do not mandate "court with 
parents."  For example, if a validly licensed juvenile were to fail to stop for 
a red light, that citation would also read "4 points and $50.00 bail," just as 
an adult driver's would.  If the juvenile were to contest the ticket by choice, 
he/she would be advised by traffic court to have a parent attend court with 
him/her, and would set an appropriate appearance date.

3.02.025  Arrest--Misdemeanor 

To advise all personnel of the methods for effecting arrests of misdemeanor 
violations. 

That members of the Anchorage Police Department conduct arrests that are 
legally sufficient and acceptable, are appropriate to the situation and minimize 
risk exposure, and flow smoothly into the court and correctional system. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DEFINITIONS 

Crime:  An act or omission which can be punished by any imprisonment. 

Custody:  A restraint of liberty; a stopping of movement. 

Infraction:  An act or omission which can be punished by a fine up to $300, 
impoundment of property, or other minor sanctions, but not by imprisonment of 
any duration. 

Misdemeanor:  One type of crime which, if convicted, could subject the violator to 
a fine in excess of $300.00, and/or a term of imprisonment of up to a year, and/or 
a license action (suspension or revocation) for that single act (Note:  A traffic 
infraction does not elevate to a misdemeanor if that infraction happens to give 
the violator sufficient points for a license action.  The one act must, standing 
alone, be sufficient to allow license action). 

Arrest:  The taking of a person into custody to answer to an allegation of a 
criminal offense.  This excludes, by definition, violations or infractions.  

Charging Document:  That form which sets forth the particulars of a violation.  
These documents include: 

A. Criminal Complaint.  The document which the arresting officer, or another 
may prepare for certain misdemeanor offenses. 

  

B. Information.  A charging document prepared by a prosecutor supported by 
affidavit.  An officer will rarely have contact with this document. 

C. Uniform Summons and Complaint.  A field-issued complaint.  If the 
complaint is for a traffic infraction, it is a ―traffic citation.‖  If for an eligible 
misdemeanor, the common name is ―misdemeanor citation.‖ 

D. "Committed in One's Presence."  For purposes of this procedure, 
"presence" requires the person to detect an act (or a sufficient portion of an 
act) with any of the five senses.  That detection has to be of such quality as to 
conclude that only the person(s) accused could have committed the act(s) 
alleged. 

I. MISDEMEANOR ARRESTS 

PROCEDURE 

A. Warrant Arrests.  When the court issues an order compelling any peace 
officer to arrest and detain a specific individual for the violation of a 
misdemeanor law.  That misdemeanor law can appear in State statute, 
Municipal ordinance, the various traffic codes, or in any other body of law.  
For more information, see the procedure "Warrants/Summons/Subpoenas." 

B. Warrantless Arrests 

1. Conducted by the officer.  

a). If any misdemeanor is committed in his/her presence; or  

b). On probable cause, developed by that officer or other officers, if 
and only if the subject misdemeanor is: 

i. The DWI provisions; or 

ii. The ―Domestic Violation‖ provisions.  

2. Conducted by a private person . 

a). If any misdemeanor is committed in that citizen's presence.  

II. EXECUTING THE ARREST 

A. Warrant Arrest 

1. A warrant is a court order to arrest.  Department policy allows officers to 
select the time and place for arrest, provided they are able to articulate why 
an arrest was not immediately made.  

2. Anchorage police officers can serve any valid warrant. However, policy is 
to serve only the following:  

a). All Anchorage Police Department warrants.  

b). All Alaska State Trooper warrants, regardless of which post in the 
State originates the charge.  

c). Any other municipal warrants if that municipality agrees in advance 
to transport the subject.  This advance notice is normally in the form of 

  

announcements at briefings, flagging the computer entry, or other 
interagency means. 

3. In executing an arrest warrant, the most critical elements are:  

a). Establishing positive identity.  This includes both the identity of the 
person named on the warrant, and the identity of the subject being 
considered for arrest.  

b). Confirming the existence of the warrant through the Dispatch 
Center. 

c). "Removing" the warrant from the computer, ensuring the 
Department Serial Number (DSN) of the operator is annotated in the 
report.  

4. If both the aforementioned elements (3.a and 3.b) meet the officer‘s 
satisfaction and the officer elects to execute the warrant, the subject is 
arrested in the conventional manner (see ―In-Custody Transports‖ 
procedure).  

5. When processing a warrant arrest, ensure the following information 
appears on the Arrest Report:  

a). The warrant number; and  

b). The Arrest Tracking Number (ATN); and 

c). The original offense.  Neither ―Failure to Appear‖ nor ―Failure to 
Satisfy‖ is the violation.  The warrant should charge, for instance, 
―Failure to Appear--Shoplift‖ as the complete offense; and  

d). The bail amount or conditions of release, specifying whether that 
bail is ―Cash Only‖ or ―Third Party‖; and 

e). The agency of origin (Alaska State Trooper warrants require the 
Detachment, for instance, ―AST, Soldotna‖); and 

f). The Department Serial Number (DSN) of the computer operator who 
cleared the warrant. 

B. Warrantless Arrests 

1. Misdemeanors committed in the presence of an officer. 

a). All sworn members of the Anchorage Police Department, whether 
on or off duty, within the boundaries of the Municipality (including the 
―Hillside,‖ all Federal property, and on military reservations), may effect 
an arrest as a police officer for any misdemeanor committed in their 
presence. 

2. Misdemeanors not committed in the presence of an officer. 

a). State law allows officers to arrest for only two types of 
misdemeanor crimes if the violations did not occur in their presence. 
They are: 

  

i. Driving While Intoxicated, if the arrest can be made within four (4) 
hours of the offense; and  

ii. Domestic Violence violations, which are designed to protect a 
―spousal relationship‖ partner from having to proffer charges 
against a family member.  (See 3.01.025 Domestic Violence.) 

3. Charging a misdemeanor without physical arrest. 

a). The procedure ―Misdemeanor Citations‖ discusses using 
Misdemeanor Citations at the conclusion of misdemeanor 
investigations.  Although the misdemeanor was not committed in the 
officer‘s presence, one is reminded that issuing a Misdemeanor 
Citation is not an arrest, but rather a charging procedure.  Nothing 
prohibits officers from charging a misdemeanor offense which was not 
committed in their presence.  However, officers are also reminded that: 

i. In the absence of issuing a misdemeanor citation and releasing 
the defendant, the arrestee must be: 

(1) brought before a magistrate for a bail hearing  (See Arrests--
General, 3.02.005VI for details on bail hearings.) or; 

(2) the officer must use the current Bail Schedule for 
misdemeanor charges, 

and 

ii. Whenever a person is charged with a misdemeanor crime, 
whether a physical arrest has been made or not, officers must 
complete a Criminal Case Intake and Disposition form, and submit 
it with the Police Report. 

b). A private person cannot make a ―probable cause‖ misdemeanor 
arrest, including the DWI and Domestic Violence special provisions (for 
peace officers) described in the preceding paragraph.  Consequently, 
officers must initiate the arrest based on the probable cause furnished 
by the victim or complaining witness.  

4. Misdemeanor arrests by private persons. (See Arrest and Custody--
Private Persons 3.02.030.) 

5. State Misdemeanors.  When a person is charged with a misdemeanor 
crime, officers should cite Municipal Ordinance whenever possible.  
However, there are two exceptions to this policy: 

a). When multiple violations include both Municipal and State charges, 
then all charges should be referred to the District Attorney as State 
charges (when juveniles are arrested for misdemeanor violations, the 
officer would use State charges); and 

b). When a State misdemeanor has no Municipal law equivalent, a 
State misdemeanor must be charged.

3.02.030  Arrest--Private Person 

To advise all personnel of the procedures applicable to private persons' arrests. 

That private persons' arrests processed by officers of this Department be 
conducted in compliance with the applicable rules and statutes governing such 
arrests. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

PROCEDURE 

I. AUTHORITY 

A. AS 12.25.010 Persons Authorized to Make Arrest. ―An arrest may be made 
by a peace officer or private person.‖ 

B. AS 12.25.030 A Private Person or Peace Officer Without a Warrant May 
Arrest a Person: 

1. "For a crime committed or attempted in the presence of the person 
making the arrest; 

2. When the person has committed a felony, although not in the presence 
of the person making the arrest; 

3. When a felony has in fact been committed, and the person making the 
arrest has reasonable cause for believing the person to have committed 
it." 

Note:  It is legally permissible for a private person to make a felony arrest, but 
it is Department policy to have officers make the arrest based on the probable 
cause supplied by the complainant or upon the officer‘s investigation.  

II. OFFICERS' RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Assisting Citizen.  A private person has the same authority to arrest as 
peace officers, receiving that authority from the same statute.  But officers 

  

have training and experience in this specialized field that typical citizens do 
not.  Consequently, a private person needs the technical assistance of the 
police whenever the arrest privileges provided for in AS 12.25.010 are 
invoked.  Therefore, in calls involving a citizen‘s arrest, officers assume two 
general responsibilities: 

1. Guide citizens by answering questions, explaining the process, 
ensuring that all appropriate evidence is seized, and similar acts; and  

2. Process cases subsequent to citizens' arrests by taking custody of 
defendants, completing forms, and preparing cases for prosecution. 

B. Manner of Assistance.  Another aspect of officers' responsibilities is to 
deliver these services in a patient, helpful, and understanding fashion. 
Citizens are involving themselves in a very complex process, and look to 
officers for expert advice. 

III. ASSESSING THE CASE 

A. Case Assessment.  To satisfy the duties of assisting and processing, 
officers must review and assess the case.  At the heart of this assessment is 
the consideration of two issues, namely: 

1. The legal competency of the complainant/arrestor; and 

2. The legal sufficiency of the case, to ensure that a law has, in fact, been 
violated, and that there is adequate evidence to support a charge. 

B. Legal Competency.  Does the person know and appreciate what he/she is 
doing?  Can he/she differentiate between being a witnessing complainant and 
being an arresting complainant?  And, can that private person fully appreciate 
the significance and responsibility of arresting another person?  In assessing 
the competency, note the following: 

1. There is no specific age limit, maximum or minimum, on which to 
determine competency. 

2. Sobriety is an issue, but consumption of alcohol does not automatically 
negate one‘s authority to arrest.  

3. Being in custody does not necessarily suspend one‘s authority to arrest.  
Officers are the first examiner of competency.  If there is doubt, a 
supervisor should be consulted.  If that doubt continues, the arrest should 
not be accepted.  Instead, the police report should express the issues, 
allowing follow-up investigation with a possible charging and/or warrant 
arrest at a later date. 

C. Legal Sufficiency.  This aspect is indistinguishable from an arrest made by 
an officer, in that all elements of that crime must be proven.  Sufficient 
physical and/or testimonial evidence must be secured, requiring the officer to 
assist in, and ultimately evaluate the case.  A case with any deficiency will not 
conclude with an Officer accepting the arrest.  Instead, the field report should 

  

state the facts, facilitating follow-up with possible charging and/or warrant 
arrest at a later date. 

IV. PROCESSING THE ARREST.   

Should officers determine that a complainant is competent and the case has 
sufficient legal merit, they are obligated to assist in the arrest and processing.  As 
with any call, there can be many variables.  This section sets out the most 
common scenarios and the accepted methods of case disposition. 

A. Arrest at the Scene (Adult) 

1. Defendant in Physical Custody 

a). Officer may issue a misdemeanor citation if citation criteria are met  
(See ―Misdemeanor Citations‖); 

b). If criteria for citing are not met, or if an officer elects not to cite, then 
transport  the subject to the magistrate for a bail hearing.  At the end of 
the hearing, the defendant will either:  

i. Be released on his/her own recognizance, in which case the 
officer may either:  

(1). Issue a Misdemeanor Citation for any misdemeanor.  Use 
the date set by the magistrate, writing on the face, ―COURT 
DATE SET BY MAGISTRATE‖; or  

(2). Allow the defendant to leave, and prepare a complaint.  The 
officer should sign the complaint, and the complaint shall 
include in the probable cause statement the basis for the private 
person having made the arrest. 

2. Be remanded to the proper facility with restrictions. 

a). Suspect not in physical custody, but on scene.   

i. The citizen is not expected to overpower a suspect as a condition 
of arrest.  The officer, if satisfied with the legitimacy of the arrest, 
can apply whatever force is necessary to effect the arrest.  

ii. Once the suspect is in custody, refer to paragraph ―a.‖ of this 
section. 

B. No Arrest at Scene (Adult) 

1. Frequently an arrest is not made at the scene, as further investigation 
might be appropriate, or another investigation jeopardized, or the 
defendant may not be present. These occasions are in two broad 
categories:  

a). Further investigation is required: Officers will either conduct further 
field investigation or forward the report to the appropriate Detective 

-OR- 

-OR- 

  

Section. Officers may personally brief the follow-up detective, or submit 
the report, indicating routing to detectives for follow-up.  At the 
conclusion of the investigation, the officer who investigates may:  

i. Have an inconclusive investigation with no charge(s); or  

ii. Establish criminality and charge that person by issuing a 
misdemeanor citation or preparing and signing a complaint; or 

iii. Establish criminality and seek a warrant.  See 
―Warrants/Summons/Subpoenas" (3.02.075). 

-OR- 

2. No further investigation is required, but the defendant is not present for 
arrest.  In this event, the officer may prepare a complaint and seek a 
summons or warrant, as described in ―Warrants/Summons/Subpoenas‖ 
(3.02.075). 

V. MISCELLANEOUS PROCESSING ISSUES--ADULTS 

A. Private Persons' Arrest Form.  In all cases, the private person will provide 
the officer with a signed statement, normally by way of a completed ―Private 
Persons' Arrest" form.  This will become a part of the original Police Report. 

B. Multiple Counts.  If officers observe criminal action and make an arrest 
coincidentally with the citizen‘s arrest, both (all) counts can be on one 
Complaint.  If the private person makes arrests for multiple offenses, all 
counts can appear on one complaint also. 

C. Use of Judge or Notary.  Any complaint can be signed in front of a judge or 
magistrate, but complaints not involving a warrant or summons may be 
signed before a notary instead.  It is policy to sign in front of a notary when 
able. 

D. Never instruct a private person to contact the Municipal Prosecutor‘s Office 
to bring charges.  The officer is responsible for preparation of a charging 
document and completion of a field report, as instructed above. 

VI. JUVENILES ―ARRESTED‖ BY PRIVATE PERSONS 

A. Nothing precludes juveniles from being ―arrested‖ by a citizen.  In 
assessing the case, however, the officer should be alert to the intent aspect 
essential to the commission of any crime.  A child has to be old enough to 
form malicious, criminal intent to be held responsible for committing an act of 
delinquency. 

B. Processing of any juvenile arrest can be found in the ―Arrests--Juveniles‖ 
and the ―Custody--Juvenile Delinquency‖ sections of this chapter.  Note that 
there are no substantial differences between a call for an adult arrested by a 
citizen and a juvenile arrested by a citizen.  Even the signed statement 
(usually in the form of the ―Private Persons' Arrest" form) from the arresting 
citizen remains a requirement.  The disposition of the case is where the 
differences surface. 

  

C. As both the "Arrest" and "Juvenile" Procedures state, a juvenile is not 
issued a misdemeanor citation for anything other than criminal violations of 
the Traffic Codes (AS 28, 13AAC, or AMC 9). 

VII. FIELD REPORT FEATURES 

A. Special Report Emphasis.  The Report Writing Manual should be consulted 
for details on when and how to complete the various field reports.  However, 
note the following two special considerations when documenting a Private 
Person's Arrest:  

1. Accurate telephone numbers and addresses are particularly important.  

2. A legible, comprehensive ―Private Persons' Arrest" form can substitute 
for a lengthy ―Interview with Complainant‖ section.

3.02.035  Clandestine Laboratory Enforcement 

To establish a procedure that will afford the best degree of safety to both law 
enforcement officers and other persons involved in the discovery, investigation 
and dismantling of a clandestine drug laboratory. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

The policy of the Anchorage Police Department is to ensure public safety, 
minimize employee exposure incidents, reduce the spread of chemical 
contamination, assure maximum prosecution of perpetrators, and compliance 
with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations relating 
to the investigation, seizure and dismantling of clandestine drug laboratories. 

DISCUSSION 

Clandestine drug laboratories pose a significant risk of injury and death to the 
public as well as officers not prepared and/or equipped to enter such 
environments.  These risks include fire and explosion, inhalation hazards, 
chemical burns, long term health effects, and the spread of contamination to 
department and personally owned property. 

Clandestine drug laboratories are regulated by OSHA once discovered by law 
enforcement personnel.  The Anchorage Police Department will insure that 
OSHA requirements are understood and complied with by those members of the 
department who intentionally or knowingly enter clandestine drug laboratory 
environments. 

DEFINITIONS 

Clandestine Laboratory:  An illegal operation consisting of a sufficient 
combination of apparatus and chemicals that either is being, has been, or could 
be used in the manufacture or synthesis of controlled substances, precursors, or 
necessary chemicals for the manufacture of controlled substances. 

  

Clandestine Laboratory Specialist:  A member of the department who has 
attended an OSHA approved 40-hour clandestine laboratory safety certification 
class, 24-hours of documented on the job training with the Drug Enforcement 
Unit clandestine lab team, and is currently clandestine laboratory certified by 
attending an 8-hour refresher course within the past 12 months.  Members must 
also comply with the required ongoing medical monitoring.  

Contamination:  Occurs anytime a person inhales airborne substances, is 
injected, skin penetration occurs, or a person ingests by mouth from eating, 
smoking or chewing prior to being completely decontaminated.  Contamination is 
also skin contact where a splash or any contact with a substance to exposed skin 
occurs or where the substance passes through protective clothes or gloves.  
Contamination may occur to either persons or property. 

Exigent Situation:  For the purpose of this policy is defined as but not limited to 
the following: any situation that could result in death, serious injury, 
contamination to the environment, or a lab that if left unattended could result in 
explosion.

3.02.040  Custody--Field Interviews 

To provide all sworn personnel with guidelines on how to most effectively 
recognize suspicious situations, confront the object(s) of those suspicions, and 
record the information obtained in the filed interview. 

It is the policy of the Anchorage Police Department to effectively investigate and 
collect information on suspicious activities while maintaining officer safety and 
reducing undue embarrassment or delays to the innocent citizen. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

During the course of police duties, officers are routinely alerted to a variety of 
suspicious circumstances.  Although they may not be witnessing a recognizable 
crime, there is still the authority, indeed the obligation, to investigate those 
circumstances.  If an officer‘s suspicions are not allayed, it is appropriate to 
document the identification of the participants and the attendant circumstances.  
This is done in the ―Interview Module‖ in Packet Writer.  What follows are 
guidelines on how to recognize suspicious activities, and how to approach the 
subjects, collect information, and record that information in a fashion most usable 
by the Department.  

I. OBJECTIVES 

PROCEDURE 

A. Purpose of the Interview Module (formally field interview cards).  The 
Interview Module can serve the following purposes: 

1. Link persons with crime. 

2. Establish background information on certain people. 

3. Gain information on locates. 

4. Link criminals with their companions and vehicles. 

  

5. Recover evidence and stolen goods. 

6. Deter crime by police presence. 

7. Provide data on recidivists and dangerous people.  

8. Provide a data base for modus operandi. 

II. WHAT CONSTITUES ―SUSPICIOUS CIRUMSTANCES‖? 

A. Elements of Suspicion.  Recognizing ―something suspicious‖ while others 
pay no attention is a talent most officers‘ prize.  If one analyzes what actually 
arouses suspicions, four ingredients are discovered, namely: 

1. Time. 

2. Location. 

3. Appearance. 

4. Activity. 

B. Reasonableness of Suspicion.  If just one of these elements is ―out of 
place,‖ a sense of curiosity—a feeling of suspicion—can be experienced.  Of 
the four ingredients, legal standards are especially interested in the persons‘ 
activities.  Truly suspicious activities not only give the officer the authority to 
investigate further, but impose the duty to do so.  Courts consistently uphold 
the validity of stops wherein officers can explain how any reasonable and 
similarly trained officer would have been suspicious given the same set of 
circumstances (Terry v. Ohio 392 U.S. 1).  What courts do not uphold are 
stops based on other grounds, such as: 

1. Revenge. 

2. Idle curiosity. 

3. Racial/ethnic disdain. 

4. Securing information for personal use (telephone number, etc).  

III. APPROACHING THE SUBJECT 

A. Be Courteous.  Two valuable goals are achieved when subjects are politely 
informed of why they are being questioned: 

1. If the inquiry reveals no cause for alarm, good public relations are 
promoted. 

2. If the investigation has disrupted any improper behavior, experience 
has repeatedly shown that, if officers can minimize the sense of alarm, 
persons will often try to explain their activities/appearance instead of 
becoming argumentative or defensive.  Officers, therefore, stand to 
promote the investigation by using this approach.  

B. Avoid Filling Out Forms at Scene.  Transferring mental notes onto the Field 
Interview card after the interview seems to lessen the negative impact of an 

  

officer ―filling out an official police report even though we didn‘t do anything 
wrong.‖ 

IV. AUTHORITY TO ―STOP‖ VERSUS ―ARREST‖ 

A. Introduction.  In the procedure ―Custody—General,‖ the concept of custody 
is explained as any restraint of liberty.  Commonly, we regard custody as an 
arrest, and become familiar with the statutes granting both private citizens 
and peace officers the power of arrest.  But arrest is only one form of custody, 
and when police officers take people into other forms of custody, the 
confidence in their authority tends to wane.  This procedure deals with 
authority and limitations for custodial activities other than an arrest, and is 
designed to give officers a formal grasp of this aspect of their responsibilities.  

V. RANGES OF CUSTODY 

A. Amount of Restraint.  ―Restraint of Liberty‖ can range from a full arrest, 
including the application of deadly force, down to the temporary ―detention‖ 
needed for the issuance of a traffic ticket.  This degree of restraint generates 
profound legal issues, because it calls for the balancing of two demands 
made by our citizens:  First, for the government to protect citizens from 
criminality, and second, to protect the citizens from unnecessary intrusion into 
their private lives.  The Constitution was explicit in providing the second 
safeguard, but it was up to later case law and statute to decide how that 
protection was to be delivered in a ―Constitutionally acceptable‖ fashion. 

VI. ―REASONABLENESS‖ OF RESTRAINT 

A. Balancing Police Powers.  Balancing the need for protection from crime 
with protection from unwarranted intrusion came under much scrutiny.  
Eventually, a consensus began to surface.  In order for the police to balance 
their duty to protect with their obligation not to abuse their power to intrude, a 
concept emerged—that of reasonableness.  That single concept—
reasonableness—is at the heart of the police powers allowing custody to be 
assumed.   

VII. AUTHORITY TO DETAIN IS BASED ON REASONABLENESS OF 
RESTRAINT 

A. Purpose of the Detention.  If officers are alerted to circumstances that 
would arouse suspicion with any reasonably trained officer, they are duty-
bound to investigate, and vested with the authority to require the involved 
subject(s) to submit to a reasonable investigation to either: 

1. Allay the suspicions; or 

2. Establish criminality; or 

3. Secure enough information to recontact the parties should a later 
investigation require it.  

B. Elements of ―Reasonableness.‖  Such an investigation requires a restraint 
of liberty, so is, in fact, a form of custody.  Officers gain authority to take this 

  

custody based on ―reasonableness‖.  The ‗reasonableness,‖ in turn, is 
gauged by two considerations: 

1. The reasonableness of the suspicion.  That is, would any similarly trained 
officer have become suspicious given the circumstances confronting the 
officer? 

2. The reasonableness of the ―depth of the probe.‖  That is, to investigate the 
suspicious circumstances, officers must be reasonable in:  

a).The length of time spent in the probe. 

b). The degree and topics of questioning used in the inquiry. 

c).The depth and appropriateness of any searches. 

d). Other considerations. 

C. Force and pat-Down Allowed.  (See Section ―IX.‖ later in this procedure).  If 
officers operate in good faith and have made a reasonable stop, they are 
allowed to use legal amounts of force to gain and retain custody of the 
subject(s). 

1. As with any police action, the ―proper‖ amount of force is a reasonable 
amount of force required to discharge a legal duty.  See the procedure on 
―Response to Resistance‖ for full discussion. 

2. Even though the custody for a field interview is not an arrest, the law 
allows a ―stop and frisk‖ pat down for weapons if circumstances would 
lead a ―reasonable person‖ to believe weapons might be involved.   

Note: This is not a true search for criminal evidence, but a weapons pat-
down for officer safety only.  Should a weapon-like object be seized which 
later proves to be evidence of a crime, however, that evidence may be 
valid if discovered accidentally (Caution: Courts view this type of evidence 
seizure with suspicion.  Officers must convincingly articulate that the 
discovery of the evidence was, indeed, purely accidental based on the 
belief that the object was a weapon.) 

D. Subjects Not Required to Cooperate.  Authority and duty to stop and 
question does not imply a person has a legal duty to cooperate.  In fact, it is 
not a crime to refuse to furnish any identification.  This one area exposes 
officers to the greatest civil and disciplinary risk, and calls for the highest 
degree of professionalism to resolve.  To aid officers, the following comments 
are provided: 

1. Failing to identify, trying to leave, refusing to disclose one‘s residence 
address, and similar acts can operate to enhance officer‘s suspicions, 
allowing a deeper probe.  Being uncooperative does not always elevate 
officer‘s suspicions, but it may do so.  The totality of the situation must be 
considered, and officers are warned that any field interview initiated or 
continued out of revenge or idle curiosity is illegal. 

  

2. A good investigation can often reveal the information sought without the 
subject‘s participation.  An interview with associates or a surveillance of 
reasonable limits is two possible alternatives. 

3. Photographs may be taken of the subject. 

4. A supervisor may be called to the scene to assist.  In addition to 
providing supervision, such assistance can include a new personality that 
might inspire more cooperation, the possibility of recognizing the 
subject(s) involved, and/or a witness to the officer‘s activities to deter 
allegations of misconduct,  

E. Summary of this Section.  Officers who can articulate the reasonableness 
of the suspicion(s) and the appropriateness of the depth of their probe are 
generally within their authority.  Resistance to reasonable inquiry can operate 
to reinforce officers‘ suspicions, and crime(s) committed and force used as a 
result of that escalating resistance stand on their own merit.  As an example, 
if a person assaults an officer to avoid a reasonable detention, that subject 
can be arrested for that assault even if a plausible, noncriminal explanation 
for the original suspicion is later established.  

VIII. POLICE RESPONSIBILITY 

A. Criteria for Stop and Interview.  To exercise the authority to take the 
custody described, certain standards must be met, and the burden of proof 
remains with the government.  These standards include: 

1. Any stop must stand the test of reasonableness.  This test is to ensure 
that such unacceptable motivations as harassment, revenge, and sexual 
impropriety do not enter into police/governmental activities.  Note that 
other protections afforded the citizens can include criminal and civil relief.   

2. The citizen must clearly recognize the person stopping him/her as being 
a police officer.  This holds true for conducting field interviews as well.   

3. Officers must clearly express the demand for temporary detention. 

IX. USE OF FORCE DURING FIELD INTERVIEWS 

A. Issues on Use of Force.  An important aspect of police authority in such a 
stop is the amount of force officers can use to enforce this ―temporary 
detention.‖  Each situation is judged on its merits (of reasonableness), but 
some clues exist to aid officers in answering this question.   

1. If the stop is unreasonable, no amount of force can be applied to 
enforce the detention. 

2. If officers are not obviously a police officer, the subject is not obligated 
to stop. 

3. On a reasonable inquiry by a fully identified officer, flight or resistance 
adds to the degree of suspicion, but might not elevate the issue to a crime 
(mere flight or failing to identify oneself is not a crime).  If a law is violated 
during this resistance (traffic infractions, assault, trespass), then officers 

  

are fully empowered to base all subsequent acts on offense(s) committed 
in their presence.  

B. Procedure Not All-inclusive.  No procedure can cover all scenarios, so 
questionable areas remain, and the courts exist to adjudicate those issues.  
Most people experienced in these matters agree—if officers operate in good 
faith, the ―reasonable person‖ test will usually be met.  

C. Review of Steps.  Officers, therefore, must: 

1. Recognize the event as suspicious or illegal; and 

2. Be able to tell why any reasonable person would have drawn the same 
or functionally similar conclusions/suspicions; and 

3. Make reasonable limits to the depth of the probe (time, force, 
expectations of the subject, etc.).

3.02.045  Custody--General 

To instruct and inform all employees of the laws and definitions associated with 
taking custody of citizens by sworn personnel. 

PURPOSE 

DEFINITIONS 

Custody:  A restraint of liberty.  This term varies its meaning depending on its 
uses within juvenile law, corrections, and other areas.  In this procedure, it is the 
broadest term used to describe a stopping of movement, a submission to an 
officer.  Custody alone is not necessarily an arrest, even though force may be 
used to gain or maintain custody. 

Arrest:  ―...the taking of a person into custody in order that the person may be 
held to answer for the commission of a crime‖ (AS 12.25.160).  Notice there are 
three elements to this definition: 

1. Custody (the restraint of liberty); 

2. of a Person; 

3. to answer to a Criminal Offense. 

Arrest is merely one form of custody, the purpose of which is to answer to a 
criminal allegation.  Recall that there are many violations with which a person 
may be charged which are not criminal allegations.  See the following definitions 
for clarification.   

Crime:  The commission or omission of an act which can be punished by 
imprisonment or a fine exceeding $300.00.  In this jurisdiction, it also includes 
violations which could result in license action.  There are two basic categories of 
crimes, namely: 

1. Misdemeanors, or Minor Crimes.  Conviction of a misdemeanor offense 
punishable by a fine over $300.00, and/or by imprisonment up to one year, 
and/or by license suspension or revocation. 

  

2. Felonies, or Major Crimes.  Conviction of a felony can result in a large fine, 
and/or imprisonment exceeding one year. 

Infractions:  The commission or omission of an act which is in violation of law, but 
not punishable by any imprisonment or by any fine exceeding $300.00.  Instead 
sanctions include small fines and impoundment of property. 

Note that most ―traffic violations‖ are infractions, but some are criminal.  A law 
appearing in the traffic code is not automatically an infraction.  What determines 
if an act is an infraction, misdemeanor, or felony is the possible consequences 
for the violation.  Examples of traffic violations which are criminal include DWI, 
DWLS/DWLR, and Reckless Driving. 

Charging Document:  That document which identifies a violator and specifies the 
time, date, and location of a crime or infraction, as well as identifying the violation 
itself.  The most common charging documents include: 

Court Complaint  

Information, a complaint, supported by affidavit, initiated by a prosecutor.  

Uniform Summons and Complaint, used for both  

Traffic violations (and certain other infractions); and 

Misdemeanor citation  

Parking Citation, to allege a violation of a parking law.  

Taxicab Violation Citation, to allege a violation of a taxicab ordinance. 

Civil Citation, used for Municipal Code violations, including Curfew, and 
allowing appearance before an Administrative Hearing Officer. 

PROCEDURE 

I. CATEGORIES OF CUSTODY 

A. Protective Custodies, including: 

1. Juvenile runaway, curfew, and abuse/neglect provisions. 

2. Non-Criminal Commitment, for both adults and juveniles. 

3. Mentally ill provisions. 

B. Infractions 

C. Arrests, both misdemeanor and felony. 

D. Miscellaneous, especially investigative stops and juvenile detentions. 

II. MISCELLANEOUS 

A. Use of Force is Authorized.  Officers may use whatever reasonable force is 
necessary to effect any lawful custody, and/or seizure--even if that custody is 
not an arrest.  See "Response to Resistance" procedure, 3.05.025.

3.02.050  Custody--Infractions/Civil Violations 

To instruct all personnel of the procedures governing the processing of 
infractions and civil violations. 

PURPOSE 

DEFINITIONS 

Infraction:  A violation of a law that can subject the violator to a fine less than 
$300.00 and/or impoundment of property, or other such minor sanctions.  An 
infraction is distinguished from a crime in that a violation of an infraction cannot 
subject the violator to any term of imprisonment or community service or to any 
large fine. 

Charging Document:  That document which specifies the particulars of the 
violation (the who, what, where and when of the violation).  These documents 
include: 

Court Complaint:  A form that specifies the particulars of a criminal violation, 
usually submitted by an officer or other complainant. 

Information:  A complaint submitted by a prosecutor, supported by affidavit. 
The officer will have little exposure to this form of charging. 

Uniform Summons and Complaint:  A form used for both: 

Charging most infractions (such as traffic); and 

Charging some misdemeanor offenses.  When used for this application, 
the form is commonly called a "misdemeanor citation." 

Civil Citation:  A form that may be used to charge infractions set forth in the 
fine schedule contained in Anchorage Municipal Code, Title 14.  Hearings on 
such charges are  conducted by the municipality's Administrative Hearings 
Officer instead of in District Court. 

Taxicab Violation Citation:  A form used to charge a violation of any of the 
laws governing taxicab operation.  If a taxicab operator violates a general 

  

traffic law, however, the Uniform Summons and Complaint (i.e. "Traffic 
Citation") is used. 

Parking Citation:  A form used to charge parking violations. 

I. BACKGROUND 

PROCEDURE 

A. Types of Violations.  Modern society is governed by volumes of laws.  Of 
all these laws, however, only a fraction are deemed so serious as to require 
arrest if violated.  Most are more regulatory in nature so, if violated, subject 
the violator to a lesser punishment than jail time.  It is the possible 
consequences of violating a certain law that determines its category.  As 
described in the general arrest procedure, these categories of offenses are: 

B. Criminal offenses.  A crime is a violation so serious that to be convicted of 
such an act could result in a term of imprisonment, and/or imposition of a term 
of community service, and/or a fine exceeding $300.00.  Since the word 
"arrest" is defined as the taking into custody of a person to answer to an 
allegation of a criminal act, it becomes obvious that a person can only be 
arrested for violating a law falling in the category of "criminal."  Consequently, 
if a person is stopped for an infraction such as running a red light, that person 
is taken into temporary custody (to allow issuing of the citation), but is not 
arrested for the noncriminal act of running a red light.  Of the possible criminal 
acts, there are subcategories: 

1. Felony crimes--which are the most serious crimes, punishable by 
imprisonment in excess of one year; and 

2. Misdemeanor crimes--which are the least serious criminal offenses, but 
still serious enough to deserve jail time (up to a year) if committed. 

B. Infractions.  Infractions, like crimes, are violations of law, but differ from 
crimes in that the possible consequences do not include either imprisonment 
or community service as punishment.  Being less than a crime, however, 
does not imply infractions are not taken seriously.  Consider the following: 

1. If a violator refuses to give the necessary information to the officer to 
complete an accurate charging document (normally the Uniform Summons 
and Complaint or the Civil Citation, issued in the field), that person can be 
brought before a magistrate, who can hold that person in jail until the 
information is provided (AK ST 12.25.180.(b)). 

2. If a violator purposely provides false information to the officer for the 
completion of the charging document, that person can be arrested for a 
criminal offense. 

3. Infractions are presumed to require court appearance.  District Court 
Rule 8, however, recognized a large body of infractions that seemed 
appropriate for non-judicial review, and so authorized the "bail forfeiture 
schedule."  Officers who have issued a conventional "traffic ticket" that 
specifies the points and bail assessed have used this bail forfeiture 

  

provision.  This gives the violator the option of mailing the bail, checking 
the no-contest plea box, and dispensing with a physical appearance in 
court.  Many infractions however, are not assigned a bail on this schedule, 
and are the "mandatory appearance" citations (within 5 working days), 
which officers should readily recall. 

C. Civil violations.  For the officer, the most commonly thought of civil violation 
is the parking violation.  However, Anchorage Municipal Code Section 
14.20.020(B) grants to the municipality's Administrative Hearings Officer 
jurisdiction "concurrent with that of the Alaska State Courts" over civil 
violations set forth in the fine schedule contained in AMC 14.60.030.  The 
Administrative Hearings Officer may assess civil penalties (fines) and costs 
but may not assess attorney's fees, impose community service, provide 
injunctive relief, or suspend licenses.  Civil violations are distinct in that: 

1. No criminal record is established on the offender. 

2. No imprisonment, even by warrant, is possible.  Instead, "civil relief" is 
sought through fines, impoundments, and civil collections proceedings. 

II. APPLICABILITY OF INFRACTIONS TO JUVENILES 

A. Juveniles Charged as Adults.  Because of the regulatory (versus criminal) 
nature of most infractions, juveniles may be charged in state court as adults 
for all infractions found in the traffic code, those having to do with tobacco or 
alcohol violations, Fish and Wildlife regulations, and Parks and Recreation 
rules. 

The Municipality has several infractions that fall in the criminal code (AMC 8 
series), but they are outside of the categories listed above.  Charging 
juveniles with one or more of these infractions must be done through the 
Administrative Hearings process via use of a Civil Citation. 

B. Avoid Confusion with Criminal Violations.  Just like several infractions 
appear in the criminal code, some criminal violations appear randomly in 
codes that are almost exclusively infractions.  For instance, the "hit and run" 
ordinances and the "DWI" provisions are criminal, but appear in the digest of 
traffic infractions known as Anchorage Municipal Code Title 9.  Therefore: 

1. If a juvenile violates such a criminal law within that code (i.e. a traffic 
crime), he/she is arrested as detailed in the procedure "Arrests--
Juveniles". 

2. If the juvenile violates infractions contained in the fine schedule listed in 
municipal code 14.60.030, he/she must be cited into the Administrative 
Hearings process by use of a Civil Citation form. 

3. If the juvenile violates any other criminal code, including most of AMC 
Title 8 (i.e. non-traffic criminal), that minor is handled as a delinquent, as 
discussed in the procedure entitled "Custody--Juvenile Delinquency". 

III. CHARGING DOCUMENT 

  

A. Proper Completion of Form.  No field report is required when charging an 
infraction, if evidence was not seized, as the citation serves as the report.  
Instead, field notes and/or notes on the back of the citation are adequate. 

B. Proper Use of Forms.  The following forms are to be used when charging 
the respective violations: 

1. Parking citation.  Used to charge any violation of a Municipal parking 
ordinance (AMC 9.30 series, 9.32 series, and 9.34 series in their entirety).  
This document is used on commercial and private vehicles with no 
distinction. 

2. Taxicab violation citation.  Used to charge any taxicab operator with 
violation(s) of any of the specific taxicab ordinances (the entire AMC 
11.10, 11.20, and 11.30 series).  Note that these laws apply to taxicabs 
only, and have their specific charging form. 

3. Civil citation.  Used to charge infractions set forth in the fine schedule 
contained in AMC 14.60.030.  All violations charged through use of this 
form will be heard by the municipality's Administrative Hearings Officer 
instead of in state court. 

4. Uniform summons and complaint.  Used to charge the following 
infractions: 

a). Violations of any of the noncriminal traffic ordinances committed by 
either an adult or a juvenile.  These include both Municipal and State 
traffic infractions, as found in AMC 9 series, the State 13AAC series, 
and State Title 28 provisions.  Recall that the criminal traffic offenses 
can also be charged on the Uniform Summons and Complaint, but 
when they are that form is no longer a "traffic ticket" charging a traffic 
infraction, but a "misdemeanor citation" charging a criminal act, and is 
processed differently. 

b). Violations of various infractions, such as Parks and Recreation 
ordinances or Fish and Wildlife laws.  Anchorage Police Officers have 
very limited contact with these offenses, but can make charges of such 
infractions on the Uniform Summons and Complaint. 

c). Violations of various infractions committed by juveniles that fall 
within the categories of Alcohol related ordinances or statutes, Parks 
and Recreation ordinances, or Fish and Wildlife laws. 

IV. TRAFFIC 

A. Traffic Represents Most Infractions.  For the Anchorage Police Department 
member, traffic represents the vast majority of infractions charged.  To 
provide more specific procedural information to the officer, this section is 
included.  It would be wise to remember, however, that infractions appear in 
many other codes besides traffic (Parks and Recreation, Fish and Wildlife, 
health codes). 

  

B. Bail Forfeiture Schedule.  All infractions were originally presumed to 
require court appearance.  However, practice soon showed that not each 
case could be adequately heard, and the majority of offenses were not 
contested.  It became apparent that not each offender had to appear in court, 
so the court system developed a list of infractions that could be handled by 
mail.  District Court Rule 8 authorized the "Bail Forfeiture Schedule," which 
was the list of eligible infractions, their bail amount, and the associated points 
assessment developed administratively by the Division of Motor Vehicles (not 
the court system).  This allowed: 

1. Officers to issue a charging document (the Uniformed Summons and 
Complaint for the infraction, and put the pre-decided bail amount on the 
ticket without having to appear before a magistrate for a bail hearing). 

2. The defendant to exercise the option of never appearing in court, but 
forfeit the bail and have the points assessed against his or her license in 
an assumed guilty/no contest plea. 

3. The defendant to retain the right to contest the citation by posting that 
bail amount (assigned in the field), and establishing a court date for 
testimony.   

C. Infractions that Do Not Appear on the Bail Forfeiture Schedule.  All 
infractions that do not appear on the Bail Forfeiture Schedule require court 
appearance.  In issuing the Uniform Summons and Complaint, officers 
annotate "MANDATORY COURT--WITHIN 5 WORKING DAYS," allowing the 
defendant to appear in court anytime during normal working hours. 

D. Correctable Infractions.  Some equipment violations give the defendant 
one additional method of resolution--to correct the deficiency, have it 
inspected for verification and adequacy, and thereby void the citation and 
possible penalties.  These are known as "correctable" violations.  When 
issuing a citation alleging a correctable violation, officers shall mark the box 
indicating: 

1. Correctable: This citation will be dismissed if you correct the defect and 
present the vehicle for inspection within 7 days at:  

a). Anchorage Police Department, 4501 Elmore  

b). Environmental Service Division, 825 L. St. (for excessive exhaust 
noise violations (AMC 9.44.330 B-E). 

V. OTHER CIVIL INFRACTIONS--THE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS 
PROCESS 

A. Civil infractions are contained in several chapters of the Anchorage 
Municipal Code.  For the purpose of enforcement, those infractions have 
been listed in the fine schedule contained in AMC 14.60.030.  Enforcement of 
any of these ordinances may be done by any code enforcement officer of the 
municipality including, but not limited to, Anchorage Police Officers, 

  

Anchorage Fire Department Officers, Building Safety Officers, Zoning 
Enforcement Officers, or Health Inspection Officers. 

For the Anchorage Police Department member, civil violations represent a 
distinct minority of infractions charged.  However, to provide more specific 
procedural information to officers, this section is included. 

B. Civil Fine Schedule (AMC 14.60.030).  Anchorage Municipal Code 
14.20.020 authorizes the Administrative Hearings Officer to have jurisdiction 
over infractions for which a civil penalty is set forth in the fine schedule in 
AMC 14.60.030.  This jurisdiction is to be "concurrent with that of state court."  
In plain language, this means that, if the violation appears in the Title 14 fine 
schedule, an Anchorage Police Officer may elect to charge a violator through 
either the Administrative Hearings process (Civil Citation) or the state court 
(Uniformed Summons and Complaint), whichever is appropriate.  The notable 
exceptions here are violations committed by juveniles which are explored in 
detail in section B. of this chapter. 

In uncontested cases and those in which, through the hearings process, the 
Administrative Hearings Officer decides that the person committed the 
offense, the only "sentence" possible is the imposition of the requested fine.  
Use of other actions by the Administrative Hearings Officer, such as 
suspensions of fines, terms of jail, probation or community service, or the 
awarding of attorney's fees, is not allowed.   

C. Benefits of Using the Administrative Hearings Process.  Some of the same 
benefits accrue to officers and defendants using the Administrative Hearings 
process as in the use of the bail schedule for traffic violations.  Some 
significant differences do exist, primarily: 

1. Officers must issue a different charging document (the Civil Citation) for 
the infraction, and write the pre-decided bail amount as listed in the Title 
14 fine schedule on the ticket. 

2. The defendant may exercise the option of sending in the fine amount 
indicated or requesting an administrative hearing.  In either case, no 
points can be assessed against any license held by the defendant. 

3. The defendant retains the right to contest the citation by posting that 
fine amount (assigned in the field) and establishing a date for an 
administrative hearing.  If the defendant ignores the citation completely or 
fails to appear for a scheduled administrative hearing without posting the 
fine, a default judgment will be entered against him/her and collection 
proceedings could be initiated.  If the defendant posts the fine amount and 
requests an administrative hearing but fails to appear, the Administrative 
Hearings Officer would enter a default judgment against him/her and close 
the case. 

D. Writing a Civil Citation for an Infraction Appearing on the Title 14 Fine 
Schedule.  Since the rights of defendants and the requirements for 
processing differ from those in criminal or traffic cases, the standard Uniform 

  

Summons and Complaint form cannot be used to charge violators.  The 
proper charging document is the Civil Citation.  

1. Though the Civil Citation appears substantially similar to the Uniform 
Summons and Complaint, there are differences in both structure and 
processing. 

a). Only civil violations listed in the civil fine schedule set forth in Title 
14 of the Municipal Code may be charged on a Civil Citation form.   

b). The ―Description of Violation‖ block must contain a brief charging 
statement noting sufficient information to establish a prima facie case, 
or the citation may be dismissed.  The reverse of the pink copy may be 
used to add additional officer notes.   

c). The officer must enter the amount of the fine in the space provided.  
Some violations show a range of possible fines but, for our purposes, 
the standard amount assessed will be the lower figure unless there are 
aggravating circumstances justifying an increased fine.  If so, these 
circumstances must be articulated on the reverse of the officer's (pink) 
copy, or in a police report. 

d). The violator is not required to sign the citation and the officer 
certifies service by checking the appropriate block.   

e). The violator receives the last two (white) copies of citation, the 
Statement of Rights sheet, and a pre-addressed envelope.  The 
reverse of the violator's copies contain instructions for the defendant 
on how the citation may be handled. 

2. Issuance of a civil citation does not require a police report unless the 
circumstances are such that the situation cannot be fully explained on the 
ticket form, or if the citation is part of a larger investigation involving the 
possibility of criminal charges.  In those cases, the case number must be 
entered in the marked spaces along the right margin.  

3. Violations of civil infractions do not require court appearances by either 
adults or minors.  However, if a hearing is requested by the defendant, 
such hearing will be held before the Municipal Administrative Hearings 
Officer.    

If a juvenile requests an administrative hearing, a parent or guardian must 
appear at any hearing so requested by the juvenile.    

VI. SUMMARY 

Infractions are minor offenses that, like crimes, are still violations of law, but do 
not carry with them the possibility of jail time.  Most are charged on specific forms 
which are rather self -explanatory.  Juvenile offenders are charged just as an 
adult would be for all but the AMC Title 8 infractions previously noted that must 
be handled through the administrative hearings process.  For those infractions 
which require court appearance, the officer must write on the charging document 
that the parent must appear in court with the juvenile.

3.02.055  Custody--Juvenile Delinquency 

To advise all personnel of the procedure for taking minors into custody for the 
commission of delinquent acts.  

PURPOSE 

DISCUSSION 

The Concept of Juvenile Delinquency 

Minors are processed through the Juvenile Justice System as per Alaska Statue 
47.12.020.  The only exception to this occurs when a minor is arrested for a 
violation of a traffic law, in which case, the Minor is processed as an adult with 
the detention facility being McLaughlin Youth Center.  (There are Fish & Game 
and Parks & Recreation crimes where the juvenile is also treated as an adult, 
however, these are rare and would need further guidance.) 

The procedure ―Juveniles—General‖ has a section ―Understanding the Juvenile 
Justice System‖ which gives a more complete discussion of this topic.  

DEFINITIONS 

Delinquent Act:  An act or omission by a minor that could result in 
institutionalization. 

Adjudication:  The classification of the juvenile matter.  There are two 
adjudications the court system deals with:  

Delinquency:  That category of juvenile matters wherein the minor commits 
delinquent acts (acts that would be criminal if committed by an adult).  If a 
minor is found responsible for such act(s) in Family Court (another name for 
Juvenile Court), the court can officially ―adjudicate‖ (i.e. label) the juvenile ―a 
delinquent minor.‖  That adjudication permits the court to enter an order of 
institutionalization. 

Child in Need of Aid (―CINA‖):  That category of juvenile matters wherein the 
minor is the subject of abuse or neglect, or is in need of special care not 

 

  

provided by the legal guardians.  A child in need of aid cannot be 
institutionalized by the courts.  

Waiver:  The placing of what would normally be a juvenile matter into the adult 
criminal court system.  There are two ways in which this can occur: 

Court Determination:  A process by which the Family Court is petitioned to 
remove a juvenile delinquency proceeding from that jurisdiction and place it 
into the adult criminal court system.  

Automatic Waiver:  A legal provision that mandates any juvenile, age 16 or 
over, who commits an Unclassified felony, a Class A felony, or Arson, be 
automatically waived to adult status.  No family Court Waiver Hearing is 
required.   

Disposition:  The general equivalent of sentencing in adult court.  With minors, 
five dispositions are possible if a minor is found responsible for a delinquent act: 

Adjudication Held in Abeyance.   

Restitution.  In some cases, the juvenile will be required by the court to fulfill 
restitution by either paying a fine or completing community service.  Often 
time‘s restitution is required with other forms of dispositions, however, it can 
also be a disposition in and of itself. 

Probation.  Defined identically to that of adult probation, in that a period of 
supervised behavior is imposed in lieu of institutionalization.  The supervision 
is provided by Juvenile Probation.   

Foster Care.  The Family Court may determine that the delinquent behavior is 
generated by a deficient family situation, and order the minor placed in either 
group or individual family foster care. 

Institutionalization.  The Family Court may believe that the behavior of a 
minor is such that full treatment in a secure setting is in the juvenile‘s and 
society‘s best interests, and order custody of the minor remanded to the 
Commissioner of Health and Social Services for further placement into an 
institution for two years, or until the minor‘s nineteenth birthday.  Since the 
placement is for treatment rather than punishment, no specific period of 
institutionalization is imposed.  The institution, through regular reports, 
determines when the juvenile has been rehabilitated.  

Custody:  In this procedure, two possible definitions occur: 

Any Restraint of Liberty.  See ―Custody—General‖ (3.02.005) for full 
discussion.   

Specific for Juveniles—―Custody‖ means responsibility TO and FOR the 
minor, and does not imply restraint of any sort.  An officer taking custody of a 
minor limits that child‘s freedom, while a ―custodian‖ who takes legal custody 
of a minor cares for that child and discharges all responsibilities of a guardian.   

Status Offense:  A type of offense that can only be committed by people of a 
certain ―status.‖  In juvenile law, it is the term identifying the laws that pertain 

  

exclusively to minors, and includes truancy, runaway, curfew, alcohol violations, 
and others.   

Some status offenses, most notably the alcohol violations found in Alaska Statute 
04, define a minor differently than those being under 18 years old.

REFERENCES 

PROCEDURE 

I. TYPES OF ―ARRESTS‖ 

A. Warrant Arrests. 

1. Detention Order.  A Detention order is the juvenile equivalent to an 
adult arrest warrant.  The most significant difference, other than 
appearance of the form, is that bail is not set on such an order, so that any 
juvenile so arrested is transported directly to McLaughlin Youth Center 
and booked without bail.  Detention Order‘s are obtained from Juvenile 
Probations. 

2. Misdemeanor or Felony Warrants. Technically Misdemeanor and 
Felony Warrants only apply to adults, however, in the rare cases where 
the Anchorage Police Department will apply for the detention of a juvenile, 
the request can be made on the adult warrant paperwork. 

3. Misdemeanor Crimes.  Typically Detention Order‘s are applied for by 
Juvenile Probations and not the Anchorage Police Department, unless the 
crime is involving Domestic Violence (see Domestic Violence Response 
and Investigation). 

4. Felony Crimes.  Anchorage Police Officer‘s are not to apply for Felony 
arrest warrants for juveniles unless the crime is involving Domestic 
Violence or they have been directed to do so by a field supervisor or 
detective in the respective area of the crime. 

5. When a juvenile arrest warrant is applied for from the Magistrate, the 
applying officer shall respectfully remind the issuing Magistrate that the 
warrant is for a juvenile, requiring juvenile case numbers, and should be 
no bail. 

B. Warrantless Arrests—Misdemeanors. 

1. Arrest by officers for: 

a). Misdemeanor offense(s) committed in their presence; or 

b). Based on probable cause, developed by themselves or by other 
officers through investigation, if, and only if the subject misdemeanor 
is: 

  

i. A Driving Under the Influence violation occurring within the 
preceding 4 hours (see Driving Under the Influence); or 

ii. A violation of the Domestic Violence provisions, which specifically 
entitle officers to arrest on probable cause (see Domestic Violence 
Response and Investigation, for details).  

2. Private Person‘s Arrest.  A private person is empowered to arrest 
anyone who commits an offense in their presence, whether that person is 
a juvenile or adult.  (see ―Arrests—Private Persons‘,‖ for details).  

C. Warrantless Arrests—Felony. 

1. By officers for an offense committed in their presence. 

2. By officers, based on probable cause, and normally established by an 
investigation conducted by any officer. 

3. Private Person Arrest.  Though allowed by law, it is not Department 
policy to accept a Private person arrest of a felon.  Instead, the 
complainant is interviewed to establish probable cause, and if sufficient, 
officers make the arrest. 

II. EXECUTING THE ―ARREST‖ 

Note:  Since many juvenile matters (e.g. traffic arrests, felony arrests, waivers) 
overlap with the adult process, confusion can arise as to where and how to book 
a juvenile.  One simple rule can guide officers: Unless some legal authority 
specifically and clearly directs otherwise, all persons under the age of 18 years 
will be booked into the McLaughlin Youth Center.  

A. Warrant Arrests 

1. Detention order 

a). In executing any ―warrant‖ type arrest, the two most critical 
elements for officers are: 

i. Establishing positive identity of the person named on the 
document; and  

ii. Ensuring the validity of the document.  

b). If both elements meet the officer‘s satisfaction, the subject is 
arrested in the conventional manner (consult ―In-Custody Transports‖ 
procedure, for expansion on the topics of restraint, search, and 
transport subsequent to arrest). 

c). No appearance before a magistrate is required prior to booking, as 
the function of the magistrate has been previously satisfied by the 
issuing judicial officer.  On booking at McLaughlin Youth Center, the 
juvenile Intake system is triggered to arrange subsequent hearings 
and/or release. 

  

d). The Detention Order is a judicial order compelling a peace officer to 
take the named subject into custody.  Officers may, however, select 
the time and location for executing the order.   

e). Since all Detention Orders issue from the State Superior Court, any 
Detention Order can be executed by an Anchorage Police Department 
officer. 

B. Warrantless Arrests—Misdemeanor 

1. By officers, in their presence. 

a). All sworn members of the Anchorage Police Department, whether 
on or off duty, within the boundaries of the Municipality (including all 
Federal Property, and on military reservations), may effect an arrest as 
a police officer for any misdemeanor committed in their presence. 

b). Arrest techniques are conventional (see ―In-Custody Transports‖, 
which describes restraint, search, and transport procedure and policy). 

c). A substantial effort will be made to notify the juvenile‘s legal 
custodian(s) of the arrest.  These efforts will be explicitly documented 
in the Police Report.  

d). Juveniles will not be transported with adults unless that adult is 
related to the minor.   

e). Officer‘s shall consult MYC prior to releasing a juvenile directly to 
his/her legal custodian.  If MYC will accept the juvenile, the juvenile 
shall be transported to MYC, if not; the juvenile can be released to a 
guardian.   

The only misdemeanor arrests that MYC cannot refuse to take are 
D.V. arrest and warrant/detention order arrest.  In these cases, a call to 
MYC is still warranted. 

2. By officers—based on probable cause. 

a). As discussed earlier, there are two misdemeanor offenses for which 
officers can arrest based on probable cause, established by their own 
observations or by citizen‘s observations.  They are: 

i. Driving Under the Influence if that offense occurred within the 
preceding 4 hours; and 

ii. Violation of the Domestic Violence Provisions. 

b). Should officers arrest a juvenile for Driving Under the Influence, the 
minor would be handled as an adult, including appearance before a 
magistrate.  The two issues unique to juvenile DUI arrests are: 

i. All reasonable attempts should be made to notify the juvenile‘s 
parents of the arrest, although their presence is not required; and 

ii. If remanded by the magistrate, the minor would be processed 
into McLaughlin Youth Center. 

  

c). Should officers arrest a juvenile for violation of a Domestic Violence 
provision, the case should be processed as a juvenile misdemeanor 
offense, as described above. 

d). In assuming responsibility for a citizen‘s arrest, officers should 
conduct the process as described in sections ―I.B.1.b‖ and ―B.1.‖ of this 
procedure.  A review of the steps would be: 

i. Take custody of the arrested minor. 

ii. Make or cause notification of the minor‘s legal custodian(s). 

iii. Transport the minor as outlined in the procedure ―In-Custody 
Transports‖.  Destinations could include: 

(1). To the minor‘s home for release; or 

(2). To Covenant House for release if a custodian cannot be 
reached. 

(3). To the station for further processing, investigation, staging 
point for contact with custodians or detectives, etc.; or 

(4). To McLaughlin Youth Center for booking if a Detention 
Order is in existence and/or if MYC will accept the juvenile. 

e). Complete and submit the Police Report, a copy of which is 
forwarded by Record Division to juvenile Intake Office for consideration 
of possible prosecution or informal resolution.   

C. Warrantless Arrests—Felony 

1. Any felony arrest can be made if the offense is committed either in the 
officer‘s presence, or by probable cause established by any officer.   

a). Officers should coordinate their activities with the Detective Section 
as well.  See Section C. of ‗Arrests—Felony‖. 

b). Officers must closely consider the appropriateness of the arrest.  
Guidelines on making that determination can be found in ―Arrests—
Felony‖ Section D. 

III. INTERVIEWING JUVENILES 

A. An interview of a juvenile suspect is conducted as an adult interview would 
be, with the following additional considerations: 

1. The juvenile‘s legal custodian(s) must be notified of the arrest and, if 
applicable, the intent to interview their ward.  Although Alaska Statute 
47.12.245 requires that this be done within 12 hours of detaining the 
juvenile, this shall be done as soon as practical.  Every reasonable effort 
will be afforded that custodian to attend the interview if only after being 
advised of this right, the juvenile wants a parent, guardian, and/or an 
attorney to attend.  There is no legal mandate to have a parent or attorney 
present while the juvenile is being interrogated so long as the juvenile has 
been advised of his/her Miranda Rights as well as the right to have a 

  

parent present and have waived that right.  If the detained juvenile 
requests to speak with a parent, that request must be met the same as if 
the juvenile was requesting to speak to their attorney.   

2. Juvenile suspects must be advised of their Constitutional Rights 
(Miranda) if custodial interrogation is to be conducted.  Any suspect may 
waive those rights, but that waiver must be done: 

a). Knowingly—meaning no trickery or deceit; and 

b). Voluntarily—meaning no force or coercion, and 

c). Intelligently—meaning the full significance of what is being waived 
must be appreciated. 

3. In addition to the ―typical‖ Miranda advisement, juveniles must be asked 
two additional questions: 

a). ―You have the right to have your parent notified of your arrest 
before you talk to me.‖ 

b). ―You have the right to have your parent present while you talk to 
me.‖ 

4. The government has the burden of proving the three standards listed 
above are met.  With juveniles, the standards are identical, but the burden 
of proof is more strict.  Courts and juries are inclined to see juveniles as 
easily intimidated, easily tricked, and not always aware of the significance 
of what they do.  As such, officers must go to extra lengths to insure 
statements are acceptable.  Toward that end, the following is offered: 

a). Custodial interviews, including Miranda, will be audio recorded in 
their entirety. 

b). The most significant feature to consider is the minor‘s maturity and 
experience with the law enforcement system, often referred to in legal 
circles as the minor‘s ―sophistication‖.  The more sophisticated the 
minor, the more closely he or she approaches the adult procedure.  
However, an unsophisticated minor demands substantial effort on the 
officer‘s part to correctly conduct an interview and investigation.  The 
officer is encouraged to: 

i. Explain in detail the process(es) to which the minor may be 
subject.   

ii. Make and document substantial effort to contact guardian(s). 

iii. Fully explain the rights advised under Miranda when appropriate 
to give any such advisement.   

IV. RELEASE AFTER ARREST 

A. Directive to Contact Juvenile Intake.  Whenever a juvenile is released to a 
parent/guardian after arrest for a Municipal or State criminal law violation, 
both the juvenile and the parent/guardian must be issued a ―Directive to 

  

Contact Juvenile Intake‖ form.  This order provides immediate notification that 
Juvenile intake must be contacted the next business day to schedule an 
interview regarding the arrest.  The following procedures will be used to 
complete, issue, and distribute the form: 

1. Place the name and date of birth of the juvenile in the ―In The Matter 
Of:‖ box at the top left of the form.   

2. Write the date of issue and the Police Report number at the top right of 
the form.   

3. Obtain the signatures of the juvenile and the parent/guardian in the 
appropriate blocks.  

4. Ensure that the parent is aware of the Intake phone number, noted on 
the form. 

5. Distribute as follows: 

a). Original—attached to the Police Report. 

b). Yellow—Juvenile Intake. 

c. Pink—Juvenile 

d. Goldenrod--Parent 

NOTE:  This form should not be used if the juvenile is detained at the McLaughlin 
Youth Center, or when cited for curfew, alcohol, tobacco, traffic, or Fish and 
Game violations.

3.02.060  In Custody Transports 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

To describe procedures which ensure the security of prisoners and the physical 
protection of all parties, while minimizing allegations of officer misconduct. 

Recognizing that the time of arrest and transport is an extraordinarily dangerous 
phase of police operation (both physically and civilly), it is the Department's 
policy to employ procedures that defeat opportunity for escape, injury, or 
accusations of misconduct. 

I. RESTRAINTS 

PROCEDURES 

A. Department approved restraints include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 

1. Standard chain handcuffs. 

2. "Flex-Cuffs," provided tool(s) for removal are carried by officers. 

3. Patrol car with prisoner screen and locking rear doors. 

4. Soft restraints (usually provided by the Anchorage Fire Department), 
including: 

a). Padded cuffs 

b). Straight jackets 

5. Belly chains (see Warrants Section unit procedure). 

6. Leg Restraints and Total Leg Restraints 

B. When restraints are to be used 

1. All persons placed in any form of custody shall be searched prior to 
transport.  Officers have discretion in how much restraint to use providing: 

 

  

a). As a general rule, all people being transported who are in custody 
will be handcuffed. 

b). Age, gender, and physical or mental condition of a person can be 
used in conjunction with the surrounding circumstances to determine 
whether a person is to be handcuffed. 

c). Officers shall use sufficient restraint to maintain control of any 
person in custody. 

d). Any person placed in custody under circumstances suggesting 
violence or escape risk shall always be restrained with traditional metal 
handcuffs. 

C. Proper use of restraints 

1. Any restraint must be applied humanely. 

2. Handcuffs 

a). Handcuffs are the primary restraining device. 

b). All handcuffing shall be applied consistent with APD training and 
with the handcuffs double locked. 

c). Officers should note in their reports that the handcuffs were 
checked for fit and double locked.  This can be noted in the report as 
CF/DL, or ―checked fit/ double locked.‖ 

d). When handcuffing two people together, cuff the right hand of one 
subject to the left hand of the other ("cross-cuff"). 

e). The only immovable object that a subject may be handcuffed to is 
an apparatus specifically designated as a restraint device.  
Handcuffing to any vehicle is prohibited. 

f). Should a subject complain of any pain associated with the 
handcuffs, officers shall inspect and ensure that the handcuffs are not 
causing injury as soon as practical.  This check and any corrective 
actions should be noted in the officer‘s report. 

3. Flex-cuffs. 

a). Flex-cuffs are regarded as secondary restraining devices and 
should only be used under special circumstances or when traditional 
metal handcuffs are not available. 

b). The use of Department-approved flex-cuffs is authorized, providing 
tools for removal are readily available to the officer using them. 

c). Should a subject complain of any pain associated with the 
handcuffs, officers shall inspect and ensure that the cuffs are not 
causing injury as soon as practical.  This check and any corrective 
actions should be noted in the officer‘s report. 

4. Police vehicles with prisoner screen and locking rear doors. 

  

a). Providing the standards for required restraint are met (see I. B. a. of 
this procedure), officers may elect to place the searched subject, not 
handcuffed, in the right rear seat of the vehicle, screen up and doors 
locked. 

5. Soft restraints (padded cuffs and straight jackets). 

a). The Anchorage Fire Department can provide soft restraints to 
enhance safety and humane treatment in the transport of mentally ill 
subjects. 

6. Leg restraints 

a). Certain situations may require further restraint of a subject who 
continues to be combative after being handcuffed.  If total leg restraints 
are used and attached behind the person‘s back in any manner, the 
subject shall be monitored at all times. A supervisor will be notified 
immediately and a second officer must ride in the police vehicle and 
monitor the subject. The use of leg restraints will be documented in the 
police report. 

b). Any use of leg restraints will be in accordance with current 
Defensive Tactics training guidelines. 

II. PROTECTIVE SEARCHES 

A. Purpose:  Protective searches are conducted to find any dangerous item(s) 
prior to transporting.  This is to ensure: 

1. Officers' safety; and 

2. The safety of transported subjects (from self-inflicted harm and injuries 
from struggles to disarm); and 

3. The safety of the public (from escape and escalation of events). 

B. Importance:  The public depends on officers to ensure their safety. In 
nearly all instances, the person being transported does not want to be in 
custody, and officers should eliminate opportunities for damage to property or 
injury to the person being transported or the public at large. This is best 
accomplished by: 

1. Proper restraint; and 

2. Proper searching. 

C. Description of Protective Searches:  A protective search has to be 
distinguished from a search for evidence of a crime.  The intent of a protective 
search is to find weapons, so the scope is limited.  If evidence happens to be 
found, it may still be admissible only if the item found was believed to be a 
weapon.  Protective search cannot be used as a ruse for a quest for 
evidence. 

D. Description of "In-Custody":  It is reiterated that this procedure addresses 
any person brought into custody for any reason, and does not limit itself to 

  

arrested individuals only.  "In-custody" includes runaway juveniles being 
transported home, and other forms of protective custody. 

E. Searching Standards:   

1. The extent of the search will be governed by the circumstances of the 
custody and the gender of the person being searched, but not by age.  
Specifically: 

a). Juveniles shall be searched. 

b). Females should be searched by female officers. If impractical, the 
search shall be conducted in the presence of another available officer, 
or, in front of a police vehicle equipped with a police video camera, or, 
in front of a credible citizen witness (e.g. an AFD employee, police 
chaplain, etc.). The search will be documented in a police report or in 
CAD. The witness officer‘s name or the witness citizen‘s name and 
contact information will also be included. Female officers searching a 
male are exempt from this section.  

c). Limit all searches of the opposite gender to the minimum 
necessary. 

d). Should a female who is under arrest or otherwise detained by a 
male officer ask for a female officer, the male officer shall contact 
Dispatch and make that request. It is Department policy that, if a 
female officer is available, every reasonable effort must be made to 
dispatch the female officer to the scene. The female officer shall 
remain with the detained subject until the conclusion of the call. The 
same policy applies when a male under arrest or being detained by a 
female officer asks that a male officer be present. 

e). Should it be necessary in an emergency situation to search a 
person of the opposite gender without another officer present, a 
supervisor will be notified immediately and the action will be 
electronically recorded and documented in the police report. 

2. Dangerous objects, bags, purses, backpacks, apparel, jewelry and 
similar articles that pose a potential threat to self or others fall under 
standard search conditions and will be separated from the individual 
during transport.  

3. Vehicles used for transport shall be searched both before and after an 
in-custody transport.   

III. TRANSPORTING--GENERAL POLICIES 

A. Conversation 

General conversation should be limited. Issues regarding questioning in the 
vehicle, taping conversations and other investigative matters should be 
researched in the procedure "Investigations--Interviews". Certain 

  

conversations initiated by the person in custody can be used as evidence, 
even without prior Miranda warnings. 

B. Responding to Other Calls:  Do not respond to other calls with a person in 
custody in the vehicle. Occasionally, while transporting, officers will view an 
incident requiring police attention. In those events, response is appropriate, 
but should be minimized. 

1. In no event will officers participate in a "code run" with an in-custody on 
board. 

2. Any such "on-view" police action should not expose the in-custody 
subject to danger. 

C. Reducing the Potential for Allegations of Misconduct:  To avoid potential 
allegations of misconduct during transport, the following guidelines should be 
observed: 

1. Drive well-traveled, well-illuminated routes. 

2. When transporting juveniles or persons of the opposite gender, advise 
Dispatch of your location, starting/ending mileage, and destination.  

3). Should it be necessary to stop at a substation or make any other 
unscheduled stop while transporting a person of the opposite gender, 
supervisor notification will be necessary and two officers will be present at 
all times. The event will be documented in the police report to include the 
supervisor and witnessing officers‘ names. 

4. Avoid verbal confrontations. 

5. Whenever a female is transported by a male officer, the transport itself 
shall be audio-recorded from beginning to end, downloaded into DIMS, 
and attached to a case number or incident number before the end of that 
officer‘s tour of duty during which the transport occurred. 

6. Should the subject‘s conversation suggest bribes, threats, retribution, 
sexual acts, or other matters of concern, officers shall: 

a). Notify a supervisor immediately; and 

b). Document the conversation in a police report. 

7. Do not delay en route. 

D. Communications Security 

1. When transporting a person in custody, take the radio off of the "scan" 
mode and monitor the main channel.  This is to prevent the transported 
subject from hearing sensitive radio traffic. 

2. The MDC screen should be positioned to avoid viewing by subjects. 

3. Use of Seatbelts:  Whenever practical, seatbelts should worn by 
persons in custody while being transported.  Use the prisoner restraint 
system if the vehicle is so equipped. 

  

IV. TRANSPORTING 

A. General: Transports shall not occur until after the person and the police 
vehicle are searched.   

B. Guidelines on Positioning In-Custody Persons in the Vehicle.  The 
following guidelines shall be followed when positioning a person who is in 
custody in a police vehicle: 

1. Officers should avoid transporting prisoners who are not handcuffed. If 
the situation cannot be avoided, the prisoner may be transported in the 
rear seat, but only if the protective screen is up. 

2. If two officers are using a car without a protective screen, one officer will 
ride in the rear seat with the prisoner. 

3. Without a screen or a second officer, do not transport two people in 
custody in one car. 

V. TRANSPORTING--SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES 

  

A. Juveniles 

1. Do not transport juveniles with adults not related to that minor. 

2. Transporting juveniles is indistinguishable from transporting an adult, 
including searches. 

B. Mentally Ill 

1. Soft restraints can be used if necessary. 

2. No standards are to be relaxed when transporting mentally ill subjects.  
Searches and restraints are appropriate.

3.02.065  Investigation- Interviews 

To advise all sworn personnel of the interviewing standards and techniques 
acceptable to the Department. 

It is Department policy to conduct interviews in a professional, efficient manner, 
while complying with prevailing legal standards. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

When a crime is committed, the public looks to the police to find who is 
responsible for the act, and to bring that person to prosecution.  Both steps rely 
on various police skills, the most fundamental of which are finding and seizing 
both physical and testimonial evidence. 

This procedure is about interviewing--the "seizing of testimonial evidence."  
Effective interviewing is a combination of personal technique and compliance 
with all legal standards--even the best style of interviewing is useless if legal 
standards are not met.  This procedure highlights those standards, allowing 
officers to employ their preferred style in a legally acceptable manner. 

DEFINITIONS 

Interview:  For purposes of this procedure, a probative inquiry of any person.   

Miranda:  A term referring to the case law requirements set out in the Miranda vs. 
Arizona decision.  "Miranda" imposes a duty on the police to advise any suspect 
being questioned while "in custody" of certain Constitutional protections, 
specifically: 

You have the right to remain silent. 

Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. 

You have the right to talk to a lawyer and have him present with you while you 
are being questioned. 

  

If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you 
before any questioning, if you wish. 

You can decide at any time to exercise these rights and not answer any 
questions or make any statements." 

After the warning and in order to secure a waiver, the officer shall insure that the 
suspect in custody both understands the rights explained to him/her, and is, in 
fact, willing to talk with the interviewer.  

Custodial Questioning:  The interviewing of a suspect by a police officer any time 
that suspect is "in custody."  The significance of this condition is that it invokes 
the requirements of Miranda--that is, whenever custodial questioning is to occur, 
suspects must first be advised of their Constitutional rights as specified in 
Miranda (see the definition of Miranda above).  It is essential that officers make a 
distinction between "custody" as it applies to "custodial questioning," and as it is 
used in the Arrest and Custody chapter of this Regulations and Procedures 
Manual: 

"Custody," when used alone, is the restraint of anyone's liberty by anyone 
else (See 3.02.045). 

The type of custody referred to in "Custodial Questioning" is more specific.  It 
is the state of mind of the suspect, and is whenever a reasonable person, in 
the suspect's position and in light of the totality of the circumstances, could 
reasonably feel that their liberty is restrained in some significant way.  
Therefore, for custodial questioning to occur, the following elements must be 
present: 

1. The police must be conducting 

2. an interview of 

3. a crime suspect 

4. while that suspect is "in custody," with "custody" being specifically 
defined in case law as a significant restraint of liberty as viewed by a 
reasonable person. 

If all elements are met, the suspect must be warned of the Constitutional rights 
against self incrimination as required in the Miranda decision. 

Harris vs. State of Alaska.  The "Harris" decision requires that police officers 
electronically record, in their entirety, all interviews of suspects "in custody in a 
place of detention."  The concept of custody is explained in the preceding 
definition.  "Place of detention" is normally construed as a jail or police station, 
and includes patrol vehicles if custodial questioning occurs there.

3.02.070  Investigations--Use of Informants 

To advise all personnel of the Anchorage Police Department's standards and 
methodology for the recruitment, tracking, and use of informants, and the 
management of the information they provide. 

That responsible use of informants for the furtherance of the police mission is 
authorized, but only if such use, and the management of information gained, is 
conducted in a safe and legal fashion. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

The proper use of informants is recognized as a legitimate law enforcement tool, 
but is difficult to manage, subject to abuse, and can be hazardous to officers.  
Consequently, clear and firm guidelines must be established to control the use of 
informants, and manage the information they provide.  This procedure sets out to 
do just that, but with a caveat--this procedure is not a training manual on 
informants.  It presumes officers are competent in such techniques as methods 
of recruitment, legal standards of informant reliability, fundamental investigative 
techniques, and related topics. 

DEFINITIONS 

Information:  For purposes of this procedure, "information" is any material 
discovered by or provided to any member of a law enforcement agency that 
pertains to the overall police mission. 

Informant:  For purposes of this procedure, an informant is any non-law 
enforcement person who, by reason of his/her familiarity or close association with 
criminals, supplies regular or constant information about criminal activities to a 
police officer.  An informant is distinguished from routine sources of information 
(witnesses, complainants, interviewees) in that an informant requires procedures 

  

and techniques beyond those of a more typical source.  Within this procedure, 
four types of informants are recognized: 

A. Occasional Informant.  A person who sometimes provides investigative 
leads when contacted, but will not participate in any regular pattern of 
reporting information. There is usually no sworn testimony or appearance in 
court.  Certain anonymous callers can fit in this category. 

B. Arrested Informant.  A person who provides information about criminal 
associates in order to minimize their own prosecution.  This "negotiated" 
information is typically on a one-time basis, and testimony in court is not 
unusual.  Negotiation is conducted under the auspices of the prosecuting 
authority, not solely by the police. 

C. Regular/Constant Informant.  A person who, typically, is a member of a 
criminal group or a close associate of criminals, and routinely supplies 
information to the police.  Motivations vary, but can include information for 
payment. 

D. Special Informant.  A person who participates in (a) police operation(s) 
beyond the mere supplying of information.  This person might actively assist 
an undercover agent in the penetration of a criminal organization, and/or sets 
up buys.  This type of informant may ultimately require police 
protection/relocation assistance, as court testimony is normal in these 
instances.  This application of informant requires close attention to procedure, 
as it is most subject to that informant becoming an "agent of the police," 
thereby triggering different legal standards.

of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance

3.02.075  Investigations-Warrants/Summons/Subpoenas 

To advise all employees of the processes affecting arrest and search warrants, 
and the various summons/subpoenas encountered in law enforcement. 

PURPOSE 

DISCUSSION 

The Constitution provides for a variety of "checks and balances" to ensure that 
no one branch of government becomes too strong, nor that the government in 
general intrude unnecessarily into the private lives of its citizens.  One such 
balancing process is the presumption that the police shall get authority from the 
courts for any search and/or arrest.  This is done by applying for a "warrant," and 
it is only in specifically and narrowly defined situations that an officer can make 
an arrest or conduct a search without a warrant.   

In practice, however, warrantless searches and arrests seem to be the rule 
instead of the exception--that is, on a day-to-day basis, officers operate often and 
routinely in the "specific and narrowly defined situations" which allow exclusion 
from the warrant requirements.  The end result is that some officers come to 
regard petitioning for warrants as an infrequently used process that is applied 
only in the most complex cases.  This procedure will assist officers in determining 
when and how to petition for those documents. 

DEFINITIONS 

Warrant:  For purposes of this procedure, a judicial authorization to do 
something.  In law enforcement, the most common types of warrants are: 

Arrest Warrants:  Which authorize the government (usually represented by the 
police) to seize person(s); and 

Search Warrants:  Which authorize the government (usually represented by the 
police) to search a person or place and seize certain property. 

  

Probable Cause--Arrest Warrants:  That level of proof which exists if the facts 
and circumstances known to the officer would warrant a prudent man in believing 
that an offense had been or was being committed, and that the person to be 
arrested is responsible. 

Probable Cause--Search Warrants:  The sufficiency of information required to 
permit the conclusion that criminal activity or evidence of crime will be found at 
the place to be searched. 

Summons:  For purposes of this procedure, a command to appear in court for 
arraignment. 

Subpoena:  For purposes of this procedure, a command, under penalty, for either 
a person to appear in court, and/or a person to appear in court with documents or 
other material. 

PROCEDURE 

I. ARREST WARRANTS AND SUMMONS 

A. Types of Arrest Warrants.   

1. Arrest Warrants. 

a). Misdemeanor Arrest Warrants. 

b). Felony Arrest Warrants. 

c). Traffic Arrest Warrants (actually a misdemeanor warrant for "failure 
to appear" or other deficiency). 

d). Juvenile Detention Orders. 

e). Ex-Parte Orders (normally for mental commitments). 

B. Sources of Arrest Warrants.  Warrants originate from two broad sources: 

1. Warrants which result from an investigation, where application is made 
to the courts for authority to arrest or search; or 

2. Warrants issued by the court itself, known as "Bench Warrants."  These 
warrants are normally issued as a result of a defendant's failure to perform 
some required act, so are almost always arrest warrants.  Commonly, 
these are: 

a). Failure to Appear (FA). 

b). Contempt of Court (COC). 

c). Failure to Satisfy (FTS). 

d). Failure to Comply (FTC). 

e). Violation of Conditions of Release (VCR). 

f). Probation/Parole Revocation. 

C. Warrant and Summons Application--Misdemeanors. 

  

1. General Processing.  Any peace officer can apply for a warrant or, as 
mentioned, a court may issue a warrant on its own initiative.  Once issued, 
a warrant may be immediately served by a police officer (a private person 
cannot serve a warrant).  Officers need only to know a warrant exists, 
either through personal knowledge or, more typically, through "police 
information" (usually a computer information system). 

2. Application procedure for misdemeanor warrants or summons through 
the judicial system.  When officers apply for a misdemeanor warrant or 
summons, the following procedure shall apply.  Note that paragraph "3" of 
this section identifies the Misdemeanor Citation as an officer-issued 
summons, as contrasted with this judicially -issued document. 

a). Municipal misdemeanor warrant/summons application (see II. B, for 
State misdemeanor warrant/summons applications): 

i. Ensure the investigation is complete. 

ii. Prepare a Complaint as normal.  Be alert to the following: 

(1). Supply ample "probable cause" in the designated area of 
the Complaint. 

(2). The reverse side of the Complaint is the application for 
either a Summons (which does not allow an arrest, but serves to 
advise the defendant of the court date and charges) or a 
Warrant (which does require/allow an arrest to ensure the 
defendant will appear). 

iii. The Municipal Prosecutor's Office will be furnished with the full 
Police Report and Complaint for review of accuracy, clarity, and 
legal sufficiency. 

iv. After the Municipal Prosecutor reviews, approves, and initials the 
package, officers will proceed to the State Court Building to contact 
a judge or magistrate. 

(1). The Complaint will be signed and sworn to before that 
judicial officer; and 

(2). There will be a determination made of whether a summons 
or warrant shall issue; and 

(3). The judicial officer will fill out the back of the Complaint as 
appropriate to a summons or warrant. 

  Note:  If a warrant is issued, bail will be set and entered on the document, 
but no court date will be specified as the defendant is not yet in custody. 

If a summons is issued, a hearing date is set, but bail is not an issue.  Recall 
that a summons is used when there is no reason to believe the defendant 
should be arrested--the person is merely advised of the court date and is 

However, 

  

expected to appear.  A summons specifies the court date, and is served on 
the defendant to ensure he or she is in receipt of both the charges and the 
date to appear in court. 

v. Officers will deliver or cause to be delivered the finalized 
documents to the Clerk of Courts, where they will be processed. 

vii. After filing with the Clerk of Courts, officers may deliver the 
appropriate documents to the Warrants Section to expedite entry of 
the warrant into the computer or, in the case of a summons, to 
ensure expedient service. 

b). State misdemeanor warrant application (See I.A, above for 
Municipal application, and section D. for State felony application).  The 
application for summons or warrant for a State violation is nearly 
identical to that of a Municipal application.  

i. Ensure the investigation is complete. 

ii. Contact the intake District Attorney.  The case will be reviewed 
with that person and, if a summons or warrant is appropriate, that 
office will prepare the document. 

iii. The applying officer will then take the material to the State Court 
Building for signing before a judicial officer and subsequent 
handling, as described above under the Municipal procedure. 

3. Officer-issued summons.  Recall that officers may issue a summons for 
certain violators to appear in court on certain misdemeanors.  This occurs 
when officers issue a Misdemeanor Citation.  That process is fully 
discussed in the procedure of that same title, and is included here for 
reiteration. 

D. Felony Warrant or Summons Application Procedure.  Applying for felony 
warrants/summons differs from its misdemeanor counterpart only because 
the prosecuting agency changes to the District Attorney's Office.  The 
principle remains the same, however, and the following guidelines apply: 

1. Ensure the case is complete. 

2. Arrange to meet with a District Attorney to discuss the case.  The report 
will be reviewed for clarity, accuracy, and completeness, and the case will 
be reviewed for both legal sufficiency and foundation for warrant/summons 
issuance. 

3. If approved, the District Attorney will prepare: 

a). An affidavit setting out the probable cause; and 

b). A Summons/Warrant form similar to what appears on the reverse 
side of the Complaint in misdemeanor cases. 

4. Officers will then take the package to an available judge or magistrate, 
where the affidavit will be sworn to, and the case considered. 

  

5. That judicial officer will ascertain if a warrant or summons is 
appropriate, and: 

a). If a warrant, establish a bail amount, but no court date. 

b). If a summons, establish a court date only, as bail is inappropriate. 

6. Officers will then take the finalized package to the Clerk of Courts, 
where the documents will be certified and processed. 

7. Officers may deliver the appropriate documents to the Judicial Services 
(JS) Section of the Alaska State Troopers to allow a more expeditious 
entry of the warrant into the computer or, in the rare case of a summons, 
ensure more expedient service. 

E. Summons Application Procedure--Infraction.  Officers will normally issue a 
Uniform Summons and Complaint for an infraction in the field at the time of 
the incident.  However, there are situations which lead to charging an 
infraction at a later time, such as at the conclusion of a traffic accident 
investigation, or an investigation of Misconduct Involving a Controlled 
Substance in the seventh degree.  Notice there is a difference between this 
process and officer-initiated issuance of a misdemeanor summons by way of 
a Misdemeanor Citation.  Should officers need to summon a person for an 
infraction, the following guidelines shall apply: 

1. Properly complete the Uniform Summons and Complaint form.   

Note: 

a). As the name implies, that form acts as both the charging document 
and the formal summons to appear in court. 

b). The date to appear in court shall be in compliance with the "points 
and bail forfeiture schedule" furnished the officer. 

i. Normally this would be "Within five working days" for infractions 
(technically, there is one exception to this--"Within 15 days" for 
charging the infraction of littering under AS 46.06.080.  Charging 
under this statute, if ever appropriate, would only be when the 
amount of litter is under 5 pounds.  See "Calls for Service--
Littering", 3.01.080, for details); or 

ii. "Inspectable within seven days at 4501 Elmore" for most 
inspectable equipment violations.  The exceptions within this 
section (AMC 9.44) are: 

(1). Excessive exhaust smoke, which is inspectable by 
contacting the Inspection Referee Facility at 561-3111 within 10 
days of receiving the citation to make an appointment for 
inspection; and 

(2). Excessive exhaust noise, which is inspectable within 10 
days at the Department of Environmental Quality, 825 L Street, 
during normal business hours. 

  

2. Take the Uniform Summons and Complaint to the Traffic division of the 
Court system.  A clerk will take the citation and arrange for service.  Since 
the complaint is for an infraction, no judicial review is required, and the 
citation itself acts as a summons. 

II. SEARCH WARRANTS 

A. General.  Search warrants are judicial authorizations to search persons or 
property, and to seize certain property as a result of that search.  Note that, in 
Alaska, there is a special requirement for seizing conversation, as described 
in the Glass decision.  Warrants for such seizures are known as "Glass 
Warrants." 

B. Sources of Search Warrants.  Search warrants are normally the result of 
police application only, and not on the initiative of the "bench" (judiciary) as 
commonly found in arrest warrants. 

C. Application for Search Warrants.   

1. Method.  Officers will normally seek a search warrant by: 

a). Telephone.  This is appropriate for emergency authorization to 
search; or 

b). Appearing in person to swear to the affidavit.  Most cases lack the 
urgency necessitating a telephonic search warrant, and personal 
application is appropriate.‘ 

2. Application.  When applying for a search warrant, officers should 
coordinate with the appropriate prosecuting agency.  Although 
misdemeanor search warrants are possible (most notably with Driving 
While Intoxicated cases), most search warrants are for felony offenses, 
and will be coordinated with the District Attorney's Office.  Officers should 
abide by the advice and instructions of that agency. 

D. Confidentiality and Reporting.  Alaska Rule of Criminal Procedure 37 
provides that: 

1. The record of all search warrant proceedings, and all documents related 
to those hearings, will be kept sealed unless the court orders otherwise for 
good cause shown; and 

2. Once charges are filed, however, those materials will be open to the 
public unless the court orders otherwise; and 

3. The State must list, by search warrant number, the search warrants that 
were executed during the course of the investigation.  To comply with this 
requirement, officers shall: 

a). Record the search warrant number(s) in the text of the Police 
Report; and 

  

b). Make available the search warrant number(s) to the screening 
prosecutor to facilitate the inclusion of those numbers in the probable 
cause statement of the charging document.

3.02.080 Juveniles--General 

To instruct all personnel in the procedural issues unique to juveniles. 

That all contacts with juveniles by employees of the Anchorage Police 
Department be accomplished in compliance with those provisions established for 
the protection of our State's minors. 

Minor/Child/Juvenile:  These terms are interchangeable and are often used 
synonymously.  They refer to any person who has not attained their 18th 
birthday.  However, several cautions are in order when using this definition: 

Modifications of Status.  A minor can legally be construed as an adult at the 
conclusion of either of two types of court action, or one legal provision: 

For criminal action, the court can "waive" a juvenile to adult status for the 
purpose of prosecuting (a) specific criminal act(s). 

For civil purposes, the court can "emancipate" a juvenile, thereby allowing 
that person to engage in various civil actions, including marriage and living 
outside of guardianship. 

For criminal purposes, State statute mandates any juvenile, age 16 or 
over, who commits an Unclassified felony, a Class A felony, or Arson, be 
automatically waived to adult status.  No Family Court Waiver Hearing is 
required. 

Other Definitions of "Minor."  In the Alaska Statutes (Title 04 - Alcohol 
Violations), certain provisions address minors-- "Minor Consuming Alcohol," 
"Minor on the Premises," "Minor in Possession of an Alcoholic Beverage," and 
"Furnishing Alcohol to a Minor," to name the most common.  It is essential to 
note that "minor," in these cases, refers to anyone under the age of 21 years.  

  

However, any person under 21 years of age can be charged (as an adult) 
with "Minor Consuming Alcohol," or one of the other provisions as 
appropriate. 

Family Court:  The court that hears all juvenile matters.  In Alaska, the Superior 
Court assumes responsibility and sits as Family Court, also known as Juvenile 
Court.  To assist the Superior Court, "Masters" are appointed to hear certain 
matters, subject to review by a Superior Court Judge. 

Custodian:  For purposes of this procedure, a general term for the person(s) 
responsible for a minor.  A custodian is most commonly the natural parent(s) of 
the child, but can also be the legal guardian or other court-appointed authority.  
Note, however: 

"Custody" has Two Meanings.  The term "custody" can have two meanings in 
juvenile law.  A child can be "brought into custody" in the usual sense of the 
word (restraint of liberty), or a person can "have custody of a minor," meaning 
he or she has responsibility to the minor and for the minor.  The term 
"custodian" is used to identify that person who has legal jurisdiction--that is, 
legal custody--of the child. 

Most information regarding juveniles can be found in Alaska Statute Title 47 and 
the Supreme Court's Rules of Court--Children's Rules. 

REFERENCES 

PROCEDURES 

I. UNDERSTANDING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM 

A. Different Terms for Similar Actions.  The first step in understanding the 
juvenile justice system and appreciating its close parallel to the adult system 
is to recognize that the vocabulary used in the system is different.  For 
example: 

1. Adults are "arrested," then "jailed" or "imprisoned," while children are 
"detained" and "institutionalized." 

2. Adults commit "crimes," while juveniles commit "offenses‖ that would be 
a crime if committed by an adult." 

3. Adults are "found guilty of a crime," while a minor is "found responsible 
for a delinquent act." 

4. Adults appear in "District" or "Superior Court" before a "judge" or 
"magistrate," while a child appears in "Family Court" before a judge or 
"master." 

5. An adult can be imprisoned for "rehabilitation" and/or "punishment."  In 
the juvenile system, a child cannot, by law, be punished, but is instead 
"treated."  If the child is not amenable to treatment within the juvenile 
correctional system, a judge can "waive" a minor to adult status to allow 
rehabilitation and/or punishment within the adult correctional system (there 
is no adult equivalent to a juvenile waiver). 

  

B. Purpose of Term Differences.  Examples of term differences such as those 
cited above continue, but the purpose remains constant--to get distance 
between the adult criminal system and preserve the unique nature of juvenile 
processing.  However, while there is effort to get this distance, case law has 
furnished the minor with all the protections given an adult in a true criminal 
case.  That distance sought then erodes, and what is left are a few special 
provisions for juveniles in addition to the same process given adults, but using 
different names. 

C. The Concept of "Juvenile Arrest."  Nowhere in the juvenile justice system 
is there more confusion than in the concept of what a "juvenile arrest" is.  
Clarifying that single issue does more to dispel frustrations and confusion 
than any other act.  Towards that clarification, a review and expansion of 
several terms is included below: 

1. Custody.  The general term indicating any restraint of liberty.  The mere 
act of an officer telling a subject "I need to talk to you" implies the subject 
is to stop, and liberty is therefore restrained.  There are, consequently, 
many types of custody: 

a). Protective custody.  Situations where officers restrain the liberty of 
a person to accomplish some form of protection of the individual 
stopped.  These occasions include: 

i. Non-criminal commitments of intoxicated persons (adult or 
juvenile). 

ii. Custody of mentally ill for evaluation (adult or juvenile). 

iii. Custody of runaways (juveniles only). 

iv. Custody of curfew violators (juveniles only). 

v. Custody of abused or neglected children (juveniles only). 

b). Investigative Stops.  The investigative stop and field interview, 
which is a brief restraint of liberty based on a police officer's 
"reasonable suspicion that criminality is afoot." 

c). Infractions.  When a subject violates a law minor enough to have as 
its maximum punishment, if convicted, a fine under $300.00, 
impoundment, or other minor sanction excluding any jail term, an 
officer may take that person into custody only long enough to process 
the violation and charge it on a citation. 

d). Juvenile custody for delinquent acts.  Because this is the exact 
equivalent to an adult arrest, common language erroneously calls this 
a "juvenile arrest."  This is the taking into custody of a minor for a 
violation of a law that would be a crime if committed by an adult. 

2. Arrests.  For juveniles, applies only to violations of crimes found in the 
Traffic code, Fish and Game code, or Parks and Recreation ordinances. 

  

Key Issue:  By definition, an arrest is taking a person into custody to 
answer to an allegation of criminal conduct.  Since criminal conduct is 
behavior which could result in imprisonment, and since statute and Rules 
of Court specifically prohibit punishment or imprisonment of juveniles, it is 
technically impossible to "arrest" a juvenile.  There is, however, an 
exception, and that exception is when the conduct is a crime found in the 
Traffic code, Fish and Game code, or Parks and Recreation code (that is, 
violations of the provisions of AS Title 28, 13 AAC, or AMC Chapter 9).  
Alaska Statute Title 47 (that portion that governs purview of Children's 
Court) specifically states that Children's Court does not have jurisdiction 
when the violation is found in those codes.  Consequently, juvenile 
offenders of those provisions are handled as adults, including offenders of 
criminal acts found in those codes.  The two elements that make juvenile 
arrests different from adults' are: 

a). A legal guardian must appear in court with the minor (though not 
necessarily at bail setting); and 

b). All institutional time would be spent at a juvenile institution.  The 
two primary occasions for this are: 

i. If bail is required at the initial bail hearing, the juvenile would be 
remanded to McLaughlin Youth Center until bail is posted or other 
conditions are met. 

ii. If convicted and sentenced, the juvenile would serve the time at a 
juvenile institution. 

II. ENTRY INTO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM 

A. Two Systems Can be Entered.  A juvenile, therefore, can be subject to two 
systems within the judiciary, namely: 

1. The adult court system, for violations of: 

a). Any law, whether criminal or infraction, if that law falls in the Traffic, 
Fish and Game, or Parks and Recreation codes (City or State version); 
or 

b). Any criminal law if waived to adult status by Family Court, or the 
crime falls under the provisions for automatic waiver to adult status.  
This waiving occurs after police custody, so does not impact officers in 
their field  duties, but would impact where court testimony would occur.  

2. The Family Court System, for any of the following reasons: 

a). Being the victim of certain acts (Child in Need of Aid, or CINA), 
including (AS 47.10.011): 

i. Being habitually absent from home, where the child's 
conduct places the child at substantial risk of physical or 
mental injury. 

  

ii. Refusing to accept available care (the minor is considered 
to be the victim of his or her own act). 

iii. Guardians unwilling or unable to care for the minor, 
including abandonment. 

iv. Guardians unwilling or unable to furnish special medical 
or psychological care. 

v. Guardians commit or omit act(s) which cause substantial 
physical harm or its potential. 

vi. Sexual abuse has been or will be committed due to 
guardians (their acts, lack of supervision, or other 
deficiency). 

vii. Guardians promote delinquency. 

viii. Physical abuse or neglect has been suffered due to the 
guardians. 

-OR- 

b). Being the perpetrator of criminal acts or infractional acts (i.e. 
"delinquent" acts), providing those violations do not fall within the 
Traffic, Fish and Game, or Parks and Recreation Code, or under the 
provisions of the automatic waiver statute (If they do, the adult system 
is entered, as described earlier).

3.02.085  Misdemeanor Citations 

To inform all personnel of when and how to issue a Uniform Summons and 
Complaint to charge certain misdemeanor offenders as an alternative to 
processing that person before a Magistrate. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

That members of the Anchorage Police Department properly use the Uniform 
Summons and Complaint to charge appropriate misdemeanor offenses in lieu of 
a physical appearance before a committing Magistrate when deemed appropriate 
by the arresting officer and permitted by policy. 

DISCUSSION 

When a person is stopped or contacted by a peace officer for the commission of 
a misdemeanor or the violation of a municipal ordinance, the person may, in the 
discretion of the contacting peace officer, be issued a citation instead of being 
taken before a judge or magistrate under AS 12.25.150.  This procedure 
addresses that option, and refers to it as ―issuing a misdemeanor citation.‖   

As such, this procedure begins after the arrest has been affected and/or the 
misdemeanor investigation concluded.  For information on making a 
misdemeanor arrest, consult the procedure entitled ―Arrest and Custody--
Misdemeanors‖ (3.02.025). 

DEFINITIONS 

Uniform Summons and Complaint:  A form used in the field to charge most 
infractions and some misdemeanors.  When used to charge traffic infractions, it 
is referred to as a ―traffic citation.‖  When used to charge certain misdemeanors, 
it is called a ―misdemeanor citation‖ or a ―summons‖. 

II. PURPOSE OF THE MISDEMEANOR CITATION 

PROCEDURE 

  

A. Charge in the Field.  The misdemeanor citation allows officers to complete 
the charging document in the field.  This serves to:  

1. Expedite officers processing of that call.  

2. Relieve the Magistrate of conducting a bail hearing.  

3. Relieve Corrections personnel of having to remand a subject.  

4. Spare violators the time, expense and embarrassment of appearing 
before a committing judicial officer, yet compelling them to take 
responsibility for the violation. 

B. Do Not Charge Unnecessarily.  Simplification of the processing was not 
intended to encourage arrests/charging in situations which would not 
otherwise terminate in an arrest or charging. 

II. CRITERIA FOR ISSUING A MISDEMEANOR CITATION 

A. Standards.  In order for officers to issue a Misdemeanor Citation, certain 
conditions must be met.  These are: 

1. The offense must be a State or Municipal misdemeanor.  

2. The arrestee must be an adult, or a juvenile arrested for a crime found 
in the traffic code (i.e. crimes found in Alaska Statute Title 28, 13 AAC, or 
Municipal Code Chapter 9), Fish and Game code, or Parks and 
Recreation code. 

3. Identification must be positive, either through pictures, identification, 
personal knowledge, or other absolute method.  

4. Officers must have reasonable belief that arrestees are not a danger to 
themselves or others.  

5. The arrestee does not insist on seeing a judge or magistrate.  

6. The arrestee agrees to sign the citation guaranteeing appearance in 
court.  

7. Force was not used to effect the arrest.  

8. A citation shall not be issued if the peace officer has probable cause to 
believe the person committed a crime involving domestic violence; in this 
paragraph, "crime involving domestic violence" has the meaning given in 
AS 18.66.990. 

9. There is no evidence to suggest the arrestee would not appear in court.  
This can be established by investigating the arrestee's:  

a). Marital status and family ties; 

b). Residence history; 

c). Employment history. 

  

B. No Requirement to Issue.  Issuing a misdemeanor citation is an option for 
officers.  Although issuing a misdemeanor citation in eligible misdemeanor 
cases is encouraged, it is not required and a physical arrest can be effected. 

III. APPLICATION OF THE MISDEMEANOR CITATION 

A. Issuing Occasions.  There are two occasions when officers can issue a 
misdemeanor citation, assuming the above conditions are satisfied.  They 
are: 

1. When officers elect to conclude a qualifying misdemeanor investigation 
with the issuance of the citation.  This applies to misdemeanor arrests 
made by officers for an offense committed in their presence, misdemeanor 
arrests made by a private person, or as the final act of a misdemeanor 
investigation.  Notice that the misdemeanor investigation involves no 
arrest, per se, but only filing a charge using the misdemeanor citation as a 
charging document.  

2. If officers take any misdemeanor offender before a magistrate, and that 
magistrate elects to release that person on his own recognizance, officers 
can either:  

a). Let the defendant leave, and prepare a conventional complaint; or  

b). Complete the Uniform Summons and Complaint using the date and 
time set by the magistrate.  If so, officers should write/type boldly on 
the citation ―COURT DATE SET BY MAGISTRATE,‖ and issue the 
citation to the defendant prior to release. 

IV. PROCESSING THE MISDEMEANOR CITATION 

A. Form Completion.  Details on how to properly complete the Uniform 
Summons and a complaint as a misdemeanor citation can be found in the 
Report Writing Manual.  

B. Distribution.  

1. Once completed, the arrestee is given a legible white copy, specifying a 
court date of either: 

a). A date which is either provided by dispatch or it can be obtained 
from the officers MDC.  Court dates are set no less than 30 days out 
from the date of issuance and is dependent on the defendant‘s first 
initial of their last name. 

b). If issued subsequent to a judicial officer‘s release on the 
defendant‘s own recognizance, the date and time specified by that 
judicial officer should be shown, with the bold written notation on the 
citation ―COURT DATE ASSIGNED BY THE MAGISTRATE‖ as 
previously discussed. 

-OR- 

  

2. The second copy and the envelope normally issued with citations do not 
apply and can be disregarded (these are used for mail-in resolution to 
various traffic infractions). 

C. Time of Appearance.  The time for appearance is 9:00 a.m., unless the 
magistrate sets a time-certain during the bail hearing.  This is pre-printed on 
all citations issued by Packetwriter and on all standard APD handwritten 
criminal citations 

D. Disposition.  At the time of issuance, the Uniform Summons and Complaint 
is signed by the officer‘s, including officers DSN.  At the end of the shift, the 
form is submitted to the records section either electronically or in paper form.  
The citation is ultimately forwarded to the Municipal Prosecutor or Traffic 
Court as a charging document.

3.02.090  Protective Custody- Juvenile Abuse/Neglect 

To advise all employees of the procedures regarding juvenile abuse and neglect 
incidents. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

Recognizing that nowhere else in police work is there a more direct impact on the 
preservation of life, abatement of pain, and eventual crime prevention than in the 
enforcement of the child abuse and neglect laws, the Department is dedicated to 
aggressive enforcement of the State and Municipal child protective custody laws. 

DEFINITIONS 

Child Abuse or Neglect:  As defined in AS 47.17.290(2)," means the physical 
injury or neglect, mental injury, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, or 
maltreatment of a child under the age of 18 by a person under circumstances 
that indicate that the child's health or welfare is harmed or threatened thereby." 

Neglect:  As defined in AS 47.17.290 (10) means "the failure by a person 
responsible for the child's welfare to provide necessary food, care, clothing, 
shelter, or medical attention for a child." 

Sexual Exploitation:  As defined in AS 47.17.290 (16) "includes (A) allowing, 
permitting, or encouraging a child to engage in prostitution prohibited by AS 
11.66.100 - 11.66.150, by a person responsible for the child's welfare; (B) 
allowing, permitting, encouraging, or engaging in activity prohibited by AS 
11.41.455(a), [i.e. unlawful exploitation of a minor], by a person responsible for 
the child's welfare. 

REFERENCE 

This procedure is founded on the provisions of Title 47 of the Alaska Statutes 
(the 47.10 series).  Of particular note is: AS 47.10.142 Emergency custody and 
temporary placement hearing.  The Department of Health and Social Services 

  

may take emergency custody of a minor upon discovering any of the following 
circumstances: 

The minor has been abandoned; 

The minor has been grossly neglected by the minor's parents or guardian as 
"neglect" is defined in AS 47.10.014, and the department determines that 
immediate removal from the minor's surroundings is necessary to protect the 
minor's life or provide immediate necessary medical attention; 

The minor has been subjected to child abuse or neglect by a person 
responsible for the minor's welfare, as "child abuse or neglect" is defined in 
AS 47.10.014, and the department determines that immediate removal from 
the minor's surroundings is necessary to protect the minor's life or that 
immediate medical attention is necessary; or 

A child or sibling has been sexually abused under circumstances listed in AS 
47.10.011(7). 

PROCEDURE 

I. POLICE ROLE IN JUVENILE ABUSE AND/OR NEGLECT CASES 

A. Purposes of the Officer's Investigation.  An officer's investigation of an 
abuse/neglect case is to satisfy two purposes, namely: 

1. Secure evidence to possibly substantiate child abuse/neglect to assist 
Division of Health and Social Services in their effort to obtain and maintain 
custody of the child; and 

2. Secure evidence for possible criminal prosecution of the people 
responsible for the abuse/neglect. 

B. Police Have a Modified Role.  Close examination of Title 47 reveals that 
the responsibility and authority to take emergency custody of an 
abused/neglected child is vested in the Division of Health and Social 
Services, and not with the police.  Consequently, the officer's role in an 
abuse/neglect situation is at least slightly different than that of mentally ill 
cases, runaways, or other protective custody calls.  Officers, therefore, can be 
confronted with a controversial situation over which they have little primary 
authority.  The following guide should be used when investigating abuse or 
neglect cases:   

1. Secure the scene and investigate potential allegations of abuse, 
neglect, and/or assault. 

2. Arrests: 

a). If the result of an investigation is an arrest, either physical arrest or 
by warrant, notify the Office of Children‘s Service (OCS) for placement 
of the juvenile(s). 

b). Assist OCS in placing the juvenile(s) (primarily this will be in the 
form of transportation). 

  

c). Leave a Child in Need of Aid Form with the guardian or at the 
residence of the guardian from where the juvenile is being taken. 

3. Non-Arrests: 

a). In cases where an arrest is not made but there is concern regarding 
the living conditions of the juvenile(s), the officer shall complete a 
report, and 

b). contact OCS as they may want the juvenile(s) placed based on 
prior, or ongoing neglect/abuse cases, and 

c). forward a copy of the report to OCS  

4. In cases of abuse/neglect where the situation is so serious where 
serious harm has occurred, or death might occur, the Crimes Against 
Children Unit shall be notified prior to taking any enforcement action. 

C. Detection of Abuse/Neglect Cases.  Officers may get dispatched to a 
scene to investigate an allegation of child abuse/neglect like any other call.  
However, unrelated calls and routine patrol can provide evidence of child 
abuse and neglect which is in "plain" or "open view."  Such evidence 
accidentally discovered by officers is valid evidence, as with any criminal 
case, and it is Department policy (as well as required by law AS 47.17.020) 
for members to be alert for and respond to any such evidence.

(parent) or guardian, remains in any public place or on the premise of any 
establishment within the municipality during curfew hours. 

The owner, operator, or any employee of an establishment commits an 
offense if he or she knowingly allows a minor to remain upon the premise of 
the establishment during curfew hours without the consent of the minor‘s 
parent or guardian. 

EXCEPTIONS 

  

The ordinance provides the following specific exceptions to enforcement.  
Officers contacting minors during curfew hours must ascertain the reason that 
the minor is out and if the reason fits within one of the exception categories. 

A. It is an exception to prosecution under subsections B.1. and B.2. if the 
minor was: 

Accompanied by his or her parent or guardian; 

Involved in an emergency; 

Engaged in an employment activity, or going to or returning from an 
employment activity, without detour or stop; 

On the public right-of-way immediately abutting the minor's residence or 
immediately abutting the residence of a next-door neighbor, if the neighbor 
did not complain to the police department about the minor's presence; 

Attending, or going to or from any lawful activity with the consent of the 
minor's parent or guardian; 

Exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States 
Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech, and 
the right of assembly; or 

Married or had disabilities of minority removed in accordance with AS 
9.55.590. 

B. It is an exception to prosecution under subsection B.2. that the owner, 
operator, or employee of an establishment promptly notified the police 
department that a minor was present on the premises of the establishment 
during curfew hours and refused to leave. 

I. INTRODUCTION 

PROCEDURE 

A. Background.  Curfew laws have historically suffered periodic abuse by 
governments, so have received much attention by appellate courts.  Properly 
framed and enforced, however, such ordinances can operate to: 

1. Protect the minor from a variety of physical and emotional hazards. 

2. Reduce crime. 

II. Enforcement method 

3. Alert authorities to minors who are grossly unsupervised.  

A. Detection.  Detection of curfew violations and approach of the subject(s) is 
indistinguishable from the detection of suspicious circumstances and 
approaching suspicious subjects found in the procedure ―Custody--Field 
Interviews‖.  If an officer has reasonable suspicion that a particular person is 
under age, and the time and location meet the legal requirements for curfew 
violation, that officer is well within his/her authority and duty to approach and 
question that subject.  

  

B. Resolution.  The following are guidelines for the officer in resolving 
possible curfew violations.  Experience has shown that an officer is most 
likely to encounter one of several situations, each of which is discussed 
below. 

1. Age in question. 

a). An essential element of curfew is that the subject is under 17 years 
of age.  Often, a minor will appear young, but claim to be 17 or older. 
Juveniles do not routinely carry identification, so it is up to the officer to 
investigate.  In these situations, consider the following: 

i. The minor's identity is the most important fact to establish, as age 
can be determined later.  There are no ―victims‖ to curfew, so the 
urgency of the investigation is diminished. 

ii. Parental contact will usually resolve questions of age and 
identity. 

2. Curfew violation established, but no parent available. 

a). Ultimate parental notification is mandatory in a curfew violation, but 
immediate contact cannot always be made.  In such an event, the 
officer's investigation can conclude in one of 3 possible ways, namely: 

i. The minor has no parents immediately available, but still has 
access to housing and reasonable care.  If so, the minor can be 
released on his/her own, with parental notification made through 
follow-up investigation with a parent.  If appropriate, the officer may 
issue the juvenile a civil citation at the time of release, advising the 
parent of the citation at a later time.  

ii. The minor has no parents immediately available, but other 
responsible adults are available to care for the juvenile.  If so, the 
minor can be released to such an adult with parental notification 
established through the same third-party.  If appropriate, the officer 
may issue the juvenile a civil citation at the time of release, advising 
the third party of the citation. 

iii. The minor has no parents immediately available, and no place to 
stay or responsible adult to assume custody.  The juvenile can be 
transported to the Covenant House Assessment Center who will 
assume custody of the juvenile and will contact the parent or 
guardian of the juvenile.  The officer may issue the juvenile a civil 
citation at the time of transfer. Covenant House will advise the 
parent of the citation is one was issued.   

Note: It is important to remember that our policy is to detain juveniles only in 
cases where there is a need to protect them from harm or the commission of 
delinquent acts.  Detaining a juvenile should be viewed as a last resort and must 
fall within these criteria. 

C. Parental Notification.  Parents are notified for several reasons, including: 

  

1. To inform them that their child has had police contact, and the nature 
and extent of that contact. 

2. To establish if there was parental permission for the juvenile to be out, 
which is an exception to curfew ordinance. 

3. To answer any questions the parent(s) might have, including resources 
available in the community for family help, or clarification of the curfew 
laws. 

D. Establishments.  An owner, operator, or employee of an establishment 
may be charged under section B.2. of the curfew ordinance for allowing a 
minor to remain on the establishment's premises during curfew hours.  In 
determining whether to charge under this section, the officer should consider 
the totality of the circumstances, including but not limited to: 

1. Any aggravating circumstances which may have raised the seriousness 
of the violation or placed the minor in an unsafe situation; and 

2. The establishment's employee's knowledge that a curfew law was in 
effect at the time; and 

3. The steps that the establishment had taken to determine its clientele 
were 17 years of age or older; and 

4. The efforts that the establishment's employees made to get the minor to 
leave, and their compliance with section B.2.'s requirement to call police if 
a curfew violator was on their premises and refusing to leave. 

E. Charging Documents.  Since the rights of defendants and the requirements 
for processing differ from those in criminal cases, the standard Uniform 
Summons and Complaint cannot be used to charge violators.  The proper 
charging document is the Civil Citation.  

1. Though the Civil Citation form appears substantially similar to the 
Uniform Summons and Complaint, there are some minor differences in 
both structure and processing.  See the Custody – Civil 
Violations/Infractions Policy for further on this document.  

a). Violations of curfew restrictions are civil infractions carrying a fine 
ranging from $75 to a maximum of $300 and do not require an 
appearance unless a hearing is requested by the defendant.  For 
uniform enforcement purposes, officers will assess a standard fine of 
$75 for curfew violations, unless either of the following aggravating 
circumstances exists: 

i. The juvenile has been cited for curfew violation at least once 
prior, and the previous violation(s) can be documented by the 
officer; or 

ii. The juvenile has committed a crime while in violation of the 
curfew. 

  

In the cases cited above, officers should assess the maximum fine 
of $300. Although the law provides for officer discretion, fines other 
than $75 or $300 should not be assessed.  It is incumbent upon 
officers to thoroughly articulate the reason(s) why a juvenile was 
fined the maximum amount on the reverse side of the officer's copy 
of the citation, or on a Police Report.  Officers are encouraged to 
aggressively enforce the curfew law as a deterrent, especially in 
conjunction with arrests for "Minor Consuming Alcohol." 

2. Issuance of a civil citation for a curfew violation does not require a 
police report unless the circumstances are such that the situation cannot 
be fully explained on the ticket form, or if the citation is part of a larger 
investigation involving the possibility of criminal charges, such as child 
abuse or neglect.  In those cases, the case number must be entered in the 
marked spaces along the right margin.  

3. Violations of civil infractions do not require court appearances by either 
adults or minors.  However, if a hearing is requested by the defendant, 
such hearing will be held before the Municipal Administrative Hearings 
Officer.

3.02.100  Protective Custody--Non-Criminal Commitment 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

REFERENCES 

To advise all personnel of the laws and procedures affecting non-criminal 
commitments of all age groups. 

It is the policy of the Anchorage Police Department to employ any legal resource 
to protect its citizenry, including the non-criminal commitment of persons so 
debilitated by alcohol that they cannot care for themselves. 

The foundation for non-criminal commitments appears in Alaska Statute 
47.37.170, which reads: 

"Treatment and services for intoxicated persons and persons incapacitated by 
alcohol. 

(a). An intoxicated person may come voluntarily to an approved public treatment 
facility for emergency treatment.  A person who appears to be intoxicated in a 
public place and to be in need of help or a person who appears to be intoxicated 
in or upon a licensed premise where intoxicating liquors are sold or consumed 
who refuses to leave upon being requested to leave by the owner, an employee 
or a peace office(r) [sic] may be taken into protective custody and assisted by a 
peace officer or member of the emergency service patrol to the person's home, 
an approved public treatment facility, an approved private treatment facility, or  
another appropriate health facility.  If all of the preceding facilities, including the 
person's home, are determined to be unavailable, a person taken into protective 
custody and assisted under this subsection may be taken to a state or municipal 
detention facility in the area. 

(b). A person who appears to be incapacitated by alcohol in a public place shall 
be taken into protective custody by a peace officer or a member of the 

  

emergency service patrol and immediately brought to an approved public 
treatment facility, an approved private treatment facility, or another appropriate 
health facility of service for emergency medical treatment.  If no treatment facility 
or emergency medical service is available, a person who appears to be 
incapacitated by alcohol in a public place shall be taken to a state or municipal 
detention facility in the area, if that appears necessary for the protection of the 
person's health or safety. 

(d). A person who, after medical attention at an appropriate health facility, is 
found to be incapacitated by alcohol or drugs at the time of admission or to have 
become incapacitated by alcohol or drugs at any time after admission, may not 
be detained at a facility after the person is no longer incapacitated by alcohol.  A 
person may not be detained at a facility if the person remains incapacitated by 
alcohol for more than 48 hours after admission as a patient, unless the person is 
committed under AS 47.37.180" 

I. TAKING PROTECTIVE CUSTODY 

PROCEDURES 

A. Conditions Required to Take Custody.  AS 47.37.170 provides that anyone 
meeting one of the following conditions can be subject to protective custody, 
even if against that person's will: 

1. Appears intoxicated in a public place and in need of help; or 

2. Appears intoxicated in/upon a premise licensed for sale or consumption 
of alcohol and refuses to leave when so instructed by the owner or 
employee, or by a peace officer; or 

3. Appears incapacitated by alcohol or drugs in a public place (not just 
intoxicated). 

B. Age and Gender Sex Applicability.  No distinction is made as to age or sex. 
Consequently, juveniles and adults, of either sex, are subject to the provisions 
of this law.  The only difference is with regard to age: juveniles in emergency 
protective custody shall not be placed in a jail or secured facility. 

C. Establishing Incapacitation.  As the statute states, one condition allowing 
protective custody to be effected is when a person is "incapacitated" in a 
public place.  To establish incapacitation, the officer must consider such 
elements as: 

1. Location--Is help and/or shelter close by?  Is a unique danger present 
(railroad activity; vehicular traffic; open water)? 

2. Weather--Recall the cause and symptoms of hypothermia. (See also 
"Cold Alert"). 

3. Company--Is a competent friend/relative with the person to help? 

D. Taking Protective Custody.  If officers determine that protective custody is 
appropriate, they shall adhere to policies and procedures for effecting and 
maintaining custody.  Although not an arrest, protective searches, restraint 

  

considerations, transport procedures, and other such issues should be made.  
A review of the procedures addressing in-custody transports could assist 
officers.  

E. Disposition.  AS 47.37.170 mandates a prioritized order of destinations for 
a person taken into protective custody.  That order is: 

1. Home, if officers can determine where that is. 

2. Approved public treatment facility, which can include a hospital for 
immediate medical attention. 

3. Approved private treatment facility or health care facility, such as a 
facility on contract with the State, or a private facility at which the subject 
is a patient, if that information can be determined. 

4. State or Municipal detention facility if none of the previously mentioned 
facilities are available. 

F. Field Report.  Division of Corrections maintains a special Non-criminal 
Commitment Remand Form which officers must complete at the booking 
facility.  Officers may simply fill out the non-criminal remand form and turn it in 
with all other reports at the end of shift.  The event needs no further 
documentation in the form of a Police Report unless extenuating 
circumstances, such as force being used by the officer to overcome 
resistance at a soft empty hand control level or higher, dictate the need for a 
more detailed explanation. 

II. JUVENILES 

A. Special Considerations.  Juveniles are also afforded the protection given in 
a non-criminal commitment, but two items must be adhered to by officers: 

1. Prior to commitment, a juvenile must get a medical clearance.  
Therefore, officers must transport, or cause such transport of the juvenile, 
to a hospital. 

2. If the juvenile is cooperative and no guardian, family member, or 
responsible adult can be located, the juvenile shall be transported to

3.02.105  Protective Custody--Persons with a Mental Illness 

To inform all personnel of the laws, rules, and policies governing the handling of 
a call for service that involves a person with a mental illness.   

Actions taken by Department members during encounters with a person with a 
mental illness must be guided by a balance between protecting that person, 
safeguarding the community, and avoiding personal injury. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

Nearly any call can involve a person with a mental illness, but officers often 
recognize that the degree of mental illness is mild enough to warrant handling the 
case conventionally--even including arresting that person despite the illness.  
The officer might conclude, however, that a particular subject is so disturbed as 
to necessitate taking protective custody, in lieu of criminal custody, because of 
the illness.  How that is done is the subject of this procedure. 

DEFINITIONS 

Designated Mental Health Professional includes a psychiatrist or physician who 
is licensed to practice in this state or employed by the federal government or a 
clinical psychologist licensed by the state Board of Psychologist and Psychologist 
Associate Examiners. 

Gravely Disabled means a condition in which a person as a result of mental 
illness:  

(A) is in danger of physical harm arising from such complete neglect of basic 
needs for food, clothing, shelter, or personal safety as to render serious 
accident, illness, or death highly probable if care by another is not taken; or  

(B) will, if not treated, suffer or continue to suffer severe and abnormal 
mental, emotional, or physical distress, and this distress is associated with 

  

significant impairment of judgment, reason, or behavior causing a substantial 
deterioration of the person‘s previous ability to function independently. 

Likely to Cause Serious Harm means a person who:  

(A) Poses a substantial risk of bodily harm to that person‘s self, as manifested 
by recent behavior causing, attempting, or threatening that harm;  

(B) Poses a substantial risk of harm to others as manifested by recent 
behavior causing, attempting, or threatening harm, and is likely in the near 
future to cause physical injury, physical abuse, or substantial property 
damage to another person; or 

(C) Manifests a current intent to carry out plans of serious harm to that 
person‘s self or another. 

Mental Illness means an organic, mental, or emotional impairment that has 
substantial adverse effects on an individual‘s ability to exercise conscious control 
of the individual‘s actions or ability to perceive reality or to reason or understand; 
mental retardation, epilepsy, drug addiction, and alcoholism do not per se 
constitute mental illness, although persons suffering from these conditions may 
also be suffering from mental illness. 

Peace Officer includes an officer of the state troopers, a member of the police 
force of a municipality, a village public safety officer, a regional public safety 
officer, a United States marshal or deputy marshal, and an officer whose duty it is 
to enforce and preserve the public peace.

PROCEDURE 

I. PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO TAKE CUSTODY 

Alaska State Law (AS 47.30.705) allows certain professionals to take a person 
with a mental illness into custody so as to deliver the individual to the nearest 
evaluation facility.  The peace officer or mental health professional shall complete 
an application for examination of the person in custody and be interviewed by a 
mental health professional at the facility (e.g. Providence Hospital Psychiatric 
Emergency Room herein referred to as P.P.E.R.).  Those designated 
professionals include a psychiatrist or physician who is licensed to practice in this 
state or employed by the federal government, or a clinical psychologist licensed 
by the state Board of Psychologist and Psychological Associate Examiners, and 
peace officers who have probable cause to believe that a person is gravely 
disabled or is suffering from mental illness and is likely to cause serious harm to 
self or others of such immediate nature that such considerations of safety do not 
allow initiation of involuntary commitment procedures set out in AS 47.30.700.  

II. STANDARDS TO BE MET TO TAKE CUSTODY 

A. Voluntary Admissions 

  

1. If an adult (18 years or older), the Department will provide courtesy 
transportation only.  At a minimum, the transporting officer shall contact 
the facility intake staff to provide background information on the subject.  

2. If a juvenile (0 to 17 years old), a parent/guardian is required to consent 
to the juvenile‘s admission, so it is advisable to have the custodian 
accompany, follow, or meet you at Providence Hospital (either Admissions 
or P.P.E.R.) or North Star Hospital, whichever is the parent‘s preference.  
The parent/guardian can assist in expediting the process by calling ahead 
to the hospital and then arriving at the hospital as soon as possible.  Until 
the parent/guardian arrives at North Star Hospital, the officer must remain 
with the juvenile.  It is the consent of the parent/guardian that is key, not 
the consent (or lack of consent) by the juvenile.  Children aged 12 or 
younger are not usually admitted to Providence Hospital for mental health 
treatment because the hospital does not have a children‘s inpatient unit.   

If the parent/guardian is not willing to voluntarily admit the child to North 
Star or Providence Hospital and the officer has probable cause to take 
protective custody of the juvenile based on Title 47 standards, see Final 
Destinations for guidance. 

B. Involuntary admissions are possible if peace officers (or designated 
professionals) have probable cause to believe the person is either: 

1. Gravely disabled (see definition). 

-OR- 

2. If suffering from mental illness and is likely to cause serious harm to self 
or others (see definition) of such immediate nature that considerations of 
safety do not allow initiation of involuntary commitment procedures set out 
in AS 47.30.700‖ (i.e. an ―Ex-parte/Judicial Commitment Order‖ would be 
too slow under the circumstances). 

C. Ex-parte Orders.  On rare occasions, officers will be furnished with a 
written ex-parte commitment order from a judge, and are thereby obligated to 
take the named subject (age 13 and older) into custody and transport him/her, 
involuntarily, to API for a mental health evaluation.  API refers to these as 
―Evaluation and Screening Orders.‖  

Usually the Judicial Services division of the Alaska State Troopers handles 
the service of these orders.  However, in the unlikely event an officer with the 
Department is requested to serve an ex-parte order, be aware that if the 
subject is in need of medical attention or is under the influence of drugs, other 
substances, or alcohol (more than .100 BAC per API policy), the subject will 
need a medical clearance before A.P.I will accept them (see Medical 
Clearances for guidance). 

D. A Licensed Physician, Clinical Psychologist, or Psychiatrist can also admit 
a person to a treatment facility.  They do so by completing the ―Peace 
Officer/Mental Health Professional Application for Examination,‖ also know as 

  

the P.O.A.  Officers will on occasion, also be requested to complete a P.O.A. 
when delivering a person to a treatment facility.   

III. TRANSPORT CONSIDERATIONS 

A. Medications.  If the individual is taking medications, the officer should 
transport the medications with the subject in order to transfer the medications 
to the facility staff at the final destination.  

B. Officer Safety.  Officer safety dictates that there is no distinction between 
transporting the person with a mental illness for commitment and transporting 
a prisoner to a jail or correctional facility. (See In-Custody Transport 
procedure 3.02.060)  

C. Soft Restraints. In restraining a person with a mental illness, the 
Anchorage Fire Department and/or Trans-Care (which is dispatched through 
the AFD) can provide assistance with soft restraints (e.g. padded cuffs) and 
strapping the person to a gurney, if necessary for transport.  Both may also 
assist with subjects who are wheelchair-bound.  

D. Inter-Agency Transports.  Occasionally, officers will be called to transport a 
person with a mental illness from one agency to another.  It is not policy to 
routinely provide this service.  However, if the patient is violent, or if other 
circumstances exist that require police services, officers may assist or provide 
such transport.  Trans-Care is typically the agency used to transport non-
violent persons between treatment facilities.  

IV. COMMUNICATIONS 

Officers shall advise dispatch of their custody/transport status, thereby allowing 
dispatch to contact the treatment facility of your incoming admission and any 
special instructions you may wish to convey (e.g. need for a wheelchair, 
combative subject, injuries to subject, need for security staff assistance, etc.). 

V. MEDICAL CLEARANCES 

Officers should be alert to any injuries or medical problems the subject might 
have, and ensure those problems are addressed prior to any commitment 
activities.  Medical clearances are occasionally done by the AFD paramedics at 
the scene, but actual attention in a hospital setting is more frequently the 
appropriate choice of action.  If the subject is in need of medical attention or is 
under the influence of drugs, other substances, or alcohol (.100 BAC per API 
policy and .150 BAC per Providence Hospital policy), they will need to be 
medically cleared. 

Providence Hospital is the ideal location for individuals to be medically cleared 
because they have a locked facility with a 23 hour hold capability.  Entry into the 
medical emergency room is made through the ambulance bay on the north side 
of the building.  There are two exceptions an officer should be aware of:  

A. Persons (of any age) who are eligible for treatment at the Alaska Native 
Medical Center (herein referred to as A.N.M.C.) can choose whether they 
receive mental and/or medical health services at A.N.M.C., Providence 

  

Hospital, or Alaska Regional emergency rooms.  At A.N.M.C., eligible patients 
will receive free care but will be billed for any services rendered at another 
facility. Ask the person where they choose to be medically cleared and then 
transport them there. 

B. If any adult is demanding treatment at a particular appropriate facility, 
transport the person to that facility.   

In the event the individual will need to remain at the medical emergency room 
for an extended period of time, hospital security staff may be requested to 
assist so the officer may return to other duties (see Final Destinations for 
continued guidance). 

VI. FINAL DESTINATIONS 

A. Treatment Facilities 

1. All adult persons (18 years or older) with a mental illness taken into 
protective custody for an evaluation (involuntary admissions) ultimately go 
to the Providence Psychiatric Emergency Room.  An officer that has taken 
protective custody of an adult will transport them to P.P.E.R. and complete 
the ―Providence Psychiatric Emergency Department - Anchorage Police 
Department/Alaska State Troopers Patient Information Log‖ and deliver it 
to staff.  This is a request for the psychiatric evaluation of the person by a 
designated professional.  Determining the level of psychiatric intervention 
a person will receive is in the discretion of the evaluating P.P.E.R. staff.  If 
requested to do so by P.P.E.R. staff, the officer shall also complete the 
―Peace Officer/Mental Health Professional Application for Examination.‖ 
There are two exceptions regarding when an officer will not bring the 
person to P.P.E.R. for treatment.  

a). Persons (of any age) who are eligible for treatment at the Alaska 
Native Medical Center can choose whether they receive mental and/or 
medical health services at A.N.M.C., Providence Hospital, or Alaska 
Regional emergency rooms.  At A.N.M.C., eligible persons receive free 
counseling and medical treatment but will be billed for any services 
rendered at another facility.  Ask the person where they choose to be 
treated and then transport the person to that facility.  Inform the facility 
staff of your observations, concerns, and any background information 
surrounding your contact with the person by completing the ―Patient 
Information Log‖ and leaving it with the facility staff.  A phone call by 
the officer to the P.P.E.R. staff (261-2800) is appropriate so as to make 
sure the subject is mentally evaluated prior to release. 

b). If any adult is demanding treatment at a particular appropriate 
facility, transport the person to that facility and inform the facility staff of 
your observations, concerns, and any background information 
surrounding your contact with the person by completing the ―Patient 
Information Log‖ and leaving it with the medical emergency room staff.  
A phone call by the officer to the P.P.E.R. staff (261-2800) is 

  

appropriate so as to make sure the subject is mentally evaluated prior 
to release.  This will be a rare circumstance where an individual is only 
willing to receive the necessary mental health care at a facility other 
than P.P.E.R.   

2. An officer who has taken involuntary protective custody of a juvenile (0 
to 17 years old) under Title 47 requirements has to take into consideration 
some special circumstances that will affect the final destination of the 
juvenile. 

a). Officers are encouraged to gain consent from the parent / guardian 
of the juvenile.  If consent is given, then proceed with the procedures 
for voluntary admissions.   

b). If the parent / guardian of the juvenile refuses to give consent or the 
officer is unable locate them and the officer has probable cause under 
Title 47 requirements to take protective custody of the juvenile, 
transport him or her to P.P.E.R. for an evaluation. P.P.E.R staff will 
involve Office of Children‘s Services regarding further care of the 
juvenile. 

If you have any questions as to where to transport an individual, you 
can contact North Star, A.P.I., Providence Hospital, A.N.M.C, or Alaska 
Regional Hospital directly for guidance. 

B. Correctional Facilities.  State law allows a person with a mental illness to 
go to a jail or other correctional facility in lieu of a treatment facility providing 
the following conditions are satisfied: 

1. That such placement is:  

a). For protective custody purposes and  

b). only while awaiting transportation to a treatment facility. 

2. The subject has been arrested for a criminal offense, and none of the 
provisions for emergency commitment are invoked (that is, not a 
protective custody commitment).  The officer shall notify correctional staff 
regarding the subject‘s mental condition or impairment. 

VII CONCLUDING THE CALL 

A. Admitting Officer's Duties.  Once at the final destination, the admitting 
officer shall: 

1. Comply with current agency rules regarding the securing of weapons at 
their facility (the staff will advise). 

2. Verbally brief the agency staff of the conditions surrounding your 
request for psychiatric evaluation. 

3. Complete the ―Providence Psychiatric Emergency Department Patient 
Information Log,‖ and if requested, the ―Peace Officer/Mental Health 

-OR- 

  

Professional Application for Examination,‖ and submit both forms to the 
agency staff. 

4. Turn over any personal property or medications belonging to the subject 
to the staff, retaining any weapons to be secured for safekeeping with the 
Property and Evidence section of the Department.  

B. Complete the appropriate police report(s) and if used, attach a copy of the 
―Providence Psychiatric Emergency Department Patient Information Log‖ and 
the ―Peace Officer/Mental Health Professional Application for Examination‖ 
forms to the report.  Officers are required to complete a police report at the 
conclusion of a call for service when: 

1. The officer admits the person to a treatment facility, whether voluntarily 
or involuntarily, or  

2. The person has made threats of harm to themselves or others, 
regardless of whether the officer takes the person into custody.

3.03.000  Traffic/Towing Impounds 

3.03.005  Towing Public Assists 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DEFINITIONS 

To identify those towing situations which are to assist a motorist (as contrasted 
with impounding for police purposes), and instruct members on how to 
accomplish such a towing. 

No preference towing services be rendered by members of the Department to 
citizens in need of towing equipment, and that such assistance be given in lieu of 
impoundment whenever practical.   

No Preference Towing:  Summoning a tow contractor on behalf of a citizen.  This 
is contrasted with an "impound" in that a no preference tow is not for police 
purposes, and the property is not taken into police custody. 

Officer:  For purposes of this procedure, the term "officer" applies to both sworn 
officers of the Department, and Community Services Officers (CSO).  A CSO 
may perform all the duties of a sworn officer with regards to towing.  

I. GENERAL INFORMATION 

PROCEDURE 

A. A no preference tow is for the owner/operator, and does not include any 
type of police custody of the vehicle, while an impoundment is a towing for 
some police purpose. 

B. An Impound Report is not required for a no preference tow. 

C. The APD Rotational Program may be used for no preference tow services 
or any other tow operator that the citizen may request. 

  

II. Guidelines.  If it is determined that towing other than an impoundment is 
required, officers may inform the parties of the services that can be provided as a 
no preference.  These include: 

A. No police intervention.  Some members of the public prefer no police 
involvement.  If the parties have control of the situation, no laws are violated, 
and interest is expressed in handling the problem alone, officers may honor 
that request. 

B. Communications.  The owner/operator may be able to arrange removal of 
the vehicle within a reasonable period of time by contacting private parties. 

C. Summoning a Tow Operator.  If removal of property must be done, and it 
can be accomplished without impoundment, officers will assist the 
owner/operator in coordinating that removal.  In this event, officers will clearly 
advise Dispatch that the summoning of towing equipment is a no preference 
and not an impound.  For such a preference, the following applies: 

1. Government and certain fleet vehicles.  All government vehicles, taxis, 
and most major fleet vehicles maintain their own towing equipment.  All 
reasonable effort will be made to use that equipment when possible. 

2. Accident scene.  When removal of a disabled vehicle is required, the 
operator (if able) will be given the opportunity to select a towing company 
of his/her choice.  If the owner expresses no preference, or is not present 
or able, or if the preferred company cannot respond in reasonable time, 
then the Department may use the APD Rotational Program. 

a). As a reminder--if the owner/operator is unwilling to remove the 
vehicle, or insists on a towing company who cannot respond in 
reasonable time, or is unable to make independent arrangements for 
his/her  property (due to injury, emotional state, etc), then officers must 
tow the vehicle for safekeeping, on behalf of the owner, as an 
impound. 

3. Civil Standbys.  When officers summon tow contractors on behalf of a 
citizen, their role may include a civil standby to resolve possible disputes 
between the owner/operator and the tow contractor for cancelled services, 
method of payment, and the like. 

A. Disposition Code.  Normally, a no preference tow can be "cleared," thereby 
precluding a field report.   

B. No Impound Report is required.  Since the towing is for the owner, and not 
for police purposes, an Impound Report is not appropriate. 

A. Definition.  A no preference tow is similar to calling a cab for a stranded 
person or notifying a victim's spouse to come to that person's aid, while an 
impound is a tow for police purposes, such as impoundment for evidence, 

III. Field Report 

IV. Summary 

  

DUI, or as a result of safety considerations.  Officers will occasionally be 
faced with impounding property for safekeeping even against the owner's will, 
or when the owner is incapable or unwilling to take responsibility for removal 
of his/her property.  In those cases where the owner/operator is available, and 
both willing and able to remove and protect his/her property, officers are able 
to de-escalate the situation from an impound to offering assistance in 
effecting the removal in the form of a public assist.

3.03.010  Towing--Vehicle Impounds 

To advise all personnel of the laws and procedures governing impoundment of 
vehicles by Department employees through a tow operator. 

The authority to impound shall be summoned only to satisfy a State statute or 
Municipal ordinance to include:  Driving Under the Influence (DUI); driving while 
licensed canceled, revoked or suspended; soliciting prostitution; evidence; 
safekeeping or junk/ abandoned vehicles.   

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DEFINITIONS 

Impound:  Any motor vehicle or item, that is collected, found, recovered, seized, 
transferred, or otherwise comes into the custody of the Anchorage Police 
Department, and retained for any criminal or internal investigation, judicial, quasi-
judicial, or adjudicatory proceedings.  Only a contracted tow company shall tow 
said vehicles at the request of a member of the Department. 

Item:  For the purposes of this policy, any non-motorized vehicle to include, but 
not limited to, aircraft, camper shell, household appliances, safes, slide-in 
camper, motor vehicle utility boxes, trailers, watercraft, vehicle frames, vehicle 
parts or other property which requires towing. 

Officer:  For purposes of this policy, the term ―officer‖ applies to sworn officers 
and Community Service Officers (CSOs).  Within this procedure, both can 
execute all the provisions cited, except that CSOs cannot seize or process 
evidence. 

Vehicle:  For purposes of this policy, any motorized unit designed for the 
transport of people, or trailers.    

I. GENERAL INFORMATION 

PROCEDURE 

  

A. The Purpose of Impoundment.  There are eight (8) purposes for 
impounding a vehicle: 

1. Driving Under the Influence (DUI) 

2. Driving with License Cancelled / Revoked / Suspended (DWLC/R/S) 

3. Driving Without Insurance (DWOI) 

4. Solicitation (SOL) 

5. Evidence 

6. Safekeeping 

7. Junk/Abandoned 

8. Scofflaw  

B. Five Criteria Following an Impound: 

1. The vehicle must be towed by the towing contractor currently under 
contract to the Municipality of Anchorage and APD. 

2. All keys belonging to the vehicle must remain inside the vehicle. 

3. Personal property or dangerous items which are in plain view, and/or 
inside unlocked compartments that can be reasonably used to store 
valuable property, must be documented on the impound report form. 

4. In addition, document any significant interior or exterior damage to the 
vehicle prior to the impound. 

5. The Notice of Intent to Impound or Forfeit Vehicle form must be 
completed and the goldenrod copy provided to the defendant when the 
vehicle is being impounded for DUI, DWLC/R/S, DWOI, and SOL. 

II. UNAUTHORIZED REASONS FOR IMPOUNDS.  Officers are reminded that 
valid impounds can provide a valuable service and protection when conducted 
within the parameters described above.  Impounds for the following reason are 
not authorized: 

A. Punitive action against the owner/operator is never authorized. 

III. AUTHORIZED REASONS FOR IMPOUNDS 

A. Driving Under the Influence (DUI).  In accordance with AMC 9.28, the 
arresting officer shall impound the vehicle which was involved in the violation, 
pursuant to AMC 9.28.026. 

B. Driving with a cancelled, revoked or suspended license.  In accordance 
with AMC 9.28.019 and AMC 9.28.030, the arresting officer may impound the 
vehicle which was involved in the violation, pursuant to AMC 9.28.026. 

C. Driving Without Insurance.  In accordance with AMC 9.28.030, the 
arresting officer may impound the vehicle which was involved in the violation 
pursuant to AMC 9.28.026. 

  

D. Soliciting Prostitution.  In accordance with AMC 8.65.030, the arresting 
officer may impound the vehicle which was involved in the violation, pursuant 
to AMC 9.28.026. 

E. Evidence.  To seize property as evidence.  

1. Evidence vehicles and evidence items shall be transported by the tow 
operator contracted with the Municipality and APD.   

2. If the vehicle identification number (VIN) has been removed, replaced, 
or altered, the vehicle will be impounded for evidence. 

3. If processing at the scene cannot be accomplished, and/or the contents 
are to be searched through a warrant, the vehicle may be impounded for 
evidence. Once impounded, officers assume the following responsibilities: 

a). Officers conducting follow-up investigations assume responsibility 
for keeping impound officers apprised of the status of the subject 
vehicle. Once processed for evidence, or once the vehicle looses its 
evidentiary status, the vehicle cannot be kept at the evidence facility. 

F. Safekeeping.  To protect property. 

1. The APD Rotational Program will be used for all safekeep impounds. 

2. Safekeep impounds will apply under the following conditions:  

a). If a vehicle cannot be both legally parked and sufficiently secured at 
the scene; or 

i. If the owner arrives and his/her vehicle has not been attached to 
the tow truck, the owner or designee shall be allowed to remove 
their vehicle. 

ii. If the owner, or designee, arrives and his/her vehicle has been 
attached to the tow truck, the matter becomes a civil problem 
between the tow truck company and the owner/designee. 

b). If an arrestee is unwilling/unable to make alternative arrangements 
for the vehicle; or  

c). If there is other property which cannot be retained by the arrestee 
or adequately protected at the scene; or 

d). if the arrestee requests a police impound for safekeeping. 

3. Subsequent to an accident, under the following conditions:  

a). If a vehicle cannot be both legally parked and sufficiently secured at 
the scene; or  

b). If the operator is unwilling/unable to take custody of that vehicle; or  

c). If there is other property (such as a trailer or boat which cannot be 
sufficiently protected at the scene, or which the owner requests be 
impounded for safekeeping, or which the owner is unwilling/unable to 
take custody of at the scene).  

  

4. Recovered stolen vehicles.  

a). When the owner cannot be contacted. 

b). When the owner can be contacted and requests an impound for 
safekeeping.  

c). When the owner cannot or will not respond in a reasonable amount 
of time.  

5. Stalled vehicles which are vulnerable to theft, vandalism, or other loss if 
not protected.  

6. If the registered owner cannot be verified, or suspicious circumstances 
warrant additional investigation, the vehicle will be impounded for

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil

of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against

3.03.015  Traffic Law Enforcement 

To advise all personnel of the Department‘s policies and procedures for enforcing 
moving and parking violations. 

That members of the Department enforce the traffic code by actively identifying 
violators, conducting traffic stops in a manner balancing officer safety with 
courtesy, and disposing of violations using approved guidelines to ensure 
consistency and fairness. 

Because officers spend so much time on the road, traffic law enforcement 
comprises much of their daily activity, and touches both a larger number and a 
wider variety of citizens than any other police endeavor.  Even if being visible is 
an officer‘s only traffic enforcement activity, he or she would affect more people 
than any aggressive criminal law enforcement effort could.  Coupling this with the 
potential loss of property and life, emotional and physical pain, and all the 
inconveniences of accidents and disrupted traffic flow, the impact of traffic law 
enforcement becomes quite apparent. 

A community imposes traffic and parking regulations on itself as much to ensure 
the convenience of smooth flowing traffic as to protect the safety of its citizenry.  
Like any other body of law, adherence is gained both through voluntary 
compliance, which is most desirable, and forced compliance, under threat of fine, 
imprisonment, impoundment of vehicle, license action, or other sanction. 

While an officer cannot be expected to observe or to take action on all traffic 
violations, failing to actively enforce the code breeds disrespect for the law.  This, 
in turn, undermines the voluntary compliance so important to any law 
enforcement activity.  Indeed, respect for the traffic laws is the single most 
important ingredient in maintaining a safe and orderly flow of traffic, as it is the 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

  

only motivation for drivers to ―do their duty‖ when the police are out of view.  An 
aggressive traffic law enforcement policy, therefore, achieves the following: 

Enhances voluntary compliance, as drivers expect to be held accountable for 
violations, and more readily comply with rules when satisfied others are being 
held accountable, too.  

Develops lawful (and, therefore, safe) driving habits from reflex. 

Enhances public safety, since accidents are reduced both in rate and severity. 

Enhances public service, as traffic flows more smoothly and parking frustrations 
are diminished. 

Clearly, the best traffic law enforcement policy is one which assumes 
enforcement by officers when a violations are observed, but also allows officers 
to consider authorized and consistent mitigations in deciding the best 
enforcement mode (warn, instruct, cite, arrest or disregard). 

DEFINITIONS 

Traffic Law Enforcement (TLE):  A category within the broad topic of ―traffic‖ 
relating to the enforcement of all statutes and ordinances regulating traffic, as 
opposed to the other category of traffic known as ―Traffic Accident Investigation.‖  
Although TLE encompasses many areas, this procedure limits itself to 
enforcement of moving and parking ordinances. 

I. GENERAL INFORMATION 

PROCEDURE 

A. Types of Violations.  Traffic Law Enforcement addresses several 
categories of laws.  Most common of these are: 

1. Parking Violations. 

2. Moving Violations. 

3. Taxicab Violations. 

4. Commercial Vehicle Violations. 

5. Licensing/Registration Violations. 

 6. Certain criminal violations involving vehicles, found in the traffic codes 
instead of the criminal codes (Leaving the Scene of an Accident, Driving 
While Intoxicated, Driving on a Suspended License, to name a few). 

B. Traffic Code Source.  The term ―traffic code‖ refers to the laws contained in 
the following sources: 

1. Anchorage Municipal Code, Titles 9 and 11. 

2. Alaska Statute (AS) Title 28  

3. 13 AAC (Alaska Administrative Code). 

  

C. Range of Seriousness.  The traffic codes have within them violations 
ranging in severity from civil sanctions through felony criminal offenses. 

D. Disposition Alternatives.  When observing any traffic violation, officers can 
react in one or more of the following ways: 

1. Stop violators to instruct them on the applicable traffic law.  

2.  Stop violators to warn them of the violation and possible 
consequences.  

3. Stop violators and issue the appropriate charging document.  

4. If applicable, arrest violators.  

5. Disregard the violation, providing certain standards, discussed next, are 
met. 

E. Criteria for Selecting Appropriate Disposition.  Within the arena of traffic 
law enforcement, the Department is dedicated to a single goal--Quality. 
Officers exercising a professional judgment in discharging their enforcement 
duties is fundamental to achieving that quality. Curiously, Departmental 
expectations of its officers merely reflect the citizen‘s expectations--firm but 
fair treatment, with accuracy of facts and consistency in criteria for disposing 
of violations.  Towards that end, the following guidelines are provided, and 
officers who deviate from these standards must be prepared to articulate the 
reason(s): 

1. The basic premise is that an observed violation warrants a stop, and 
that the traffic stop is for the purpose of charging the violator.  In practice, 
however, issues come to officers' attention that persuade them not to 
make a particular stop or issue a specific citation.  This is not intrinsically 
wrong--indeed, it is often the best choice.  However, if the officer elects to 
take no action on an observed violation, or decides to stop the violator but 
give only a warning or instruction instead of a citation, he/she must base 
that decision on valid, fair, and articulable reasons, and those reasons 
must be reasonably consistent throughout the Department.  For the 
individual officer to retain the discretionary powers needed for effective 
traffic law enforcement, one must rely on professional judgment coupled 
with Department guidelines.  Those guidelines are:   

a). Always consider the objectives of traffic law enforcement when 
deciding on what action to take.  Maintaining the smooth flow of traffic, 
enhancing safety, and instilling respect/voluntary compliance with the 
law are the primary purposes.  So, given a particular situation, how is 
that best achieved?  For instance, officers might best take no action on 
an observed violation if:  

i. Reaching and/or stopping the violator might create more of a 
traffic hazard, or be more disruptive to the smooth flow of traffic, 
than the violation itself.  

  

ii. Officers are engaged in more urgent police activity than the 
observed violation.  

iii. The subject vehicle or violator is suspect in a more substantial 
case, and stopping that vehicle/person would imperil that 
investigation.  

b). Always consider the totality of the circumstances.  There are many 
factors to weigh in deciding whether or not to stop and/or charge a 
violator, and no two elements have equal significance.  Some of these 
factors are: 

i. The seriousness of the offense, which can be influenced by: 

(1). Time of day (lighting, traffic density).  

(2). Causing a near accident. 

(3). Prior warnings to the operator. 

ii. Driver experience. 

(1). Young or newly-licensed drivers can often benefit from 
instruction. 

(2). Nonresident drivers unfamiliar with Anchorage. 

iii. The forum for debate is traffic court and not the street.  Nothing 
should stop officers from assessing genuinely new 
information/evidence in considering the disposition of a violation, 
but irresolvable issues such as an interpretation of the law, the 
value of a particular ordinance, or factual debates, should be 
minimized in the field and adjudicated in traffic court. 

iv. Other circumstances exist which can legitimately convince an 
officer that formal charging may not be in order.  A driver who pulls 
into a no parking zone because of illness, or an undercover officer 
making a minor infraction while following a suspect vehicle are two 
of many examples of unique circumstances requiring a tailored 
response by officers. 

2. Certain offenses have been identified as requiring priority enforcement 
by the Department.  These violations are noteworthy, in that they not only 
cause the most accidents, but tend to be committed by habitual traffic 
offenders.  To reduce accidents and aid the Department of Motor Vehicles 
in the identification of habitual offenders, it is firm Department policy to 
charge all offenders of the following ordinances, unless a compelling 
mitigation is detected and articulated by officers: 

a). All criminal traffic violations, which are: 

i. Leaving the Scene (injury or property damage over $1,000).  

ii. Duty to Give Information. 

iii. Failure to Render Aid. 

  

iv. False Report of Accident. 

v. Driving with Suspended/Revoked License. 

vi. Unlawful Use of License (various types). 

vii. Reckless Driving. 

viii. Refusal to Submit to Chemical Tests. 

ix. Driving While Intoxicated.  

x. Unlawfully damaging a traffic control device.  

xi. Eluding an officer.  

b). These infractions:  

i. Red light violation.  

iv. Failure to Yield violation.  

v. Stop sign violations.  

vi. Careless Driving. 

ii. Speeding over 10 miles per hour over the limit.  

iii. Speeding in a School Zone (by any amount within reason) 

vii. Allowing Unlicensed Driver to Drive. 

viii. Leaving the Scene of an Accident (under $1,000 damage).  

3. Criminal violations and arrests.  

a). At accident scenes, if evidence concludes a violation of a criminal 
traffic law has occurred, an arrest shall be made except in cases of 
critical or fatal injury.  See ―Traffic--Injury and Fatal Traffic Accidents‖ 
(3.03.020) for details.  

b). In all other cases, an arrest will be made if sufficient evidence is 
discovered.  

4. Citations at accident scenes.  If evidence concludes a violation has 
occurred, a citation shall be issued except in cases of critical or fatal 
injury.  See ―Traffic--Injury and Fatal Traffic Accidents‖ (3.03.020) for 
details. 

F. Subsequent to Stop.  After a stop is made, officers shall: 

1. Ensure any property has been returned to the operator.  Some property 
must be retained for legal cause (evidence, suspended/revoked licenses, 
two licenses, and similar conditions), but all other property must be 
returned.  

2. Avoid following the violator once back into the flow of traffic. 

G. Charging Documents.  Depending on the violation, one or more of the 
following charging documents would be used: 

  

1. Parking Citation, to charge the civil violations found in the parking 
ordinances. 

2. Taxicab Violation, to charge taxicab operators with violations of those 
laws dealing only with the operation of ―for hire‖ commercial vehicles.  

3. Uniform Summons and Complaint, which can be used to charge both 
infractions found in the traffic code, and various misdemeanor (criminal) 
offenses which meet certain criteria (see 3.02.085, "Misdemeanor 
Citations," for details). 

H. Juveniles.  Officers are reminded that within traffic law enforcement, 
juveniles are processed almost identically to their adult counterparts, with the 
following few exceptions: 

1. Infractions.  

a). If a juvenile is charged with violating a traffic infraction which can be 
resolved by mail, he/she is issued a citation indistinguishable from an 
adult citation.  The minor is entitled to remedy the infraction by mailing 
in the dollar amount entered by the officer from the Bail Schedule, just 
as an adult could do.  Should the minor elect to contest the citation in 
court, a parent must also be present--but the court system will advise 
the minor of that fact when setting a court date, not officers. 

b). If a juvenile is charged with violating a traffic infraction which 
requires court appearance, officers will write on that citation 
―Mandatory Court--Parent Must Appear.‖  

2. Criminal violations of the traffic code.  If a juvenile violates a traffic law 
which is criminal, he/she is arrested and processed exactly as an adult 
would be. If the traffic offense and circumstances would warrant an adult 
receiving a Misdemeanor Citation, then an equivalent scenario would 
allow a juvenile to be issued the same Misdemeanor Citation.  Conversely, 
if an adult would be brought before a Magistrate for bail setting, so would 
the subject juvenile.  The officer retains the same responsibility for the 
preparation of the Court Complaint with a juvenile offender (if such would 
be appropriate for an adult).  The sole difference is that, should detention 
be appropriate/ordered, that detention would occur at McLaughlin Youth 
Center.  See the procedure ―Arrests--Juveniles.‖ (3.02.080) for details. 

I. Additional Material.  The actual method of taking custody of a violator and 
charging him is discussed extensively in the chapter ―Arrest and Custody,‖ 
especially noting the procedures on Infractions and Civil Violations. 

II. PARKING ENFORCEMENT 

A. Jurisdiction.  Parking violations can be cited on publicly owned or private 
property within the municipality.  The only limitation is that the parking 
violation must occur in the citing officer's presence. 

B. Violations Alleged on a Parking Citation.  Information regarding the proper 
completion of that form can be found in the Report Writing Manual.  Note that 

  

to allege any violation not appearing as a pre-printed box, officers must write 
the equivalent information in the "Comments" area of the Parking Citation. 

C. Citations May Be Issued By Sworn Officers, Community Services Officers 
(CSOs), or Contracted Agents. 

D. Impounding as a Result of a Parking Violation.  Complete information 
regarding impounding can be found in the procedure ―Towing--Impounds,‖ 
including special procedures such as ―Over 24 hours‖ and ―Trailers Parked 
Over One Hour.‖ 

III. MOVING VIOLATIONS 

A. Jurisdiction.  Anchorage Municipal Code Title 9 applies to all property 
within the Municipality.  As such, citations can be issued and arrests 
conducted on both public and private property unless limited by the language 
of the ordinance in question.  Officers must, therefore, be conscious of that 
language, and assess its applicability under the prevailing circumstances.  To 
aid officers in this assessment, consider the following: 

1. An ordinance with no restrictor applies anywhere within the Municipality.  
An example is AMC 9.36.160, Boarding or Alighting from Vehicles, which 
states ―No person may board or alight from any vehicle while such vehicle 
is in motion.‖ 

2. An ordinance with a restrictor, such as ―on a street‖ or ―roadway,‖ 
narrows the scope of the law.  Such a law would only apply to conditions 
specified.  In this example, the violation could not occur in a field or closed 
parking lot, since:  

a). ―Street‖ is defined as ―the entire width between the boundary lines 
of every way open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular 
travel.‖ 

b). ―Roadway‖ is the travelled part of a street.  Consequently, if an 
ordinance forbids a certain act ―on a roadway,‖ the language narrows 
the act to occurring on the travelled portion only.  

3. Some ordinances will specify applicability.  For instance, AMC 9.26.020 
A. states a maximum speed of ―Fifteen miles per hour in any alley or 
public parking lot;‖ and AMC 9.36.240, Trespass in Parking Lots, makes it 
―…unlawful for any driver, passenger, pedestrian or other person to enter 
or remain within a public or private parking lot in violation of a clearly 
visible sign posted by the owner or operator of such lot, which sign sets 
forth rules of occupation of the said lot during specified times.‖ 

B. State Traffic Charges.  If a Municipal law or ordinance addresses the 
violation, then that provision should be cited instead of the State equivalent. 
However, there are a few State traffic laws which have no Municipal 
equivalent so, when encountered, officers should cite that State law. 

C. Charging Document. 

  

1. Most moving violations are infractions, which are normally charged on a 
Uniform Summons and Complaint, and served either by:  

a). Personal service by officers; or  

b). Summons, mailed through the Traffic Court.  

2. Some violations are criminal, so may appear on: 

a). a Uniform Summons and Complaint as a Misdemeanor Citation; or  

b). a Court Complaint. 

D. Inspectable Offenses. 

1. Certain infractions have an additional remedy beyond resolution by mail 
or court appearance.  These are the ―inspectable offenses,‖ and give the 
violator the additional option of correcting the deficiency and having it 
inspected. If satisfactorily corrected, the citation is voided.  These are 
called ―inspectable offenses,‖ or ―equipment violations.‖  As with any other 
infraction, if no action is taken, a warrant can be issued. Note the different 
categories of inspectable offenses:  

a). Equipment violations charged under AMC 9.44 which are 
inspectable may be inspected anytime within 7 days at the police 
station during business hours.  

b). Excessive exhaust smoke violations (AMC 9.44.330 A-E) are 
inspectable by contacting the Inspection Referee Facility at 561-3111 
within 10 days of receiving the citation to make an appointment for 
inspection. 

c). Excessive exhaust noise violations (AMC 9.44.330 A-E) are 
inspectable within 10 days at the Department of Environmental Quality, 
825 L Street, during normal business hours. 

d). Mandatory Infractions are inspectable within 5 days in a normal 
traffic court hearing. Most notable are:  

i. AMC 9.12.030 No Operators License in Possession, which is a 2-
point correctable violation requiring resolution in court.  

ii. AMC 9.44.010 A Operating an Unsafe Vehicle, which is a O-
point, mandatory court infraction.  

2. Large Trucks. Semi's and other large vehicles can be issued 
inspectable equipment citations like any other vehicle.  However, because 
of the size and occasional specialized equipment involved, a different 
inspection process is used:  

a). The violator must contact the Traffic Section during normal 
business hours to arrange an inspection location and time.  

b). Inspections will not be conducted in the Department lot.  Normally, 
weigh stations are used.  

  

c). Field Inspections. Officers may inspect repair work in the field.  If a 
violator successfully repairs any deficiencies which the Department 
may inspect, officers may conduct the inspection in the field, and bring 
the citation into the station for voiding and processing. 

IV. COMMERCIAL VEHICLES 

A. Street Restrictions.  The Municipal Traffic Engineer has designated certain 
Anchorage streets on which the operation of commercial vehicles and large 
trucks would create exceptionally hazardous conditions or cause undue public 
inconvenience.  Traffic Engineering has erected appropriate signs, or outlined 
in Title 9 of the Municipal Traffic Code, certain streets or routes where 
commercial vehicles or trucks are prohibited. 

1. Action to be taken.  When officers observe a violation of a posted sign 
or designated truck route prohibiting commercial vehicles, trucks, or 
vehicles over 11,000 lbs., a citation can be issued under one of the 
following Municipal Traffic Ordinances: 

a). 9.46.090 A-D Allowable Gross Weights (Overweight) 0-points/$.05 
per lb. 

b). 9.46.360 Load Restrictions on Certain Streets (Overweight - unable 
to weigh) 0-points/$100.00. 

c). 9.46.370 B Commercial Vehicles Restricted (Signs posted which 
prohibit use) 2-points/$60.00. 

d). 9.46.410 A-H Trucks Prohibited on Certain Streets 2-points/$75.00. 

2. If more than one section applies, only issue a citation for the most 
serious violation.  

3. When observing flagrant overweight violations, you may wish to contact 
the Traffic Section to determine if a set of portable scales is available in 
the area.  If not, direct the truck driver to proceed to the nearest State 
Weigh station.  

a). There are weigh stations located south of Potters Marsh on the 
Seward Highway and on the Glenn Highway north of the Fort 
Richardson gate.  

b).Some commercial trucks carry pit slips from State certified weight 
scales which give the exact weight of the vehicle.  The State DMV 
registration form also indicates the truck's unladen (empty) weight.

To instruct all personnel in the processing of traffic collisions. 

Officers will respond to reports of collisions and determine if investigation is 
required by the Anchorage Police Department as outlined below. 

PURPOSE 
 

 

POLICY 

 
DEFINITIONS 
 

Traffic Collision.  A sequence of unintentional events involving one or more motor 
vehicles resulting in observable damage, injury, or death. 

Non-Injury Collision  A traffic collision which results in property damage and/or 
physical injury so slight that medical attention would not reasonably be sought. 

Injury Traffic Collision.  A traffic collision resulting in physical injury great enough 
to warrant medical attention of any degree. 

Hit and Run (H & R).  The common term for the crime of ―Leaving the Scene of a 
Collision‖ (―LSA‖), where the operator(s) have an obligation to remain and/or 
leave information.  Hit and run is consummated if the operator fails to remain or 
leave notice even on a collision so slight as to not require a formal report. 

  

Fatal collision- Any vehicle collision where one or more persons are immediately 
killed, or death appears to be imminent, as a result of the collision. 

Physical injury- As defined by Alaska Statute 11.81.900 (b)- ―physical injury 
means a physical pain or an impairment of physical condition.‖ 

Serious physical injury- As defined by Alaska Statute 11.81.900(b)- ―physical 
injury that causes serious and protracted disfigurement, protracted impairment of 
health, protracted loss or impairment of the function of a body member or organ, 
or that unlawfully terminates a pregnancy.‖ 

 
PROCEDURE 

NON INJURY COLLISIONS 

A.  RESPONSE 

1.  Dispatch.  Dispatch will send officers to reports of collisions to 

determine if investigation by APD is required.  

a.  Dispatch may explain to people involved in non-injury collisions that 
do not require an investigation by an officer how the matter can be 
settled without police involvement, and how to report the crash 
online at http://reportcrash.alaska.gov/.  

2.  Vehicle Descriptions Not Required at Dispatch. When initially 
dispatching an officer to a traffic collision, furnishing vehicle 
description(s) is not required, and the officer should not request such 
description(s) unless the subject vehicle(s) cannot be located. 

3.  Response Code.  Non-injury collisions are dispatched Code 2. 

B.  ARRIVAL AT SCENE 

guidelines. 

1.  Determine if Investigation is Required. See section C 2 below for 

2.  Critical Initial Steps.  Even in a minor, non-injury collision investigation, 
the initial steps the officer takes are critical to the welfare of the public 
and the quality of the investigation.  The following guidelines are 
offered: 

a.  Assess the scene from a distance as you approach.  This serves to:  

1)  Suggest the best positioning of the patrol vehicle.  

2)  Alert officers to certain dangers, most notably:  

a)  Hazardous materials.  

b)  Power lines down.  

c)  Debris on roadway.  

scene.  

3)  Provide information for possible re-routing of traffic around the 

  

b.  Protect the scene. The scene must be protected (by patrol car 

positioning and lighting, cones, flares, and/or other units) to achieve 
two vital purposes:  

1)  Prevent secondary collisions, which can be more severe than 

the original collision; and  

2)  Preserve evidence for the investigation.  

c.  Confirm there are no injuries. With the scene protected, the medical 
conditions of the victim(s) require immediate attention.  Since this 
procedure deals with non-injury collisions, it will be assumed 
officers have confirmed all parties are uninjured.  For injury 
collisions, see Section II of this policy.  

d.  Identify the witnesses. Officers will attempt to identify and interview 

witnesses.  

e.  Assess Vehicle Removal. Officers should begin to assess when 
and how to remove the vehicle(s) and debris. In the interest of 
safety and traffic flow, the traffic way should be cleared as soon as 
possible, and officers should allow ―lead time‖ for the towing 
equipment to arrive. 

C.  INVESTIGATING THE COLLISION 

1.  Investigating Responsibility.  The Traffic Unit has the primary 

responsibility for investigating non-injury traffic collisions; however 
Patrol Officers shall be dispatched if Traffic Officers are not available. 

2.  Criteria for Completing an Investigation and State ―Report on Traffic 
Collision.‖  Department policy regarding the completion of the State 
Report on Traffic Collision by an Officer is as follows: 

a.  A report is required on any traffic collision when: 

1)  Any government vehicle or commercial vehicle is involved, even 

if the parties do not want to make a report, or 

2)  There is damage to government property, or 

3)  There is any physical injury, even if the parties do not want to 

make a report, or 

4)  A criminal offense has occurred or any party does not have 
proof of insurance, even if the parties do not want to make a 
report, or 

5)  The involved vehicles can not be driven away from the scene, or 

6)  A Hit and Run collision with viable suspect information, or 

7)  The collision was a result of any police action, with the 

exception of blocking, pinning, PIT maneuvers, or intentional 
ramming. 

  

3.  Proper Completion of the State Report on Traffic Collision. Officers will 
complete traffic collision report forms as trained and by standards set 
by the Department and State of Alaska. 

D.  Non-Investigated Collisions 

1.  Clearing of Roadway. Citizens should be advised by dispatch of the 
requirement to move their vehicles and any debris off of the roadway 
as soon as possible. 

2.  Private Property. The Department will respond to collisions on private 
property according to the guidelines in this policy and procedure. 

3.  Hit and Run – No Suspect Information. The Department will not 

respond to hit and run collisions of unoccupied victim vehicles or 
property damage (including government property) where there is no 
suspect information and no injury. 

4.  Notification. Involved citizens will be given an APD Collision 

Information Card that directs them to report the crash and complete a 
Notice of Financial Responsibility form online at 
http://reportcrash.alaska.gov/. 

5.  Verification of Information. Officers will verify that the driver and vehicle 
information that the citizens exchange is correct and accurate, that the 
proof of insurance for each driver appears valid, and that no criminal 
activity has occurred. Upon leaving the scene of the collision, officers 
will notify dispatch that the information was verified by using the CAD 
disposition code ―V‖, i.e. ―10-8V‖. 

E.  DISPOSITION 

1.  Vehicle Removal.  Clearing the collision scene as quickly as practical 
is in the best interest of safety and traffic flow.  Once officers have 
gained the physical evidence necessary for the investigation, effort 
should be made to move the vehicles. The following guidelines are 
provided: 

a.  The law requires the operators of vehicles involved in traffic 

collisions to not unnecessarily obstruct traffic (9.10.020). Dispatch 
should encourage citizens to move their vehicles off of the roadway 
if possible.  

b.  Even if safely parked, officers should assess the theft and 

vandalism vulnerability of an involved vehicle left unattended at the 
scene.  

c.  With the owner‘s permission, officers may consider pushing a 
disabled vehicle to a safe parking area if their patrol vehicle is 
capable.  

d.  If the officer decides that towing is required for any reason, the 

following would apply:  

  

1)  Assist the operator in summoning the towing company of their 
choice. If the operator has no preference, but is still willing and 
able to take responsibility of the vehicle, then the Dispatch 
approved tow agency rotation list may be used. 

2)  If the owner/operator is unwilling or unable to make these 
arrangements, the officer may impound the vehicle for 
safekeeping.  For details, consult the procedure "Towing--
Impounds". 

2.  Issuing Citations.  It is firm Departmental policy to issue citations for 

traffic violations at collisions if the evidence concludes such violation(s) 
occurred.  Be reminded: 

a.  Citations may be issued to more than one operator. 

b.  Citations can be issued at a later date if the investigation is not 

completed at the scene. 

c.  Citations should not be issued if the collision is not investigated by 

APD and documented on a State of Alaska collision form. 

3.  Notice of the requirement for ―Certificate of Insurance‖ forms (i.e. 

―Financial Responsibility Notices"). The operator of a vehicle involved 
in a collision investigated by APD shall be advised via an APD 
Collision Information Card to go online to http://reportcrash.alaska.gov/ 
and complete the certificate of insurance form and submit it to the 
Department of Motor Vehicles. Operators who do not submit this form 
to the State of Alaska will have their license suspended as an 
uninsured motorist. 

4.  Arrests.  Recall that some traffic violations are criminal (versus 

infraction or civil), so arrests can occur.  Should the officer make a 
traffic arrest: 

a.  Some arrests can be concluded with Misdemeanor Citations (see 

the procedure so titled for details). 

b.  Juveniles arrested under the traffic code are processed identically 
to their adult counterparts, including the issuance of the various 
citations, with two exceptions: 

1)  Parent(s) must appear with the minor in any court appearances 

the minor might have; and 

2)  If a booking is ordered or required, it shall occur at McLaughlin 
Youth Center (see the procedure entitled "Arrests--Juveniles" 
for details). 

5.  Public Assistance.  Prior to leaving the scene, officers should be 

available to provide reasonable assistance to the collision victims.  
Also, ensure that the parties have exchanged the information required 
by law, such as name, contact info, insurance info, etc. 

  

6.  Return of Property.  Officers should ensure that all property has been 
returned to the correct owner.  Note especially operator's licenses, 
registrations, keys, and other items normally needed by officers.  This 
would, of course, exclude property retained as evidence. 

7.  Notifications.  In any collision investigated by APD, each party will be 

advised of the police report case number by the officer, and that copies 
of the collision report will be available at the front counter of the police 
station after 5 business days. 

8.  Road Debris.  AMC 9.36.100 (C) states "Any person removing a 

wrecked or damaged vehicle from a publicly maintained street shall 
remove any glass or other injurious substances dropped upon the 
highway from such vehicle."  Officers are to enforce this provision, as it 
applies to both towing equipment operators and private individuals.  In 
any case where substantial debris is left on the roadway, or if the road 
or traffic equipment is damaged, officers should notify the appropriate 
agency. 

F.  MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES 

1.  Collisions Not Investigated at the Scene.  Dispatch or an officer will 

inform the party or parties of their obligation to complete form 12-209, 
Motor Vehicle Crash Form, online at http://reportcrash.alaska.gov/.  
Officers will not investigate a non-injury collision where the parties 
agreed to party settle and have left the scene prior to APD arrival. 

2.  Special Vehicles.  When investigating collisions involving the following 
vehicles, officers must comply with the special considerations listed: 

a.  Alaska Railroad and Alaska Railroad vehicles.   

1)  Anticipate the railroad sending its Special Agent. 

2)  Expect the operator to refuse to answer questions until the 

Special Agent arrives.  The operator is instructed not to discuss 
the incident until that Special Agent arrives, and it is 
Departmental policy to honor that procedure. 

3)  List involved railroad personnel (engineer, conductor, etc.) on 
an Additional Information form instead of the State Traffic 
Collision form. The State has specific definitions of "operator" 
and "driver," and a determination has to be made later as to 
who was actually "operating" the train. 

b.  Postal vehicles. 

1)  Anticipate the Postal authorities dispatching a Postal Inspector. 

2)  Honor the operator's company policy not to discuss the incident 

until that Postal Inspector arrives. 

  

INJURY COLLISIONS & FATALITIES 

Response to collisions involving injuries, serious injuries, and fatalities will 
be conducted as indicated above with the following exceptions. 

A.  RESPONSE 

1.  Vehicle Descriptions Not Required at Dispatch. When initially 
dispatching an officer to a traffic collision, furnishing vehicle 
description(s) is not required, and the officer should not request such 
description(s) unless the subject vehicle(s) cannot be located. 

2.  Response Code.  Injury collisions are dispatched Code 3 

a.  As with any call, arriving safely is a primary consideration. 

b.  Arriving officers should consider reducing the code of any other 

responding units as soon as practical, including the medical unit(s), 
if the injuries are minor. 

c.  Although Traffic Officers will respond if available, the nearest Patrol 
Officers should be dispatched to provide assistance to the victims.  

3.  Serious Injuries and Fatalities. Once it is determined that a collision 
involves a serious physical injury or a fatality, officers should notify a 
shift Supervisor to initiate contact with the Traffic Unit Supervisor. See 
Traffic Unit Coordination policy for call-out guidelines. 

B.  ARRIVAL AT SCENE 

1.  Critical Initial Steps.  The initial steps the officer takes are critical to the 
welfare of the public and the quality of the investigation.  The following 
guidelines are offered: 

a.  Assess the scene from a distance as you approach.  This serves to:  

1)  Suggest the best positioning of the patrol vehicle.  

2)  Alert officers to certain dangers, most notably:  

a)  Hazardous materials.  

b)  Power lines down.  

c)  Debris on roadway.  

scene.  

3)  Provide information for possible re-routing of traffic around the 

b.  Protect the scene. The scene must be protected (by patrol car 

positioning and lighting, cones, flares, and/or other units) to achieve 
two vital purposes:  

1)  Prevent secondary collisions, which can be more severe than 

the original collision; and  

 

 

  

2)  Preserve evidence for the investigation. Recall that a serious 
traffic accident is to be regarded as a felony crime scene until 
evidence concludes otherwise.  

c.  Attend to medical assistance.  With the scene protected, the 

victim(s) can be given medical attention.  Officers are reminded 
that, if the injuries are minor, reducing the code of the responding 
medical unit is best for overall safety. Identify the witnesses.  
Officers will attempt to identify and interview witnesses.  

d.  Identify the witnesses.  Since many witnesses are reluctant to 

remain at the scene or volunteer information, responding officers 
should immediately begin identifying and recording witnesses.  For 
serious and fatal collisions which the Traffic Unit will investigate, 
officers may do the initial interviewing for the Traffic Unit. For 
collisions with fatal or potentially fatal accidents, or for any collision 
involving injuries which require hospitalization, all interviews with 
drivers, witnesses, or passengers shall be recorded and submitted 
as per the APD digital evidence policy. 

e.  Photographs. Officers shall take photographs at any collision that 
involves a report of injury. If the Traffic Unit is responding to a 
serious or fatal crash, initial photographs of the scene can be very 
useful and should still be taken by patrol. 

f.  Notifications. Should the collision result in critical injuries or death, 
the responding officer should coordinate with a shift Supervisor to 
notify the Traffic Supervisor. See Traffic Unit Coordination 
Procedure for guidelines. 

g.  Implied Consent Blood Draws. Responding officers should follow 

established guidelines for implied consent blood draws for serious 
injury and fatality collisions. If it is determined that a collision meets 
those guidelines, the blood draw process may be started 
immediately. Officers shall coordinate the blood draw with the 
Traffic Unit Fatality Investigator assigned to the collision when 
Traffic assumes responsibility for a collision. 

1)  Officers who complete a blood draw shall fill out a lab request 
form, to have the blood tested, at the time the evidence is 
submitted to Property and Evidence. 

h.  Assess vehicle removal. Officers should begin to assess when and 
how to remove the vehicle(s) and debris.  Unlike a minor collision, a 
serious collision can entail protracted crime scene processing 
and/or impoundment for evidence, so this consideration may be 
more detailed.  However, in the interest of safety and convenience, 
the traffic-way should be cleared as soon as practical.  Although a 
discussion of towing arrangements can be found earlier in this 
procedure, this step is included here to remind the officer to 

  

coordinate vehicle removal with the Fatality Investigator if a traffic 
call out has been initiated.  

C.  INVESTIGATING THE COLLISION 

1.  Investigating Responsibility.  The Traffic Unit has the primary 

responsibility for investigating injury traffic collisions. If no Traffic Units 
are available, this responsibility shall pass to Patrol, except that 
Serious Injury Collisions and Fatalities may be handled by Traffic Unit 
call out. See Traffic Unit Coordination Policy for guidelines. 

2.  Officer‘s Duties after Notification of Traffic Unit.  The Traffic Unit may 

delegate the investigation to Uniformed Patrol.  Should the Traffic Unit 
assume responsibility, however, the officer‘s primary duties are those 
listed in Section B. above (protect scene, secure witnesses, attend to 
medical attention, etc.). 

3.  Completing a State ―Report on Traffic Collision.‖  A collision report will 

be made on any collision involving an injury.  

4.  Proper Completion of the State Report on Traffic Collision. Officers will 
complete traffic collision report forms as trained and by standards set 
by the Department and State of Alaska. 

a.  In the event of a Traffic Unit call out to complete a serious injury or 
fatality collision investigation, responding patrol officers will still be 
required to complete the collision report for all vehicles involved 
including their drivers and passengers. Any witness interviewed by 
patrol should also be included in a collision report or supplemental 
report. 

D.  DISPOSITION 

1.  General Disposition. For details on disposition see Section I. The 

following differences are noted for injury, serious injury, and fatality 
collisions. 

2.  Vehicle Removal.  Vehicle removal is the same as in Section I except 
for the requirement to coordinate with the Fatality Investigator if the 
Traffic Unit has been called out. 

3.  Issuing Citations.  It is firm Departmental policy to issue citations for 

traffic violations at collisions if the evidence concludes such violation(s) 
occurred.  Be reminded: 

a.  Citations may be issued to more than one operator. 

b.  Citations can be issued at a later date if the investigation is not 

completed at the scene. 

c.  Citations should not be issued when a criminal offense is believed 
to have occurred, or if the Traffic Unit has assumed responsibility 
for the investigation. 

  

4.  Return of Property. Return of property should be coordinated to ensure 
that it does not interfere with any criminal investigation that may result 
from the collision. 

Road Debris. Road debris should be handled as indicated in Section I 
except that it should not be moved until the investigation has been 
completed.

3.04.020  Evidence--Withdrawal and Return Policy 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DEFINITIONS 

PROCEDURE 

To advise all personnel of the procedures for the withdrawal and return of 
property and evidence released from the Property and Evidence Section. 

It is the policy of the Anchorage Police Department to maintain responsibility for 
protecting and preserving all classifications of property coming under its control, 
including the chain-of-custody, and the integrity of the property, the department 
and the custodial employee. 

All definitions for this procedure are the same as those contained in the Property 
and Evidence Handling and Submission procedure. 

I. WITHDRAWAL AND RETURN OF PROPERTY--Generally 

A. Withdrawal of Property: 

1. Property, with the classification of either evidence, found, or 
safekeeping, may be temporarily withdrawn from the Property and 
Evidence Section for: 

a). Intra agency reasons (e.g.; for purposes of investigation, 
examination, identification, laboratory or forensic examination), or, 

b). Inter-agency reasons (e.g.; for laboratory or forensic examination, 
court, or viewing by legal counsel or other authorized individuals) 

2. Property, with any classification, shall not be temporarily withdrawn for 
municipal, department or personal use. 

B. Return of Property: 

  

1. Return of property means to return any property previously withdrawn 
by authorized personnel back into the custody of the Property and 
Evidence Section. 

II. WITHDRAWAL OF PROPERTY--Procedure 

A. Personnel authorized to withdraw property: 

1. Only federal, state, or municipal law enforcement personnel, acting 
under the color of authority, are authorized to withdraw property from the 
Anchorage Police Department Property and Evidence Section. 

B. Property Withdrawal Procedure: 

1. Whenever the temporary release of property from the Property and 
Evidence Section is required, authorized personnel shall: 

a). make every reasonable attempt to provide the Property and 
Evidence Section with a minimum twenty-four hour advance notice of 
the date and time they prefer an appointment to withdraw property.  
Although a "rush request" for court related property withdrawals will be 
honored, there is increased probability for delayed delivery due to 
retrieval time from multiple, or remote, storage locations.   

b). deliver an itemized list of the property requested for withdrawal, 
either by e-mail to "!APD P&E", or a legible handwritten list, stating the 
purpose (court, investigation, lab), identifying the person authorized to 
pick up the property, and the police case number including a list of the 
property by police case number, tag number and a brief description of 
each item. 

c). At the time property is checked out, sign their name, designated 
serial number, and the date accepted, on the Property and Evidence 
Hand Receipt under "received by" prior to delivery.   

d). When transferring custody, deliver the property and the duplicate 
unsigned Property and Evidence Hand Receipt to its final destination.  
The receiving person shall print and sign their name, record the date 
and time the property was delivered under "received by", prior to the 
release and transfer of custody. 

e). Within 24 hours of checking property out, either return the property, 
or the completed and signed Property and Evidence Hand Receipt, to 
the Property and Evidence Section. 

2. Whenever the temporary release of property from the Property and 
Evidence Section is required, Property and Evidence Technicians shall: 

a). Prepare a duplicate unsigned Property and Evidence Hand Receipt 
for the "received by" employee to use, whenever the property is 
intended to be delivered or transferred to another person, court or 
agency. 

  

b). At the time of release,  update the automated property transaction 
record and simultaneously record the date, their initials and designated 
serial number, (D.I.D.) on the Property and Evidence Hand Receipt 
under "received from" at the time of delivery to authorized law 
enforcement personnel. 

c). Upon delivery of a signed duplicate Property and Evidence Hand 
Receipt reflecting a custodial, update the automated chain-of-custody 
record to reflect the new custodian, new location, along with the 
delivery date and time. 

d). Attach the signed duplicate Property and Evidence Hand Receipt to 
the corresponding main property file located within the Property and 
Evidence Section.   

C. Property Viewing Procedure: 

1. Viewing Property: 

a). Viewing of property by victims, attorneys, or other persons, shall be 
conducted only by law enforcement personnel who are assigned as the 
case detective, case manager, or otherwise officially authorized, for 
purposes of an investigation, or to comply with a judicial "stipulation" or 
"motion for discovery".  Authorized personnel withdrawing property 
shall: 

i. coordinate in advance the date and time for the evidentiary 
viewing with both the prosecuting attorney and the Property and 
Evidence Section; 

ii. submit an itemized list of property required for the viewing and 
schedule an appointment to retrieve the  property required for 
viewing, to the Property and Evidence Section, sufficiently prior to 
the scheduled time for the evidentiary viewing; 

iii. locate and schedule in advance an appropriate location, of 
sufficient size, to facilitate the viewing.  Consideration should be 
given to avoid open work areas, not displace or disturb non 
involved personnel and potential scheduling conflicts with 
conference rooms.  Note: The Property and Evidence, Evidence 
Processing and Vestibule counters should not be utilized as 
viewing areas. 

D. Requests for Laboratory Services: 

1. Whenever it is determined property in the possession of the Anchorage 
Police Department requires laboratory examination or analysis, the 
requesting person shall: 

a). complete one of the following laboratory request forms: 

i. Anchorage Police Department, Forensic Unit, Request For 
Services 

  

ii. Anchorage Police Department, Request For Outside Laboratory 
Services 

iii. State of Alaska, Crime Laboratory, Request For Laboratory 
Services 

2. Request the Property and Evidence Section deliver, mail or ship, the 
property to the requested laboratory, or; 

3. Withdraw and deliver the property to the laboratory upon receipt of a

released to them demanding either the return of the property or the 
property or a signed and dated Property and Evidence Hand Receipt 
showing the successful transfer of custody. 

c). Notify the Technical Services Division Commander when the last 
known person in custody of the property has not complied with 
subsection III. A. 2 of this policy provision within the established

PART 3 Operational Procedures 

Chapter 5 

3.05.000  Use of Force and Weapons 

3.05.005  Electronic Control Devices 

The purpose of the policy is to advise all sworn personnel of the policies and 
procedures regarding Electronic Control Devices. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

All sworn officers must meet and comply with the requirements of this procedure.  
The electronic control devices authorized for use are the Advanced Taser M-26, 
X-26, X-2 and the X-3 manufactured by Taser International (Taser).  Other Taser 
devices may be approved by the Chief of Police.  Only Department owned and 
issued Tasers are authorized for use. 

All officers authorized by the Chain of Command to carry a Taser must be 
certified by an APD Taser Certified Instructor.  This training shall consist of a 
minimum of six hours of instruction with the successful completion of a written 
and proficiency exam.   

DISCUSSION 

Tasers are an Electronic Control Device.  Electronic Control Devices are 
considered intermediate weapons in the APD Response to Resistance policy.  
Officers are encouraged to review the Response to Resistance policy for 
clarification on the associated levels of resistance and control.   

The use of the Taser is intended solely as a control device to minimize injuries to 
officers, suspects, and others.  Its purpose is to enable the officer to carry out 
his/her duties in a safe, efficient, and professional manner.  The timely and 

 

  

appropriate use of the Taser can greatly reduce injuries to all involved.  Any 
escalated use of force may be thereby avoided. 

The Taser may be deployed as an additional police tool and is not intended to 
replace firearms or self-defense techniques.  A Taser may be applied with the 
following guidance: 

A. Active Aggression.  A Taser may be used by an officer in any situation 
where active aggression is met.   

B. Suicide Intervention.  A Taser may be used during acts of suicide 
intervention if attempts to gain compliance through verbal commands have 
failed and the officer reasonably believes its use is necessary to control the 
subject and prevent injury to the subject, officer(s), and other persons. 

C. Special Circumstances. Situations may exist based upon the suspect/s 
actions, outside of aggression or suicide intervention, that may justify the use 
of a Taser. Factors to consider in these situations include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 

1) whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade 
arrest and the crime taking/having taken place is a felony persons crime or 
misdemeanor assault/weapons crime. 

2) whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers 
or others, or exhibits actions that create a situation likely to further endanger 
officers or others. 

I. AUTHORIZED USE OF M26/X26/X2/X3 TASER 

PROCEDURES 

A. Officers authorized to carry a Taser shall undergo initial training and 
certification by a department Taser instructor. Officers shall attend annual 
refresher training coordinated by the department‘s lead Taser instructor. 

B. Officers are authorized to use the Taser consistent with the department 
Response to Resistance policy.  

C. The officer must give verbal warnings and commands to a resisting subject 
if the situation allows.  The warning should be similar to ―Drop the (weapon) 
and/or stop (suspect action) or I will use a Taser and you may be injured.‖  
Verbal warnings and commands are not necessary if reaction time is of the 
essence to officer safety or the safety of others.  

D. The Taser may be used in both the ―Drive Stun‖ mode and by firing the 
probes at a suspect.  When used in the ―Drive Stun‖ mode, officers should 
place the Taser on areas of the body most likely to result in immediate 
compliance by the suspect.  These areas include, but are not limited to: 
pressure point locations, large muscle groups, or other areas approved 
through the Taser Training program.  Officers should avoid ―Drive Stun‖ to 
sensitive areas such as the face, groin or female breast.   

  

E. Upon firing the Taser, the officer shall energize the subject the least 
number of times and no longer than reasonably necessary to accomplish the 
legitimate operational objective.  The subject may be secured as soon as 
practical while disabled by the Taser to minimize the number of deployment 
cycles. 

F. The Taser is not a substitute for deadly force.  It shall not be carried in 
place of a handgun.   

G. The Taser should not be used without a lethal force backup in situations 
where there is a substantial threat present. 

H. The head and face shall not be intentionally targeted.  Whenever possible, 
officers will aim for lower center mass (below the sternum and ribcage) when 
firing probes at the frontal chest area of a subject 

I. Anytime the Taser is to be discharged operationally, the officer using the 
Taser should, if possible, announce that they are about to discharge the 
Taser by saying ―Taser!‖, so that other officers will be aware that a shot is 
coming from a Taser.   

J. The Taser shall not be used as a means of punishment.   

K. The Taser may be used to provide ―Laser‖ and ―Spark‖ demonstrations to 
the suspect(s) prior to application of the Taser if the officer feels the 
demonstration will encourage the suspect(s) to voluntarily comply with the 
officer‘s instructions.   

L. The Taser may be used as an alternate means of animal control. 

M. The Taser is only to be worn on the user‘s support side, belt level, in a 
support-side draw position. Support side/cross-draw position is not authorized 
for normal duty use. Drop-leg style holsters are not authorized for normal duty 
use. Exceptions to this carry method, based upon special assignments (i.e. 
undercover operations, SWAT, etc.) can be authorized by individual unit 
Commanders.   

II. LIMITATIONS FOR USE OF TASER 

Do not use the Taser in the following situations: 

A. Any known or obviously pregnant female, except in extreme cases where 
there is a substantial risk of death to the subject if intervention doesn‘t occur 
and other force options have not worked. 

B. Any subject known to be saturated with or in the presence of highly 
flammable or combustible materials and liquids to include, OC, Mace, or other 
chemical defense sprays. 

C. Any subject who may fall from a high place, such as a roof or balcony. 

D. Any subject known to have a heart pacemaker device, except in extreme 
cases where there is a substantial risk of death to the subject if intervention 
doesn‘t occur and other force options have not worked. 

  

E. Any subject restrained by handcuffs or other mechanical restraints. 

III. DUTIES AFTER DISCHARGING THE TASER 

A. The Taser shall be turned off once the subject is restrained or has 
complied. 

B. Immediate action should be taken to care for any injured subjects, to 
apprehend any suspects, and to protect the scene. 

C. Medical personnel will be summoned to the scene to assess the subject if 
he or she is injured.  Medical treatment will not be refused for anyone who 
requests it. 

D. Probes located in sensitive areas such as the face, neck, groin or female 
breast will be removed by medical personnel.  Removal of probes in other 
areas may be done by officers at the scene.   

E. Photographs shall be taken of probe impact sites (preferably before the 
probes are removed) and any other related injuries as well as photographs of 
the scene.   

F. Involved personnel will attempt to locate and identify any witnesses to the 
incident. 

G. Conduct a civil interview with the subject.  The civil interview tape will be 
logged as evidence.  The civil interview will be conducted after any Miranda 
interview if the subject is under criminal investigation. 

H. Corrections or medical treatment facility personnel shall be informed the 
subject was controlled by the use of a Taser. 

IV. EVIDENCE COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS 

A. Deployed probes, cartridge(s) and wires shall be collected and retained as 
evidence.  Probes that have been removed from skin shall be treated as a 
―Bio-Hazard‖.  These items shall be packaged together as ―Taser 
Components,‖ in accordance with the Property and Evidence Packaging and 
Handling Procedure Manual. 

V. OFFICER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 

A. An officer who discharges a Taser will notify an on-duty supervisor as soon 
as possible.  The officer‘s actions and the surrounding circumstances shall be 
fully documented in a numbered police report. The officer who deployed the 
Taser will also complete the Taser Deployment Report form. 

B. The Taser Deployment Report form and supplemental documentation will 
be provided to a Taser Instructor for a training review. The Instructor will then 
forward the report to the officer‘s respective Commander for review. 

C. ―Spark‖ and ―Laser‖ demonstrations and animal control applications shall 
be documented in a police report and do not require documentation on a 
Taser Deployment Report form.  

  

B. The officer who discharges a Taser on any person will make the Taser 
available to a Taser Instructor at the earliest possible convenience to have 
the Taser‘s internal use data downloaded and attached to supplemental 
police report. 

C. Taser operators should routinely inspect their issues Taser for damage or 
wear.  Damaged or inoperable Taser will be turned over to a Taser Instructor 
as soon as possible for repair or replacement. 

D. Any Taser that is lost or stolen will be immediately reported to the Patrol 
Commander and documented in a police report.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.05.010  Firearms Training and Qualifications 

This policy advises all employees of the training and qualification requirements 
for firearms carried under color of authority.  

All employees shall meet all firearms training and qualification requirements 
mandated in this policy.  

Proficiency with a Primary Duty Handgun:  Proficiency with a Primary Duty 
Handgun is considered a condition of employment for sworn personnel.  This 
proficiency is evaluated in several ways: 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

General Officer Qualification Course 

Standardized malfunction clearance drills 

Reloads and other required manipulations 

Safety  

Sworn employees who fail to meet these standards consistently are unable to 
perform their duties as law enforcement officials.  In these situations, it is the 
responsibility of the Department to clearly communicate the actions to take if an 
employee fails to meet these standards. 

Supplementary and Second Only Handguns:  Supplementary and Secondary 
Handguns users must be qualified on an annual basis using an approved 
General Officer Qualification Course (long version).  When qualifying with a 
―Second Only‖ qualification course, that particular handgun may only be carried 
as a second gun to a primary duty handgun, even if that handgun chosen is of 
greater than .380ACP caliber.  Three (3) is the maximum number of handguns 
that an officer is allowed to be qualified to carry in a given year. 

  

Performance Standard:  Employees are required to pass the General Officer 
Handgun Qualification Course at least once a year with their primary duty 
handgun using factory new ammunition.  This qualification will be conducted by a 
current Firearms Instructor, using a ―Match‖ timer and fresh target.  The Officer 
will qualify in ―full duty gear‖, wearing a ballistic vest, which requires officers to 
wear their entire field uniform.  Detectives shall wear their outerwear with daily 
use holster and magazine pouches.  All firearms and related equipment are to be 
in compliance with the Department firearms policy.    

These qualification attempts will be referred to as ―Record Qualifications‖ and are 
different than ―Diagnostic Qualifications‖ or other training tools Firearms 
Instructors may employ during the course of training.  Employees will be granted 
two attempts to pass the annual Record Qualifications.  A second session of 
attempts will be offered on the next work day for any employee who fails to pass 
the first session.  As a reminder, the current firearms manual allows for two 
attempts at qualification per day – this policy will be applied to this training 
directive as well, therefore allowing the employee four (4) attempts to pass the 
Record Qualification over two days. 

Additionally, officers should attend periodic firearms training, which may or may 
not include diagnostic qualification courses. 

It is important to note that Firearms Instructors, Supervisors, or Commanders 
may recommend that employees be placed in a Remedial status based on 
observed shortcomings in any one of the four evaluated proficiency standards.  
These observations may be made either during training or in the field. 

In-Service Remedial Status:  Employees failing to meet one or more of the 
proficiency standards during training or as observed in the field shall be placed in 
an In-Service Remedial status.  These employees will remain in their current duty 
assignment during this period. 

Firearms Instructors identifying an employee as requiring the In-Service 
Remedial handgun training shall immediately inform that employee‘s Supervisor 
or Commander and the Training Commander, who in-turn will make notification 
through the chain of command to the appropriate Division Commander. 

Employees in an In-Service Remedial status may be kept in that status for the 
next four work weeks, during which time they will complete as many as 24 hours 
of Remedial Firearms Training with a Department approved instructor.  At least 8 
hours of Remedial training must be completed regardless of shooter 
improvement or test results.  Employees may ―test‖ out of their Remedial status 
at the end of the first 8 hours or at the end of any of their succeeding four (4) 
hour block of ongoing training sessions (each of which ends with a recorded 
qualification), up to the end of the 24 hour Remedial phase.  

Administrative Remedial Status:  Employees who are not able to test out of the 
24 hour In-Service Remedial phase will be relieved of normal enforcement duties 
to focus on Remedial training to regain proficiency.  The purpose of this status is 
to ensure the safety of the public and the officer.  This assignment does not 

  

prevent the officer from performing some limited duties that would not involve 
direct contact with the public. 

This second Remedial period will be administered by the Training Center‘s 
primary Firearms Instructors and shall last a sufficient period to reasonably 
accommodate the employee‘s ability to ―test out.‖  The Training Center 
Supervisor will keep the chain of command informed as to the shooter‘s progress 
through weekly reports. 

Additional Instructions:  A Firearms Instructor administering either the In-Service 
Remedial or Administrative Remedial training will ensure that the employee has a 
clear understanding of what will be required to be placed back into a full duty 
status.  This information will be communicated to the employee, verbally and in 
writing, as well as to their Supervisor, and the Training Lieutenant. This 
information includes: 

A. Department memo originating from the Chain of Command which 
communicates the employee‘s current Remedial status and the expectations 
of the employee and the instructor.  

B. An individual Training plan originating from the Firearms Instructor which 
communicates the items to be covered in the training, including;  

1. The diagnosis of the issue(s) 

2. The planned exercises to be performed 

3. Any additional testing, if deemed necessary 

4. The grading criteria to be used 

5. The timeline for completion

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a

3.05.015  Kinetic Energy Weapons 

This policy is designed to guide officers in the deployment of kinetic energy, or 
extended range impact projectiles. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

One of the major functions of the Anchorage Police Department is to save lives.  
Often time‘s officers are called to dynamic situations, such as a suicide threat, 
where a specialized use of force is necessary.  These situations frequently 
require force that is outside the normal scope of police response to resistance. 

Kinetic energy projectiles, used interchangeably with extended range impact 
projectiles, assist in that function.  Kinetic energy projectiles increase the 
potential for positive outcomes in dynamic situations; unfortunately they have a 
significant potential for causing death or serious physical injury.  Officers are 
authorized to use KE projectiles in situations such as suicide interventions, or 
where the threat levels warrant the use of these projectiles.  Due to the injury 
potential, Kinetic Energy projectiles are placed between deadly force and batons 
in the Department‘s response to resistance.  

Because of the complex nature of the weapons and ammunition used, the Kinetic 
Energy projectile program shall be maintained by the SWAT Less Lethal 
Weapons Cadre. 

DEFINITIONS 

ARWEN:  Anti Riot Weapon Enfield, a 37mm multi-shot weapon designed to fire 
various kinetic energy projectiles and chemical agents. 

Penn Arms Launcher: Manufacturer of approved 37mm/40mm kinetic energy 
projectiles, chemical agents and specialty munitions. 

―Bean bag‖ Ammunition:  Specialty impact munitions consisting of lead shot 
contained within a cloth, nylon or similar material bag.  A common lay term 
describing a projectile which conforms to the shape of the target upon impact. 

  

12ga Bean Bag ammunition is not authorized for use by members of the 
Anchorage Police Department. 

Direct Fire Ammunition:  Impact munitions which are designed to be fired directly 
at the human body. 

―Less Lethal‖ Force:  Force used which is less than deadly force.  Although this 
type of force, including the use of weapons and projectiles designed for ―less 
lethal‖ force, have the potential to cause death or serious physical injury, their 
intended usage minimizes that potential. 

―Pepperball‖ Ammunition:  Specialty ammunition fired from an air powered 
weapon. ―Pepperball‖ is specific to a manufacturer in Arizona, however the term 
is commonly used to describe similar weapon systems. These projectiles are 
fired using pressurized air guns. The projectiles impart lower impact energy than 
12 gauge, 37mm and 40mm weapons. The projectiles impart lower impact 
energy than 12 gauge and 37mm weapons.  These projectiles may also carry a 
payload, such as powdered OC and marking paints or dyes. 

―Rubber bullet‖ Ammunition:  Specialty impact munitions made of rubber, plastic, 
foam, or other similar material.  A common lay term describing a projectile which 
does not conform to the shape of the target upon impact.  

Skip Fire Ammunition:  Impact munitions which are designed to be fired into the 
ground several feet in front of a target.  Upon impact, the projectile ricochets into 
the lower extremities of the body.  These projectiles are not normally used to fire 
directly at the human body. 

PROCEDURE 

I. AUTHORIZED USE OF KINETIC ENERGY (KE) PROJECTILES 

A. The Department KE program will be supervised by the SWAT Commander. 

B. All authorized 37mm and 40mm KE weapons will be maintained by the 
SWAT Less Lethal Weapons Cadre. 

C. All KE weapons and ammunition will be selected based on 
recommendations of the SWAT Less Lethal Weapons Cadre, SWAT 
Command and with the approval of the Deputy Chief of Operations.  

D. Only trained SWAT officers will be issued 37mm and 40mm KE weapon 
systems. 

E. The SWAT officers‘ training will be consistent with the Anchorage Police 
Department Kinetic Energy Weapons training program. 

F. Patrol Officers may be trained to use 40mm kinetic energy weapons and 
associated 40mm specialty impact munitions. 

1. The Patrol Officers training will be consistent with the Anchorage Police 
Department Kinetic Energy Weapons training program. 

  

2. Trained Patrol Officers and Sergeants will have access to 40mm 
extended range launchers and approved 40mm impact munitions at the 
discretion of the Unit Commander and Shift Supervisors. 

a). The approved 40mm launchers will be stored in the less lethal safe 
inside the police station when not deployed in the field.  

b). The trained officers will check out the weapon and impact munitions 
at the start of every shift. 

c). The 40mm launcher and ammunition will be stored in a closed case 
and secured in the officers‘ trunk. The weapon will be stored unloaded 
during transport and will only be loaded by the officer when deploying 
in the field, consistent with the Kinetic Energy Weapons training 
received. 

d). Officers will not store any lethal force ammunition or other specialty 
ammunition (breaching or chemical agent projectiles) with 40mm 
impact munitions. 

G. KE projectiles may be used in support of, or with the application of a 
Taser. 

H. KE projectiles may be used in suicide intervention. The decision to use KE 
weapons in suicide intervention may be based upon one or any combination 
of the following criteria: 

1. The suspect is actively causing self-inflicted injuries. 

2. The suspect is attempting to leave the scene or evade officers. 

3. The suspect has initiated a countdown or timeline. 

4. The suspect is not responding to reasonable negotiation attempts. 

5. The suspect takes an action that elevates the threat level toward 
officers or another person. 

I. KE projectiles may be used as an alternate form of animal control. 

II. DEPLOYMENT OF KINETIC ENERGY PROJECTILES 

A. Once a need for KE projectiles has been established, officers may deploy 
with the appropriate KE weapon system.  

1. A supervisor should be present, if circumstances permit, at all situations 
where a KE weapon has been deployed. 

2. Supervisors do not need to be present when a KE weapon is deployed 
in animal control situations; however, the officer should inform a 
supervisor prior to deployment. 

B. A cover officer, preferably armed with a long gun, shall be assigned to the 
officer armed with a KE weapon.  

C. Officers deploying KE weapons should give a warning to the suspect as 
soon as is practical.  

  

1. Officers may not have time to issue a warning, or the situation may be 
such that a warning would worsen the problem. In these cases, the officer 
shall document the reasons a warning was not issued.  This 
documentation must go beyond a simple statement that the warning was 
not issued ―because of the element of surprise‖ or similar nature.  The 
reason the warning was not issued shall be fully documented. 

D. Officers using KE weapons will aim for an appropriate target area.  

1. Officers will not intentionally target the head, neck, chest, spine, and 
upper abdominal areas.  

2. Intentionally targeting the head, neck, chest, spine, and upper 
abdominal area will be considered deadly force. 

3. If authorized, officers will use ―Pepperball‖ weapons consistent with the 
―Pepperball‖ training program.  The ―Pepperball‖ training program may 
allow targeting the chest and upper abdominal area, in which case officers 
will be authorized to target the chest and upper abdominal area.  
However, the head and neck will not be intentionally targeted. 

4. Officers are not required to target the area of the body that will cause 
the least amount of injury first.  Officers should avoid striking major joints, 
such as the knee or elbow, whenever possible.  The target area of the 
body should be made based on reasonable facts given at the time the 
shoot decision is made. 

a). Officers may target the weapon arm as long as the impact does not 
increase the likelihood that the impact force will cause additional injury 
from the suspects‘ weapon.  For example, a suspect who is holding a 
knife to his throat could be assisted in causing injury to the throat if 
struck in the weapon arm. 

b). Officers may target the hand holding the weapon if impacting the 
hand does not cause a similar problem as listed above. 

III. POST DEPLOYMENT ACTIONS 

A. Any person in police custody who has been struck by a KE projectile shall 
be taken to a hospital for medical examination prior to release, remanding to 
jail or placement at Providence Mental Health.  

B. The use of KE projectiles will be documented according the Anchorage 
Police Department‘s Less Lethal Reporting Procedure.  

IV. SPECIAL APPLICATIONS FOR KINETIC ENERGY PROJECTILES 

A. KE projectiles may be used in Crowd Management situations under the 
current training and deployment procedures for the Anchorage Police 
Department Mobile Field Force program.  

B. The use of foam baton rounds is authorized in either a ―skip fire‖ or ―direct 
fire‖ application based on the current Mobile Field Force program.  

  

C. This policy does not prevent the Department from obtaining and deploying 
―Pepperball‖ or similar weapons and ammunition.  The Chief of Police, or his 
designee, may authorize the use of ―Pepperball‖ or similar weapons and 
ammunition based on recommendations from the SWAT Commander and the 
Less Lethal Weapons Cadre.  

D. Any approved ―Pepperball,‖ or similar style weapon, will be deployed in a 
manner consistent with this policy.

the policy and procedure governing the specific weapons system used.  This 
policy applies solely to the reporting and review requirements associated with the 
actual application.  This policy is meant to be general and to apply not only to the 
less lethal weapons that are currently available, but also to any additional less 
lethal weapons systems that may be acquired in the future.  These procedures 
shall be used to document less lethal weapon applications that occur under the 
color of authority.  Applications occurring during training sessions are not 
considered official less lethal weapon applications and therefore are not subject 
to this policy.   

DEFINITIONS 

Less Lethal Weapon is a weapon designed as a force option not amounting to 
deadly force, including but not limited to Tasers, bean bag projectiles, baton 
rounds noise flash devices, and chemical agents.

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

For purposes of this procedure it is Department policy that:  

Officers shall accomplish their duties in a manner that minimizes the need for 
force and maximizes voluntary compliance.   

If applied, officers shall use only that level of control which is reasonably 
necessary and lawful in executing their duties as peace officers. 

When possible, officers should continue to attempt to gain compliance by means 
of verbal directives or commands. 

No employee of the department shall engage in any conduct that could 
reasonably be expected to unnecessarily escalate a situation‘s potential for 
violence.  

Justification for any level of control is limited to what reasonably appear to be the 
facts known or perceived by an officer at the time.  Facts unknown by the officer 
at that time, no matter how compelling in retrospect, cannot be used at a later 
time for justification.

PROCEDURE 

Basic Premise.  It is the policy of the Anchorage Police Department to allow 
officers to respond to resistance by using only that level of control which is 
reasonably necessary and lawful in the performance of their duties.  It is also 
departmental policy that officers are not required to use force if a reasonable and 
practical alternative can be found.   

I. RESISTANCE CONTROL CONTINUUM 

A. General.  The Resistance Control Continuum is divided into two 
categories: Levels of Resistance, describing resistive behavior by a subject, 
and Levels of Control, detailing an officer‘s methods of subject control.  

  

B. Levels of Resistance 

The following are the Levels of Resistance that are recognized by the Anchorage 
Police Department: 

1. Psychological Intimidation:  Psychological Intimidation is resistance that 
is indicated by nonverbal cues.  These nonverbal cues indicate the 
subject‘s attitude, physical readiness and potential physical resistance.  

2. Verbal Non-Compliance:  Verbal Non-Compliance is any verbal 
response indicating a subject‘s unwillingness to comply with lawful 
commands. 

3. Passive Resistance:  Passive Resistance is any type of resistance 
where the subject does not try to defeat the officer‘s attempt to touch or 
control the subject, but will not voluntarily comply with verbal or physical 
attempts to control. 

4. Defensive Resistance:  Defensive Resistance is any action by a subject 
that attempts to prevent an officer from gaining control.  It is not an attack 
on the officer but a physical act designed to prevent the officer from 
gaining control. 

5. Active Aggression:  Active Aggression includes physical 
actions/assaults against the officer or another person with less than 
deadly force. 

6. Deadly Force Assault:  Force used against an officer and/or another 
person that may result in serious physical injury or the loss of human life.   

C. Levels of Control:  It is important for officers to understand that they do not 
have to increase their level of control in a step by step progression.  Because 
subject resistance can begin anywhere on the continuum, officer response 
can begin at any point on the continuum that represents an ―objectively 
reasonable‖ response. 

The following are the Levels of Control that are recognized by the Anchorage 
Police Department.  The Department recognizes that individual officers may 
have a different response to the same situation based upon the totality of 
circumstances (e.g., relative size/stature of the officer/subject, the subject‘s 
actions, and relative capabilities of the subject and officer.) 

1. Officer Presence:  Officer Presence is a combination of symbols and 
items which identifies a person as a police officer.  Examples of a symbol 
or item which identifies a person as a police officer are a badge, police 
vehicle, uniform or verbal identification. 

2. Verbal Direction:  Verbal Direction is the articulation of the officer‘s 
lawful commands of direction or arrest. 

3. Soft Empty Hand Control:  Soft Empty Hand Control techniques are 
designed to control low levels of resistance.  These techniques have little 
potential for injury. 

  

4. Hard Empty Hand Control:  Hard Empty Hand Control techniques are 
designed to control Active Aggression and high levels of resistance when 
lower levels of control have failed or the officer reasonably believes lower 
levels of control will not be effective.  Hard Empty Hand Control 
techniques have a potential for injury. 

5. Intermediate Weapons:  Intermediate Weapon Control is the application 
of any tool that is not part of the human body to control resistance or 
Active Aggression.  Intermediate Weapon Control is justified when lower 
forms of control have failed or the officer believes that lower level control 
techniques will not be effective and deadly force is not authorized.  
Targeting the head, neck or spine with impact weapons is generally 
considered deadly force.  

6. Deadly Force:  Deadly Force may be used: 

a). in defense of the officer or another when the officer has reason to 
believe  there is imminent danger of death or serious physical injury; or 

b). to make an arrest or terminate the escape or attempted escape 
from custody of a subject that the officer reasonably believes has 
committed or attempted to commit a felony which involved the use of 
force against a person and may otherwise endanger life or inflict 
serious physical injury unless arrested without delay; or 

c). to make an arrest or terminate the escape or attempted escape 
from custody of a subject that the officer reasonably believes to be in 
possession of a firearm and may otherwise endanger life or inflict 
serious physical injury unless arrested without delay.   

II. WEAPONS 

A. This policy governs response to resistance generally, while the WEAPONS 
policy provides specific guidance regarding firearms, batons and oleoresin 
capsicum (OC) spray.  Both policies apply to any response to resistance/level 
of control involving those weapons. 

III. VASCULAR RESTRAINTS 

A. Vascular Restraints are designed to subdue violent and combative 
persons.  Vascular Restraints are the only approved neck holds.  Vascular 
Restraints are to be used only in the manner and under the circumstances 
taught in the Department‘s Recruit Academy and in-service training.  Vascular 
Restraints are classified as Hard Empty Hand Control.  

IV. TOTAL RESTRAINT 

A. Certain situations may require further restraint of a subject who continues 
to be combative after being handcuffed.  A total restraint method or leg 
restraints maybe used to control the subject.  Total Restraints are to be used 
only in the manner and under the circumstances taught in the Department‘s 
Recruit Academy and in-service training.  If a subject is in total restraints it is 

  

imperative that the subject be monitored closely at all times.  A second officer 
shall ride in the police vehicle to monitor the subject.   

V. REPORTS AND NOTIFICATIONS 

A. Required Reports.  Any time an employee of the Anchorage Police 
Department uses any of the Levels of Control beyond Verbal Direction (i.e. 
Soft Empty Hand Control, Hard Empty Hand Control, Intermediate Weapons 
or Deadly Force) that response to resistance shall be described clearly in an 
official, numbered police report.  In addition, any use of Hard Empty Hand 
Control or a higher level of control, or any level of control that results in injury 
to any person, shall be reported to the employee‘s supervisor immediately or 
as soon as practical, but in all cases, before the end of shift.   

The use of handcuffs in and of themselves do not require documentation in 
an official police report as the use of handcuff alone has no risk of injury.  An 
example of this would be transporting an intoxicated individual into protective 
custody for his/her safety.  If the handcuffing is merely a means of control for 
protection of the officer and the subject, there is no need to document the 
handcuffing in a police report.  This type of restraint does need to be 
documented in CAD, which can be done via the MDC. 

VI. SUPERVISORS MANDATORY REPORT 

A. Any incident involving the application of deadly force, damage to municipal 
property, any injury, or ―officer needs emergency assistance‖ (10-33) calls 
requires a memorandum from the on-scene commander or supervisor to the 
division captain and chain of command outlining the circumstances of the 
incident.   

B. In cases involving injury or property damage caused by an employee, 
supervisors will immediately notify the Municipal Risk Management office and 
fax copies of the report(s) to that office.  See General Order 03.12.12. 

In incidents involving intermediate weapons, vascular restraint, the application 
of deadly force, damage to municipal property and force resulting in injury, a 
supervisor response to resistance form must be filled out and forwarded to 
Internal Affairs. 

VII. FORCE REVIEW.  At the discretion of the Chief of Police, IA shall review all 
evidence pertaining to response to resistances issues. 

VIII. SUSPECTS AND PRISONERS 

A. During Custody. Prisoners shall be treated in a fair and humane manner at 
all times.  They shall not be subject to physical force other than as may be 
required to subdue violence or assure detention.  No officer shall strike a 
prisoner or suspect, except when necessary in the prevention of an escape or 
in self-defense, or in prevention of violence to another person. 

B. Safeguarding Suspects and Prisoners.  Officers shall be cautious in the 
arrest and detention of suspects or prisoners and shall take all necessary 
precautions to prevent an escape or damage to property.  Officers shall take 

  

necessary steps to determine that all prisoners are not in possession of 
weapons or dangerous instruments. 

IX. USE OF DEADLY FORCE RESULTING IN INJURY--EVALUATION 
REQUIRED  

A. Psychological Evaluation and/or Counseling Automatically Required.  
Whenever an employee of the Anchorage Police Department uses Deadly 
Force, and that force results in any serious physical injury or death, the 
employee shall automatically attend psychological evaluation and/or 
counseling.  This shall be at Department expense. 

X. USEOF FORCE DURING CROWD MANAGEMENT AND CROWN 
CONTROL 

A. Use of a Baton 

1. The use of a baton is permitted in crowd control situation as a pushing 
instrument or impact weapon, consistent with Mobile Field Force Training, 
to individuals who exhibit unlawful or hostile behavior and who do not 
respond to verbal direction by the police.    

B. Reporting the Use of a Baton 

1. Officers: 

a). When officers are working in organized squads and platoon-sized 
units, they are not required to document incidents in which the baton is 
used as a means to push or move a crowd.  

b). Officers shall, however, notify their immediate supervisor of the 
number of incidents where the baton was used during crowd control 
once the tactical situation has been resolved. 

2. Supervisors: 

a). Following a crowd control incident, those supervisors or Senior 
Officers filling the role of a Squad Leader are required to document the 
incident in a number police report.  Those items needing 
documentation within the entire report shall include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 

i. The events precipitating the use of crowd control tactics, 

ii. Justifications for the use of crowd control tactics,  

iii. Warning and or advisements given to the crowd, 

iv. Avenues of escapes provided,  

v. Methods used during the incident, and 

vi. Approximate number of baton applications by each member of 
the squad. 

b). A detailed police report is required for each baton use when 
officer(s) use the baton in a crowd control incident and become 

  

involved in an isolated incident with an individual in the crowd that 
goes beyond the movement of the crowd. 

XI. SHOOTING AT OR FROM MOVING VEHICLES 

a.  Use of Deadly Force. Other than under extreme circumstances, 
officers shall not fire at or from a moving vehicle unless use of 
deadly force is justified by something other than the threat from the 
moving vehicle. Such discharges will be rigorously scrutinized. 
Officers should avoid tactics that could place them in a position 
where a vehicle could be used against them. When confronted with 
and oncoming, moving vehicle, officers must attempt to move out of 
its path and should generally avoid placing themselves in situations 
where the use of deadly force is more likely. 

b.  Risk to Others. When officers are about to discharge their firearms, 
they should be aware of their field of fire, including the backstop, so 
as to not unnecessarily create a substantial risk of harm to others. 
Officers are prohibited from discharging their firearms when, based 
on the totality of the circumstances, discharging a firearm would 
constitute a greater risk to human life than the subject‘s actions. 
(e.g., discharging a firearm into a crowded vehicle or at a vehicle in 
a crowded area)

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.05.030  Investigation of Officer Involved Use of Deadly Force and 
In-Custody Deaths 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

To instruct all personnel of the policies and procedures governing the 
investigation of incidents involving an officer using deadly force against a person 
and In-Custody Deaths. 

Officers of the Anchorage Police Department may use deadly force under the 
following circumstances: in defense of the officer or another when the officer has 
reason to believe there is imminent danger of death or serious physical injury; to 
make an arrest or terminate the escape or attempted escape from custody of a 
subject who the officer reasonably believes has committed or attempted to 
commit a felony which involved the use of force against a person and who may 
otherwise endanger life or inflict serious physical injury unless arrested without 
delay; or to make an arrest or terminate the escape or attempted escape from 
custody of a subject the officer reasonably believes is in possession of a firearm 
and/or may otherwise endanger life or inflict serious physical injury unless 
arrested without delay. 

DISCUSSION 

The Department recognizes its responsibilities to the public and its employees to 
thoroughly investigate all instances of the use of deadly force and In-custody 
Death (ICD) in a timely manner.  The Department will conduct a criminal 
investigation of all uses of deadly force by officers and ICD.  An internal 
investigation by the Department‘s Internal Affairs Section shall be conducted to 
insure that Department policies were followed.  The criminal investigation will be 
completely independent of the internal investigation, although information 
gathered in the criminal investigation may be used by the Internal Affairs Section 

  

to determine whether further interviews are necessary and to determine whether 
the use of deadly force was within departmental policy. 

Keeping in mind that information gathered by the Internal Affairs Section may be 
discoverable to a defendant, internal investigations of ―in-custody‖ cases 
involving the use of deadly force shall be conducted after the criminal 
investigation and adjudication, if any, has been concluded.   

Historically the Anchorage District Attorney‘s Office has reviewed all cases 
involving the use of deadly force by Department officers and ICD.  The 
Department will continue to rely on the District Attorney‘s Office to review these 
cases.  The first purpose of the review is to determine if the officer(s) involved in 
the use of deadly force violated any laws of the State of Alaska.  The second 
purpose is to notify the Department as to the District Attorney‘s Office‘s intent, or 
lack thereof, to bring charges against the involved officer(s). 

Again, recognizing its responsibilities to the public and to its employees, the 
Department will look to the District Attorney‘s Office to conduct its review and to 
issue the Department a letter, explaining its findings and its intent in filing or 
declining charges. 

The Department recognizes the inherent possibility of stress in critical incidents 
and strives to support officers who, under color of authority and acting within the 
law, use deadly force, which results in serious physical injury or death.  Except 
as otherwise authorized by this policy, statements given by an officer in the 
course of criminal investigations of the use of deadly force will be voluntary 
statements, and the officer shall not be ordered or coerced in any way to give a 
statement.  The Department may choose to compel statements under the rules of 
Garrity vs. New Jersey, where such statements are taken in the course of an 
Internal Affairs investigation. 

DEFINITIONS 

Communication Restriction Order (CRO):  An order issued in writing during an 
investigation that restricts the involved officers and witness officers from 
discussing the facts of the case.  This restriction will be given in writing and will 
be lifted in writing. 

Deadly force:  Force which the person uses with the intent of causing, or uses 
under circumstances that the person knows create a substantial risk of causing, 
death or serious physical injury; ―deadly force‖ includes intentionally discharging

intentional and is not due to equipment malfunction and is considered deadly 
force when injury occurs. 

Witness Officer:  An officer who observes, or has first hand knowledge of, the 
events surrounding an in-custody death or the use of deadly physical force by 
another officer and, other than observing the incident, did not use deadly physical 
force. 

PROCEDURE 

Investigation of Officer-Involved Use of Deadly Force and In-Custody Deaths.  A 
standardized, thorough, impartial, and timely investigation into any officer-
involved use of deadly force or in-custody death is a responsibility owed to both 
the public and the involved officers.  To accomplish this, the following procedure 
applies: 

I. OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Officers as soon as practical will notify the on-scene supervisor and advise 
them of the officer‘s role in the incident (e.g., witness officer, involved officer, 
assisted at the scene). This notification is intended to identify those officers 
that detectives must attempt to interview in conjunction with their investigation 
of the incident. 

II. INVOLVED OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. The involved officer will notify an on-duty supervisor of the occurrence.   
The notification will take place as soon as possible.  

B. The involved officer, unless injured, will remain at the scene until released 
by an on-scene supervisor.  The Homicide Unit Sergeant or the Lead 
Investigator must approve the release from the scene.  The involved officer 
will not be held at the scene any longer than necessary.  

C. The involved officer will make it known to the on-scene supervisor that they 
are an involved officer, as defined.  

  

D. The involved officer will be afforded all rights guaranteed under the United 
States and State of Alaska Constitutions and the benefits of the current 
collective bargaining agreement throughout the investigation.  

E. The involved officer, if requested, is to give an on-scene briefing to 
detectives in order to ensure that the scene is processed properly.  This 
request will be made only when there are insufficient civilian or witness 
officers to ensure that the scene is processed properly, all evidence is 
located, and suspects are properly identified and charged.  

F. The involved officer will be provided time to discuss the incident with their 
immediate supervisor, union representative, and/or private attorney.  Officers 
will not discuss the incident with anyone other than those identified in the 
CRO once it is issued, until the CRO is removed.  

G. The involved officer will be asked, but not required, to voluntarily discuss 
the incident with detectives, following the incident, in order to ensure the 
prompt and accurate processing of the scene, the proper charging of any 
suspects, and an accurate investigation.  A union representative may be 
asked and may inform the detectives of the involved officer‘s decision on 
being interviewed right away or waiting 24 hours.  

H. If the involved officer declines to be interviewed immediately following the 
incident, arrangements will be made for the interview to take place within 24 
hours following the incident.  

I. Following an incident involving the use of deadly force, the involved officer 
will not drive a vehicle from the scene.  An uninvolved officer will be assigned 
to transport each involved officer.  Whenever possible, witness officers will 
also be transported by an uninvolved officer.  If not possible, the witness 
officer will transport himself or herself.  

III. WITNESS OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Witness officers will make it known to the on-scene supervisor if they are a 
witness to the incident (as defined) or assisted at the scene.  

B. All witness officers, unless injured, will remain at the scene until released 
by the Homicide Unit Sergeant or the Lead Investigator.  Witness officers will 
not be held at the scene any longer than necessary.  

C. Witness officers if requested, are required to give an on-scene briefing to 
detectives in order to ensure that the scene is processed properly, all 
evidence are located, and suspects are properly identified and charged.  This 
request will be made only when there are insufficient civilian witnesses.  

D. All witness officers will be afforded all rights guaranteed under the United 
States and State of Alaska Constitutions and the benefits of the current labor 
agreement throughout the investigation.  

E. Witness officers can consult a union representative, but should not discuss 
the incident with any other person prior to the conclusion of their investigative 
interview.  This does not preclude the witness officers from notifying his 

  

immediate supervisor of his role in the incident.  Officers will not discuss the 
incident with anyone other than those identified in the CRO once it is issued, 
until the CRO is removed.  

F. Witness officers will submit to an interview conducted by a detective from 
the Homicide Unit prior to going off shift if practical.  This interview will be 
conducted as quickly as possible.  If injured, the witness officer will be 
interviewed when medically stable.  The Detective Division Commander must 
approve exceptions.  Exceptions will be limited to those situations where the 
number of witnesses or the complexity of the investigation make it necessary 
for the investigators to obtain additional details of the incident prior to 
beginning an interview.  

IV. FIRST ARRIVING SUPERVISORS RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Secure the scene or ensure that the scene has been secured.  

B. Render first aid as needed.  

C. Identify and separate all involved officers and all witness officers. If the 
number of individuals to be physically separated is so great as to make it 
impractical, a supervisor or detective will be posted to ensure that no 
communication regarding the incident takes place.  

D. Ensure that a single entry point into and out of the scene is established 
and maintained.  

E. Ensure that a Crime Scene Entry Log is maintained at the entry point.  

F. Make required notifications in the following order:  

1. Appropriate Patrol Commander  

2. Homicide Unit Sergeant  

3. The appropriate bargaining unit representative.  

G. Ensure involved officer‘s weapons are retained in their holsters or 
otherwise secured pending weapon examination by responding detectives.  
Every attempt should be made to preserve the condition of the involved 
officer‘s weapon(s).  The preservation of the weapon should include but 
should not be limited to maintaining the current status of the chamber and all 
involved magazines. 

V. COMMANDER RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. If the involved officer is assigned to the Patrol Division then the Patrol 
Commander will make the required notifications in the following order:  

1. Patrol Captain.  

2. Internal Affairs  

3. If the involved officer is assigned to the Detective Division then the 
Patrol Commander will make the required notifications in the following 
order:  

  

a). Detective Captain.  

b). Internal Affairs  

VI. CHIEF OF POLICE RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. The Chief of Police will make the appropriate notification to the City 
Manager and the City Attorney.

E. Ensure that the CRO‘s are issued.  

F. Ensure that all weapons have been examined and documented as 
appropriate and ensure that the officer is supplied with a replacement weapon 
if appropriate.  

IX. DETECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Conduct a complete and thorough investigation of the incident.  The 
investigation will be used to determine justification for the use of deadly 
physical force, as well as to identify any training or policy concerns regarding 
the involved officer‘s actions.  

  

B. Conduct interview of all witness and Involved officers.  All interviews 
wherein material facts of the case are discussed will be recorded in their 
entirety.

F. Complete a Summary Report and case notebooks to include all transcripts 
of all taped statements.  

G. Submit all cases involving intentional use of deadly force, in-custody 
deaths and unintentional discharge resulting in injury to another to the District 
Attorney‘s Office for review.  

X. SUBSEQUENT DEPARTMENTAL ACTIONS 

Officers involved in a use of deadly force incident can expect the following to 
occur after arrival at the Department: 

A. The Department will request the opportunity to conduct a formal interview.  
Officers, like any other citizen, may feel the need to contact or speak with 
other persons, including an attorney prior to an interview.  In order to preserve 
the integrity of the investigation, officers involved in deadly force incident shall 
not be allowed to discuss the details of the incident with one another until 
after all have been interviewed. 

B. When an officer uses a firearm, the officer will surrender his/her weapon to 
the Homicide Sergeant or designee as evidence after arrival at the 
Department.  The Homicide Unit will replace the weapon with a department-
issued weapon or, if so desired, by another personal weapon that meets 
Department specifications.  The officer‘s normal duty weapon will be returned 
to that officer as soon as practical.  The replacement weapon furnished by the 
Department will be returned to the Homicide Unit when the officer‘s normal 
duty weapon is returned. Involved officers will not leave Department 
Headquarters unarmed. 

C. The officer‘s leather gear and holster will be inspected, photographed and 
may be seized and retained as evidence.  The decision to seize the leather 
gear and/or holster will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the 
circumstances of the case. 

D. Involved officers and witness officers will be photographed in the 
uniform/clothing they were wearing at the time the use of force occurred.  The 

  

uniform/clothing may be seized and retained as evidence.  The decision to 
seize the uniform/clothing will be made on a case-by-case basis based on the 
circumstances of the case. 

E. The family of the officer may be contacted by the officer or, with the 
officer‘s consent, by a representative of the Department.  If officers are 
injured, this representative should offer to transport the family to the hospital 
and contact appropriate support personnel. 

F. When an officer uses deadly force they will be given a minimum of three 
days administrative leave at the discretion of the Chief of Police immediately 
following the incident.  The Chief of Police will give a written directive of when 
the officer will return to work. 

G. Whenever an officer of the Anchorage Police Department uses deadly 
force the officer shall automatically attend a psychological evaluation.  This 
provides the employee the opportunity to consult with a psychological

resistance has ceased, any officer who has used OC spray on a person shall 
maintain close observation and make every reasonable effort to allow the 
subject relief from the discomforts associated with oleoresin capsicum, in 
accordance with Departmentally approved training.  These efforts may 
include, but are not limited to the following:

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against

vehicle by means of an intentional collision under circumstances that create a 
substantial risk of causing extensive property damage and death or serious 
physical injury.  Ramming should be utilized only when deadly force is justified by 
AS 11.81 and Anchorage Police Department Regulations (Vehicular Pursuits 
3.06.015 and Response to Resistance 3.05.025). 

Roadblock:  For the purposes of this procedure, an intentional obstruction of a 
roadway at one or more points for the purpose of monitoring the traffic and/or 
securing that roadway.  

Vehicular Pinning Maneuver:  A Vehicular Pinning Maneuver is an attempt by an 
officer to use a police vehicle to stop or contain a slow moving or stationary 
suspect vehicle under conditions that do not create a substantial risk of causing 
extensive property damage or death or serious physical injury.  A Vehicular 
Pinning Maneuver may or may not involve an intentional collision.   

I. IMPLEMENTING A PERIMETER/ROADBLOCK  

PROCEDURE 

A. Commanders and/or Supervisors.  Upon being notified that a situation 
exists that may require the use of a perimeter or roadblock, Commanders 
and/or Supervisors will:  

1. Determine if the circumstances warrant a perimeter or roadblock. 

2. If so, determine if units will be assigned specific locations or a general 
area. 

3. Assist in securing, if necessary, additional police assets.   

B. Dispatch Center.  Dispatch personnel will keep responding officers 
informed of any additional information that becomes available and will assist 
in coordinating necessary police assets.   

C. Responding Units.  Officers responding to a call requiring a perimeter shall 
notify either dispatch or the investigating officer of their location and intended 
approach into the area.  If the situation is still developing as officers arrive in 
the area, the assigned unit or the first on the scene shall be the investigating 
officer.  Other officers will take up or be assigned, positions that block off 
logical escape routes.   

D. Mobile Units.  After the perimeter is established, the on-scene 
Commander, Supervisor, or investigating officer may assign units to patrol the 
perimeter.  Mobile units should be marked police vehicles.  

E. Perimeter/Roadblock Termination.  A Commander, Supervisor or the 
investigating officer shall terminate the perimeter as soon as possible. 
Perimeter units that have been released shall immediately return to their 

  

designated beat assignments unless assigned other tasks relating to the 
incident at hand.   

II. TYPES OF PERIMETERS, ROADBLOCKS & BLOCKING MANEUVERS  

A. Tight Perimeter.  Tight perimeters are established around specific 
locations, such as the exits to a building or the four corners of a city block.  
Tight perimeters are thrown up around locations that allow not just visual 
observation but also allow officers to strictly control ingress and egress of all 
persons to that location.  Availability of personnel frequently limits the use of 
tight perimeters.   

B. Loose Perimeter.  Loose perimeters can be established around almost any 
location, but generally only allow for visual monitoring of the area. Depending 
on the area, most locations can be the subject of a loose perimeter with as 
few as two officers.   

C. Roadblocks.  Roadblocks can be used to establish choke points on arterial 
streets that do not lend themselves to being strictly contained, but only 
monitored.  They can also be used to completely seal off an area or to direct 
pursuits to a less dangerous and/or more contained area.  Checkpoints may 
be used, when appropriate, to closely monitor all persons and vehicles 
entering or leaving the area of a law enforcement incident.  Roadblocks tend 
to fall into two broad categories:  

1. Line Roadblocks.  Roadblocks set up on major highways and arterials 
that have restricted access.  These are employed both to locate the 
suspect(s) and to discourage the use of that roadway by not allowing the 
suspect(s) to blend into traffic and escape.   

2. Circle Roadblocks. 

a). Structure.  The circle roadblock is constructed of an inner and outer 
perimeter, with the crime scene as the center.  The elapsed time from 
the commission of the incident establishes the size of the perimeters.   

b). Spacing.  Spacing of roadblock units will always be close enough to 
prevent the passage of either vehicles or persons on foot without 
notice by police personnel. 

D. Blocking maneuvers.  When a suspect vehicle is stopped or moving at a 
slow speed, officers may, if reasonably necessary, use their police vehicles to 
block, box-in or pin the suspect vehicle in a reasonable effort to contain the 
suspect and avoid the need for a pursuit.  While this action may involve 
physical contact with the suspect vehicle, caution shall be used that the 
blocking technique does not become a ramming.  (Refer to Anchorage Police 
Department regulations: Vehicular Pursuits 3.06.015 and Response to 
Resistance 3.05.025).   

III. TECHNIQUES FOR PERIMETERS, ROADBLOCKS & BLOCKING 
MANEUVERS  

  

A. Emergency Equipment.  The situation dictates which, if any, emergency 
equipment will be activated.  When police vehicles are used in roadblocks 
however, emergency lights shall be activated.  

B. Positioning of Police Vehicles.   

1. Perimeters.  Police vehicles used in perimeters should be positioned so 
as to allow for the greatest field of vision possible.  

2. Roadblocks.  Police vehicles used as roadblocks should be positioned 
at a 45-degree angle to the flow of traffic, if practical, unless passage of 
traffic is to be prohibited.  The vehicles should also be positioned in such a 
manner as to permit oncoming traffic to safely stop prior to the roadblock. 

3. Blocking Maneuvers.   

a). Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication. b). Ramming a vehicle 
is permitted in those instances where the use of deadly force is 
authorized by law and departmental policy. 

c). Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.  

C. Police Personnel Positioning.  The situation will dictate whether officers 
should remain in or outside of their vehicles.  In all cases, officers shall 
position themselves to be able to observe both oncoming traffic and potential 
escape routes while still affording the officer mobility.  

D. Additional Warning Equipment.  When roadblocks are needed on 
roadways subject to heavy and/or high speed traffic, additional warning 
devices such as barricades, flashers, stop signs, and flares will be positioned 
to both slow and funnel traffic.  The distance ahead of the roadblock should 
be increased proportionately with the speed and volume of the traffic flow.  

E. Strategic Placement.  In some situations it may be advantageous to place 
the roadblocks and warning devices in such a manner that suspect vehicles 
will not have the opportunity to turn around without detection.  Roadblocks of 
this type will still allow enough room prior to the roadblock for all vehicles to 
stop safely (See ―B. Positioning of Police Vehicles‖ above).  

F. Avoiding Accidents.  In all cases, roadblocks will be situated in a manner 
that allows traffic, including high-speed emergency vehicles, sufficient 
distance to react to the roadblock by slowing or stopping.  

G. Documentation.  In all incidents involving the use of a perimeter, 
roadblock, or blocking maneuver where there is any injury to any person or 
property, Municipal or not, a Response to Resistance Packet will be 
completed by the on-scene Commander or Supervisor and forwarded to the 
Chief of Police through the chain of command.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.06.010  Use of Police Vehicles 

To advise all personnel of the proper methods of operating police vehicles. 

Members of the Department use any police vehicle in the safest and most 
effective fashion for delivery of police services. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DEFINITIONS 

Marked Police Vehicle:  For purposes of this procedure, a ―marked unit‖ or 
―marked police vehicle‖ refers to any vehicle displaying regulation police 
department colors and insignia, and equipped with approved emergency warning 
equipment. 

Emergency Warning Equipment:  For purposes of this procedure, emergency 
warning equipment includes at least a flashing red light visible to the front of the 
police vehicle and an audible siren, both meeting State of Alaska requirements. 

Unmarked Police Vehicle:  For purposes of this procedure, any motorized vehicle 
legally applied to police services by an employee of the police department. 

Specialty Vehicles:  For purposes of this procedure, any remaining unit operated 
under the control and responsibility of the police department.  This includes, but 
is not limited to, leased vehicles, Community Services Officers‘ vehicles, vans, 
light and heavy trucks, buses, snow machines, motorcycles, and bicycles. 

I. ROUTINE PATROL 

PROCEDURES 

A. Compliance with Traffic Laws.  Vehicles shall be operated in compliance 
with existing traffic laws when in routine operation. 

B. Parking Compliance.  Vehicles shall be operated in compliance with 
existing parking regulations, except when specifically exempted by ordinance 
or procedure. 

  

1. AMC 9.08.080 allows authorized emergency vehicles responding to an 
emergency to be exempt from the parking ordinances. This exemption 
does not relieve the operator from parking safely. 

2. In instances when a unit is responding to any type of call and receives a 
parking citation, the employee may write the case number and brief 
explanation of the circumstances on the front of the citation and forward it 
to the Traffic Sergeant for review. 

a). If this is not done, or if the Traffic Sergeant denies exemption, the 
employee is responsible for paying the parking ticket and/or impound 
fee. 

3. In all other circumstances, employees shall abide by all parking 
ordinances. 

4. The Anchorage Parking Authority has authorized free parking to all 
police vehicles, regardless of the circumstances, in any of their lots or 
garages.   

5. Prisoner transport parking. 

a). Reserve parking in the Court House parking lot has been allocated 
for the Warrants Section‘s exclusive use. 
b). Reserved parking for patrol vehicles is available on 3rd Ave., K St. 
and I St. These spaces are for on-duty officers transporting prisoners 
or for police vehicles which cannot access the Captain Cook Parking 
Garage. 

II. RESPONSE CODES 

A. Types.  Police vehicles respond to both emergency and non-emergency 
calls for service. The type and manner of response is coded as follows: 

1. Code Two.  A non-emergency response code that instructs the operator 
to proceed directly to the location in question, but to abide by all moving 
traffic laws.  Use of any emergency warning equipment en route is 
inappropriate.  Unless otherwise notified, all responses are presumed to 
be code two.  Emergency warning equipment may be used at a non-
emergency scene, such as at a traffic accident, for visibility.   

2. Code Three.  Emergency assignments where there is actual or threat of 
serious injury or death of a person.  Response shall be with both 
emergency lights and siren in operation to allow all practical haste.   

The driver may reasonably suspend any traffic law, but shall always abide 
by AMC 9.08.080 D, which states that no provision shall relieve the driver 
of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard 
for the safety of all persons, nor shall such provisions protect the driver 
from the consequences of reckless disregard for the safety of others.   

  

Full stops at controlled intersections are required whenever the controlling 
device is red for the emergency vehicle, or otherwise signals traffic to 
stop. 

3. Code Four.  Emergency assignments where the use of the emergency 
warning equipment (especially the siren) may interfere with the effective 
performance of the police task.  Code four allows emergency operation of 
police vehicles, with cause, with less than full use of the emergency 
warning equipment.   

As with code three, traffic laws may be suspended, but in doing so, AMC 
9.08.080 D still applies. 

B. Initiation.  Code three and code four operations can be initiated by 
Dispatch Center, a supervisor, or the operator of the vehicle.  Selection of 
code will be based on this policy: 

Dispatch Center will give the most appropriate code based on their best 
information, but the officer is the final authority of what code to use.  That 
choice must be based on the available facts.  The officer must notify Dispatch 
of any modification to code (up or down), and must be able to articulate the 
reasons. 

C. Termination and Reduction.  ―Running code‖ is one of the most hazardous 
operations in police work. If an officer receives information which changes the 
nature of the emergency response, the officer may reduce or terminate the 
code response.  

This reduction or termination of code response should be based on 
reasonable facts.  Conversely, the officer may elevate the code response 
based on reasonable facts.  If an officer changes the status of their code 
response, they will advise Dispatch and other responding officers so the other 
officers may adjust their response code appropriately.  

D. Non-Sworn Member Codes.  Non-sworn members may operate 
Department vehicles only in the code two mode. 

III. USE OF EMERGENCY WARNING EQUIPMENT 

A. Use.  Emergency equipment shall be used in the following instances, and 
in the following fashion: 

1. Dispatched Emergencies, as follows: 

a). Code Three 

b). Code Four 

2. Escorts, as follows: 

a). Types of Escorts.  For purposes of this procedure, two types of 
escorts are recognized, namely: 

i. Emergency escorts.  When serious injury or death might result in 
delaying the movement of an escorted vehicle. 

  

ii. Non-emergency escorts.  When police escort is provided for 
traffic control, tradition, events, or other non-urgent reasons.  These 
include house moves and other oversized loads, funeral escorts, 
and diplomatic escorts.  Non-emergency escorts shall not be 
conducted unless approved by the Captain of Patrol. 

b). Equipment.  Escorts may be provided only with units having all 
emergency warning devices functional. 

c). Method.  The following methods shall be used: 

i. Emergency escorts shall be conducted under the same provisions 
as discussed in ―Code Three‖ operations. 

ii. Non-emergency escorts are to be conducted as instructed by the 
field supervisor or Commander. 

d). Limitations to Emergency Escorts.  In lieu of escorting a non-
emergency vehicle under emergency conditions, officers will transport 
in their vehicle, or will arrange for transport in an appropriate 
emergency vehicle whenever practical. 

3. Traffic stops.  Emergency equipment serves the purposes of: 

a). Alerting the operator to stop the vehicle; and/or 

b). Making the stopped vehicles more visible, reducing the likelihood of 
an accident; and/or 

c). Making the scene of the stop more easily found by other units, 
should assistance be necessary. 

4. Other events that require: 

a). The legitimate suspension of compliance with traffic laws; and/or 

b). Enhanced visibility; and/or 

c). Alerting other(s) to stop or yield. 

B. Exceptions.  Nothing in this procedure precludes officers from exceeding 
the speed limit a reasonable amount without activating the emergency 
equipment to ―clock‖ a speeding vehicle. 

IV. SPECIALTY VEHICLES 

A. In General.  The Anchorage Police Department uses various types and 
classes of specialty vehicles in its law enforcement and public service 
mission.  

Specialty vehicles may be employed where their unique attributes enhance a 
police function or make possible an operation‘s successful completion.  
Specialty vehicles may be marked or unmarked units. 

B. Application of Specialty Vehicle Equipment.  The use of any specialty 
vehicle shall be at the authority of the appropriate unit or shift commander, 
except that:  

  

1. All operations of any specialty vehicle shall be in a manner not creating 
undue hazard to the public, to property, or to the operator, and not 
creating unwarranted disturbance to the public or to the environment. 

2. Specialty vehicles will not be assigned or used as take-home vehicles.  
During specialty vehicle use, assigned take-home vehicles will be parked 
in an appropriate manner in the APD parking area or they may be legally 
parked near the designated or storage area for the specialty vehicle, so 
long as they do not interfere with any other Division or Section‘s parking or 
operation. 

3.  Specialty vehicles will be secured at the end of each tour of duty in the 
location approved for them, and shall be made ready for the next duty tour 
before being so secured.  Operators shall ensure that the specialty vehicle 
is serviced, if necessary, prior to securing it for the next use. 

C. Motorized specialty vehicles. 

1. Motorized specialty vehicles, including motorcycles, snowmachines, 
certain trucks, and buses, require additional skills, training, and/or 
licensing to be operated safely and legally. 

a). Only personnel who have successfully completed a departmentally-
approved course for the specific motorized specialty vehicle type, and 
are properly licensed by the State of Alaska for that vehicle class, are 
authorized to operate such vehicles. 

2. Operators of motorized specialty vehicles shall not be dispatched as the 
initial responding vehicle on any call for service, including traffic accidents, 
and will not be dispatched ―Code 3.‖  Motorized specialty vehicles shall not 
initiate or become actively involved in any vehicular pursuit. 

a). Operators of motorized specialty vehicles not equipped as ―marked 
police vehicles‖ as defined in this procedure may respond to urgent 
calls for service within reason, at the discretion of the operator within 
the guidelines of current general operating procedure and any 
operating procedures of the unit to which they are assigned, and ―Code 
2‖ only is permitted. 

b). Operators of those single-purpose police motorcycles assigned to 
the Traffic Motorcycle Unit and equipped as ―marked police vehicles‖ 
as defined in this procedure may respond to urgent calls for service, 
and may respond to calls ―Code 3‖ at the discretion of the operator, 
within the guidelines of current general operating procedure and any 
operating procedures of the unit to which they are assigned. 

c). Operators of specialty vehicles may be authorized to wear 
appropriate uniforms or equipment during their tours of duty.  Should it 
become necessary to return to a standard marked or unmarked police 
vehicle during that tour, the operator will not normally be required to 
change uniforms or equipment. 

  

V. ―HOME CAR‖ SPECIAL PROCEDURES 

A. Purpose.  The fundamental purpose of the ―home car‖ program is to 
provide the community with substantially expanded police availability at little 
additional expense by: 

1. Increased police presence.  Off-duty officers in marked units contribute 
to police ―omnipresence.‖ 

2. Quicker response time.  More units, randomly located, give potentially 
shorter response times to emergency situations--again, at reduced costs. 

3. Better police access.  Should a citizen need non-emergency services, 
an off-duty officer can more quickly assess the services sought and link 
that person with the appropriate facilities. 

4. More efficient use of equipment.  Experience has shown that fleet 
vehicles get less attention than assigned ones, so the cost of vehicle 
operations decreases and the expected vehicle lifetime increases. 

B. Duties of the Department.  The Department‘s duties in the program 
include: 

1. Administering the program by making vehicle assignments, compiling 
statistics, monitoring usage, promulgating regulations, and similar duties. 

2. Home car assignments will be based upon proper fleet management 
principles.  A recruit will not be allowed to take their car home until they 
have completed their Field Training Observation (FTO) Period. 

3. Furnishing gasoline, oil, maintenance, and insurance for the vehicles. 

C. Duties of the Assigned Officers.  Officers assigned a ―home car‖ shall: 

1. Comply with directed administrative tasks, including: 

a). Participating in any assigned program or equipment evaluations. 

b). Ensuring maintenance schedules are met.  

c). Operators shall check the home car engine oil, coolant/water every 
time they refuel their vehicle.  

d). Operators are to make sure they arrange their home car 
maintenance service as required and posted by the light duty shop. 
These maintenance requirements include, but are not limited to fleet 
cars, motorcycles, snow machines, and any other vehicle assigned to 
that employee.    

2. Operate the vehicle in compliance with all laws, Department regulations 
and the Collective Bargaining Agreement.  This includes, but is not limited 
to: 

a). Proper use of seat belts and child restraints. 

b). Remaining within the Anchorage Police Service Area, when off 
duty. 

  

c). Adherence to specific regulations regarding use of Home Cars by 
officers on light duty status. 

3. Conform to the following general regulations: 

a). Not allow any non-employees to operate the vehicle except upon 
authorization of a Command Officer. 

b). When parking a marked unit at the assigned officer‘s residence, 
position that vehicle for maximum visibility by the public.  

c). Ensure the vehicle is clean, both inside and out. 

d). Do not alter the vehicle, except as authorized by the Department, 
including the application/display of logos, advertising, or political 
messages or statements on either the interior or exterior of the vehicle. 

e). Vehicles shall be locked during all unattended periods. 

f). No equipment shall left in an unsecured, unattended vehicle.  No 
weapons shall be left unsecured in any vehicle at any time.  No 
equipment or property shall be left in any vehicle left unattended for 
protracted periods of time, or when that vehicle will be accessed by 
non-Department personnel. 

g). Vehicles shall be stored at a location designated by the Department 
when the assigned officer is to be off of work for extended periods of 
time. 

h). Vehicles shall never be operated in such a fashion, nor taken to 
such a location, as to bring embarrassment or discredit to the 
Department.  Although non-police personnel may accompany officers 
as passengers when the vehicle is operated off duty, that officer is 
responsible for the appearance and conduct of those passengers. 

I). Vehicles shall not be operated: 

i. With the odor of alcohol on the operator‘s breath; or 

ii. While impaired, however slightly, by any substance: or 

iii. With any physical or mental/emotional condition that manifestly 
impairs the operator‘s reaction or judgment. (See 1.02.015G and 
1.02.015H) 

j). No dogs shall be allowed inside police vehicles, whether on or off 
duty, unless they are certified Police Canines or Police Canines-in-
training in a departmentally approved training program.  However, this 
does not prevent officers from providing normal police services that 
may involve transporting animals. 

4. Monitor the police radio at all times. 

5. Respond for police services when appropriate.  When responding: 

  

a). Discharge all non-police personnel prior to responding to any 
potentially dangerous situations. 

b). Take appropriate action on any police service situation.  This can 
range from calling an on-duty unit to full police action by the off-duty 
officer. See ―Arrests—General. 

i. Any paperwork generated shall be turned in to the Department as 
expeditiously as possible. 

ii. No off-duty officer shall be dispatched to anything other than an 
emergency situation. 

6. Actively enforce observed traffic violations. 

 

VI. RELATED TOPICS 

A. Use of Privately Owned Vehicles.  The use of privately owned vehicles for 
police application shall only be conducted with prior approval of the Division 
Commander. 

B. Off-Roadway Use of Police Vehicles.  No police vehicle shall be operated 
off the normally traveled portion of a roadway unless one of the following 
conditions is met: 

1. The vehicle is specifically designed for off-roadway application; or 

2. There is an emergency so urgent as to justify the possible damage and 
injury this type of operation may cause, and the officer can articulate that 
urgency. 

C. Accidents Involving Police Vehicles.  Whenever a marked or unmarked 
police vehicle is involved in an accident, whether there is visible damage or 
not, a supervisor must be notified before any vehicle involved leaves the 
scene.

3.06.015  Vehicular Pursuits 

To advise all sworn personnel of the policies governing vehicular pursuits. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

There is no set formula to cover all pursuit situations because of the variables 
and complexities involved.  Decisions about pursuits must be based on sound 
judgment, the law, training, experience and this policy.   

It is the policy of the Anchorage Police Department that officers must discontinue 
their involvement in motor vehicle pursuits at any time the pursuit itself becomes 
a greater threat to life or property than the threat which the officer reasonably 
believes the suspect poses.   

Officers must continuously evaluate the necessity of immediate apprehension 
against the level of danger created by the pursuit, as those risks may change 
over the course of the pursuit.   

Officers and Supervisors shall be held accountable for their actions in a pursuit 
and must be able to clearly articulate the reasons for initiating and continuing a 
pursuit.  

DEFINITIONS 

Pursuit:  For purposes of this procedure, a pursuit is an active attempt by one or 
more police officers to apprehend a suspect who is attempting to avoid capture 
by evasively operating a motor vehicle.  Pursuits do not include code runs or 
closing the distance with violators prior to making a traffic stop. 

Primary Pursuing Unit:  The police officer who initiates a pursuit or any unit that 
assumes the lead in a pursuit. 

Secondary/Tertiary Pursuing Units:  Any unit directly assisting the primary 
pursuing unit, not a Commander or Supervisor.   

  

Commander/Supervisor:  For the purposes of this procedure, these terms are 
synonymous, unless otherwise noted.

AMC 9.08.080   Authorized emergency vehicles. 

13 AAC 02.517 Authorized and other emergency vehicles.  

PROCEDURE 

I. DRIVER AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY 

A. Municipal Code.  Section 9.08.080 of the Anchorage Municipal Code 
specifies that when responding to an emergency call, or when pursuing an 
actual or suspected violator, authorized emergency vehicle drivers are 
exempt from certain rules of the road, provided the visual and audible signals 
on such vehicles are operating ( See exception in paragraph IV. F of this 
Procedure).  This does not relieve the driver of the duty to drive with due 
regard for safety, nor does it protect the driver from all consequences of 
recklessly disregarding the safety of others. 

B. State Code.  13 AAC 02.517 is essentially the State equivalent of the 
Municipal Code.  It does not relieve the driver of the duty to drive with due 
regard for safety, nor does it protect the driver from all consequences of 
recklessly disregarding the safety of others. 

C. Duty to Discontinue.  Any time a sworn officer determines the pursuit 
causes an unreasonable danger to pursuing officers or the public, that officer 
shall immediately identify him/herself and order the pursuit discontinued.  This 
allows even the most junior officers to terminate a pursuit initiated by the most 
senior commanders if they realize and relate that the pursuit causes a clear 
danger (See section VII.A for clarification of Unreasonable Danger). 

II. DISPATCH CENTER RESPONSIBILITY 

A. Communications personnel shall immediately: 

1. Notify any available supervisor of the pursuit; 

2. Clear the radio channel on non-emergency traffic; and 

3. Relay necessary information to other officers. 

B. Contact any other departments/agencies/jurisdictions as appropriate. 

C. Determine the name and address of the owner of the pursued vehicle; and 

D. If the owner is within the jurisdiction of the Anchorage Police Department 
dispatch any available officers to that address to either intercept the vehicle or 
determine who is operating the vehicle. 

E. At the conclusion of the pursuit the dispatch supervisor will: 

  

1. Ensure that a copy of the pursuit radio traffic along with any associated 
printouts is made and; 

2. Send an e-mail notification of the pursuit and the availability of these 
materials to Internal Affairs to begin the review process (See I-4 of this 
procedure). 

III. SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY 

A. General.  The Supervisor will immediately gather as much information as 
practical and shall assume responsibility for the pursuit.  The Supervisor is 
also charged with ensuring the reason for initiating the pursuit is clearly 
communicated by the pursuing officers.  If this information is not clearly 
broadcast by police radio, the supervisor shall immediately order that the 
pursuit be discontinued.  

The supervisor‘s foremost considerations shall be officer and public safety, 
methods of identifying the fleeing suspect, tactics to stop the fleeing vehicle, 
and the coordination of officers involved in the pursuit.  The supervisor will 
continually monitor and assess the situation.   

B. Supervisor as Primary Unit.  In the event a supervisor initiates a pursuit, he 
or she should relinquish the primary position as soon as another unit 
becomes available to take over this role.  The supervisor will then assume 
responsibility for the pursuit as outlined above.   

IV. INITIATING/CONTINUING A VEHICULAR PURSUIT 

A. General.  Pursuits should be limited to those situations and conditions 
outlined in the Pursuit Decision Matrix that permit initiating a pursuit.  The 
decision to continue to pursue must be evaluated constantly.  At any time the 
pursuit becomes a greater threat to life or property than the threat which the 
officers reasonably believe the suspect poses, the pursuit must be 
discontinued.   

Experience has shown us that the longer a pursuit is allowed to continue, the 
greater the potential for disaster.  For example, with the passage of time, 
more and more citizens may be exposed to risk as the suspect drives 
recklessly down city streets.  With the passage of time the suspect may move 
from a low density area into a high density neighborhood.  It is therefore in the 
best interests of public safety to terminate a pursuit as quickly as possible, 
either through decisive action to stop the suspect (See 
Perimeters/Roadblocks/Blocking Maneuvers 3.06.005) or through a rapid 
assessment of the totality of circumstances and discontinuing the pursuit. 

A person whose identity is known, who has not been involved in a violent 
felony, and who can be apprehended at a future time generally should not be 
the subject of a pursuit.  

An officer shall not become involved in any pursuit when transporting a 
prisoner or any other passenger.  This does not apply to department 
authorized ride-alongs.  Should an officer with a ride-along initiate a pursuit or 

  

take the secondary pursuing unit role, that officer should relinquish those 
positions as soon as possible.   

B. INTOXICATED DRIVERS 

1. Special Concerns. Intoxicated driver(s) frequently present a difficult 
dilemma to law enforcement in that the crime committed is, initially, a 
misdemeanor or a traffic infraction, but has the potential to cause serious 
physical injury or death if allowed to continue to operate a motor vehicle. 
Frequently, the manner of driving by these offenders is already dangerous 
to the public prior to officers attempting to stop them. Consequently, 
supervisors will have the discretion to authorize a moderate risk pursuit of 
a suspected OUI offender, even though this may only be a misdemeanor.  
It is incumbent on the authorizing supervisor to weigh these facts in 
determining whether the circumstances warrant this belief. 

2. Criteria for Pursuit or Termination 

a). Any officer attempting to stop a suspected OUI violator, and that 
driver refuses to comply with the directive to stop, the officer must 
immediately notify and articulate to an authorizing supervisor the 
reasons for the attempted stop (see Considerations under sub 
paragraph C, below) and any other pertinent information that leads the 
officer to believe that the driver on the motor vehicle is OUI. 

b). If a suspected intoxicated driver was driving aggressively, at 
excessively high speeds, or otherwise posing a significant, immediate 
threat to public safety before an officer tried to stop the suspect, an 
officer should attempt to apprehend that suspect as quickly and safely 
as possible within the guidelines of the law and this policy. 

C. Considerations.  The pursuing officers and supervisor assuming 
responsibility for the pursuit shall consider the following factors in determining 
whether to initiate or continue a pursuit: 

1. Nature and seriousness of the offense.  

2. Time of day 

3. Weather conditions 

4. Road conditions 

5. Traffic conditions 

6. Population Density/Pedestrian Traffic 

7. Familiarity with the area 

8. Schools/Parks 

9. Vehicle capabilities 

10. Visibility and illumination 

11. Possibility of identification and apprehension at a later time 

  

12. Speed involved 

13. Driving skills of the pursuing officer 

14. Suspect exhibits signs of impairment, i.e., erratic driving behaviors 
(weaving, no headlights, wrong way on a one way, etc.). 

15. Information from sources (other than police) that the driver is impaired 
(store clerk, concerned family member, citizen report, etc.). 

16. Type of vehicle being pursued. 

D. Using Emergency Equipment.  In order to diminish the likelihood of a 
pursuit, officers intending to stop vehicles shall be within close proximity to 
the vehicle being stopped before activating emergency lights/siren and 
attempting the stop (See Use of Police Vehicles 3.06.010).   

Operating a police vehicle at high speeds in order to apprehend a traffic 
violator may not constitute a vehicular pursuit per se, provided the violator 
has not exhibited intent to flee and is apprehended within a short distance. 

While similar instances are not pursuits, they do require the same degree of 
responsible vehicle operation as specified in this procedure. 

1. When vehicular pursuits are initiated, regardless of the reason, officers 
must employ emergency lights and siren for the duration of the pursuit. 

E. Police Vehicles Without Emergency Equipment.  Police vehicles without 
functional emergency lights and siren will neither initiate nor join in a vehicular 
pursuit. 

F. Unmarked Vehicles.  Officers in unmarked vehicles equipped with 
emergency lights and siren may find it necessary to pursue a suspect.  This 
will continue only so long as it takes marked units to assist.  Once marked 
units have taken over as primary and secondary units, the unmarked unit will 
immediately and completely disengage.  Unmarked units are permitted to 
respond to the location or area of the termination point in order to assist with 
a perimeter or possibly identification of a suspect.   

G. Sport Utility or Other Specialty Vehicles.  This policy recognizes that there 
are a number of unmarked, soft marked and marked specialty vehicles 
currently in use.  Officers must take care when determining what vehicles are 
best suited for a particular set of circumstances and environmental conditions.  
For example:  There may be cases where a 4x4 Marked SUV would (or would 
not) be a better pursuit vehicle than a sedan.  Therefore, it may be 
reasonable for a primary pursuit vehicle to be replaced by a different, better 
suited vehicle.   

H. Police Motorcycle Units.  Officers assigned to a motorcycle unit have some 
very unique risk factors to consider when deciding whether or not to initiate or 
continue a vehicular pursuit.  Motorcycle units are permitted to initiate a 
pursuit, taking into consideration the associated risk factors.  They are only to 
remain involved in the pursuit as long as is necessary to have a marked or 

  

unmarked vehicle take over as the primary unit.  Once a marked or unmarked 
unit has taken over as a primary unit, the motorcycle unit will immediately 
disengage from the actual pursuit.  Motorcycle units are permitted to assist 
with other aspects of the pursuit at the termination point such as pursuing a 
subject who flees on foot or assisting with identification of a suspect.  If there 
is no immediate response from a marked or unmarked vehicle, motorcycle 
units shall continue only as long as is reasonably safe given the current set of 
risk factors. 

V. OPERATIONALLY SENSITIVE/NOT FOR PUBLICATION.  

V. CONTROLLING THE PURSUIT 

A. Number of Participating Units.   

1. Only the primary and secondary units shall pursue the suspect vehicle 
―Code 3‖.  Other units shall remain alert to the pursuit‘s progress and 
direction and assist as the situation demands.  

2. Officers in the primary pursuing unit may request additional units to join 
the pursuit if it appears reasonably certain that officers in the primary and 
secondary pursuing units will not be sufficient to safely affect the arrest of 
the suspect(s). 

B. Primary Unit Responsibilities.  The first responsibility of officers in the 
primary pursuing unit is public safety.  In rare cases this may demand the 
immediate apprehension of a suspect, or more often, it may require a 
decision not to pursue.  If a pursuit is initiated, primary pursuing unit officers 
shall be responsible for controlling the pursuit tactics unless relieved by an 
on-scene supervisor.  The primary unit is also charged with: 

1. Immediately communicating the reason for initiating the pursuit.  Failure 
to clearly articulate the reason for the pursuit may result in an immediate 
decision by a field supervisor to order the pursuit terminated. 

2. Broadcasting the following information: 

a). Location, speed, and direction of travel 

b). Description and license plate number, if known; and 

c). Number and description of occupants, where possible 

d). Any other important information about the suspect vehicle or 
environment (i.e. suspect is traveling without lights) 

C. Secondary/Tertiary Pursuing Unit Responsibilities. 

1. The secondary unit and tertiary units, upon joining the pursuit, will 
advise the primary unit of their presence.  The secondary unit will take 
over radio communications, immediately notifying Dispatch Center that 
there are three units involved.  The tertiary unit will trail behind the first two 
units and be prepared to move up if one of the other units has to drop out, 
or to assist in the capture should a PIT maneuver be utilized.  No 

  

additional units shall join the pursuit unless specifically requested by the 
primary unit or the supervisor. 

2. The secondary unit responsibilities also include making the decision to 
discontinue the pursuit at any time.   

3. The secondary pursuing unit shall assume the duties of the primary 
pursuing unit should the primary pursuing unit be unable to continue. 

D. Other Assisting Units.  Other units in the general vicinity not directly 
involved in primary pursuit may proceed with caution to positions that would 
assist in perimeter support.  Officers equipped with tire deflation devices (i.e. 
Spike Strips or Stingers) should position themselves ahead of the pursuit in 
order to assist in bringing the suspect vehicle to a controlled stop (Refer to 
Tire Deflation Devices 3.10.080 and Perimeters/Roadblocks/PIT/Blocking 
Maneuvers 3.06.005). 

E. Passing During a Pursuit.  Passing a pursuing unit is inherently dangerous 
and shall be limited to those circumstances where no other reasonable 
alternative is available.  In all instances the unit that is passing another 
pursuing unit must clearly communicate and coordinate the maneuver before 
attempting to pass.  Examples of instances that can reasonably be 
contemplated as necessitating passing during a pursuit include those which 
require the primary pursuing unit to relinquish this role to another police 
vehicle (i.e. a supervisor or unmarked vehicle in primary pursuit), or out of 
tactical necessity. 

F. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.   

G. Pursuits that continue outside the service area of the Anchorage Police 
Department.  Officers are permitted to continue a pursuit that began in our 
service area, taking into consideration a multitude of circumstances that 
create additional risk factors to include; loss of or poor radio communication, 
poor orientation knowledge, and lack of available support personnel.  The 
monitoring supervisor shall ensure that contact has been made with the law 
enforcement agency that provides service to the area that is being entered.  
Once that agency has been notified and becomes involved, it is 
recommended that they take over as the primary unit.  With supervisory 
approval, Anchorage Police Department units will remain involved in a 
support function.   

VI. PURSUITS INITIATED BY OUTSIDE AGENCIES 
When a pursuit is initiated by another law enforcement agency, the initiating unit 
and agency shall be responsible for the progress of the pursuit.  Units of the 
Anchorage Police Department shall not join in a pursuit unless specifically 
requested to do so by the pursuing agency when they are pursuing a dangerous 
suspect, or unless it is clearly demonstrated that a lone unit from an outside 
agency is unable to request our assistance and the tactical situation 
demonstrates the need for our assistance.  If a member of the Anchorage Police 

  

Department joins in or assumes responsibility for an outside agency‘s pursuit, all 
of the procedures established in this policy shall apply.   

VII. DISCONTINUING THE PURSUIT 
Officers involved in a pursuit must continually question the wisdom of continuing.  
Additional offenses committed by the suspect during the course of the pursuit 
may escalate the seriousness of the crime(s), but this does not lessen the 
responsibility of officers to break off the pursuit in the interest of public safety.  
Officers must be certain that when the pursuit was initiated it was authorized by 
this policy.  Acts by the suspect during the pursuit can not elevate the need to 
pursue if the original pursuit was not authorized by policy.  Officers will not be 
subjected to any disciplinary action for discontinuing a pursuit, but will be held 
fully accountable for remaining in a pursuit that reasonably should have been 
discontinued.   

A. Unreasonable Danger.  A pursuit will be discontinued when there is an 
unreasonable danger to the public or pursuing officers.  An unreasonable 
danger includes continuing the pursuit beyond what is reasonable and 
prudent for existing vehicle, road and other adverse environmental conditions 
balanced against the immediate need to apprehend the suspect (as illustrated 
by the Pursuit Decision Matrix).   

B. Discontinuation.  When a pursuit is discontinued the pursuing units shall: 

1. Clearly identify themselves over the radio and inform dispatch to advise 
other units of the discontinuation. 

2. Turn off all emergency gear, turn off of the road, make the next 
available turn or pull over and stop.  Make no attempt to follow the 
suspect.   

3. Obey all traffic laws. 

4. Officers shall not take any proactive steps to visually track or position 
themselves in a location where the suspect is likely to pass. 

5. Clearly state the factors leading to the discontinuation in the police 
report.  

6. This policy recognizes the value of officers determining the likely 
location the suspect may return to and then going to that location in order 
to continue the criminal investigation.  Officer shall wait a reasonable 
period of time after discontinuing the pursuit, giving time for the suspect to 
exit the vehicle before exercising this option in an effort to minimize the 
likelihood of re-engaging the suspect in another pursuit.  If possible, 
officers should consult with a field supervisor prior to attempting to locate 
the suspect after a pursuit has been discontinued. 

NOTE:  There may be circumstances where a pursuit has been 
discontinued and then the suspects actions bring them back into contact 
with officers.  In these cases, officers are to re-assess the risk factors and, 
if possible, consult with field supervisors before attempting to stop the 

  

suspect.  In essence, officers are to consider the subsequent event as an 
entirely separate decision and weigh the risk factors accordingly with the 
additional knowledge that this suspect has demonstrated a propensity to 
flee, thus increasing the risk.  Officers shall not use the previously 
discontinued pursuit as the only reason to attempt another stop of the 
suspect, particularly if the previous eluding was based on a stop for an 
infraction or violation.  

7. Tire deflation devices will not be deployed in an attempt to stop a 
vehicle, if the pursuit of that vehicle has been discontinued. 

VIII. RESPONSIBILITIES AT THE TERMINATION OF PURSUIT 

Vehicular pursuits evoke strong emotional and physical responses that do not 
immediately dissipate when the chase is over.  The intensity of the pursuit and 
determination to apprehend are still with officers when they contact the suspect.  
Officers are nonetheless required to maintain self-control and strict personal 
discipline, and only use that level of control reasonably necessary to affect an 
arrest or maintain custody.  Once the pursuit has ended, time is on our side and 
officers should seek ways of slowing the situation down and affecting a safe 
arrest.  Unless the situation dictates otherwise, at the conclusion of the pursuit 
officers should treat the incident as a felony stop. 

A. Pursuing Officers.   

1. The primary pursuing unit is to maintain control and direct activities at 
the termination point, unless relived by a Supervisor. 

2. The secondary pursuing unit shall be responsible for assisting the 
primary unit.   

B. Non-pursuing Officers.  Unless otherwise directed to the scene, all other 
officers shall remain clear. 

C. Supervisors. 

1. If a Supervisor has not responded to a pursuit, the pursuing officers or 
the Dispatch Center will request a Supervisor to respond.  The Supervisor 
is responsible for controlling police action at the scene and ensuring 
adherence to Department policies.   

2. Supervisors shall initiate or assign, as appropriate, any adjunct or 
follow-up reports rising from incidents generated during the pursuit.  
Supervisors at the shift level are responsible for entering the pursuit into 
the current internal affairs tracking system. 

D. Internal Affairs. 

1. Internal Affairs will review each pursuit to determine if: 

a). the pursuit and subsequent actions were within Departmental policy 

b). there are training needs to be considered 

c). any policy changes need to be considered and 

  

d). to statistically document the incident. 

2. A report of findings will be prepared for command review.

3.06.020 Ride-along Program 
 

PURPOSE 
 
To establish guidelines for the transportation of persons other than police officers 
or prisoners who may be permitted to ride as passengers in on-duty police 
vehicles. 
 

POLICY 
 

It is the policy of the Anchorage Police Department through its Ride-Along 
Program to allow citizens to accompany a police officer as an observer in a 
police vehicle. The assignments and activities of citizens authorized to participate 
in this program will be limited to and conform to the conditions and regulations 
set forth in this procedure. 
 

DISCUSSION 
 
The Anchorage Police Department recognizes the value of allowing citizens, non-
sworn municipal employees, and others the opportunity to familiarize themselves 
with the day-to-day operations and complexities of police work. The ultimate goal 
of this program is to educate the public and to develop a sense of mutual respect 
and understanding between police and citizens in the community.  In general, 
citizens at least 18 years of age who do not have criminal history would be 
authorized to participate in the program. 
 

PROCEDURES 

A. Before a citizen will be authorized to participate in the ride-along program 
a criminal background check must be conducted.  At a minimum APSIN, 
NCIC, and Tiburon will be checked.  Areas of concern might include 
Tiburon history of mental health issues. If there are additional concerns 
Courtview and or IAPro databases can also be checked. There will be no 
exceptions to this rule. Background checks may be conducted by Public 

 

 

  

Affairs, Patrol, Dispatch, or any other APD entity authorized to use these 
systems.  

1.  The Commander of Public Affairs will insure all Citizen Academy 
and other citizen requests to participate in the program have a 
background check. 

2.  The Patrol Shift Commander or designee will insure all other citizen 
riders have a criminal background check completed prior to riding. 

3.  Typically any criminal conviction will disqualify a citizen from 
participating in the program.  Exceptions can be made with 
approval of the Captain of Patrol. 

4.  The Shift Commander has the final authority to approve or 

disapprove a rider based upon operational or other considerations. 

 
B. Shift Sergeants will make ride along assignments based on operational 
and staffing considerations.  These assignments will not be made in the 
presence of the rider. 

 
C. Prior to any ride-along, officers shall ensure the rider has read and signed 
the APD Release of Liability Form.  The original signed copy is delivered 
to a shift sergeant who will provide it to the shift commander for approval.  
The signed and initialed forms will be provided to Internal Affairs for 
retention.  In addition, officers will be familiar with and enforce the 
instructions outlined on the Ride-along Release of Liability form. 

 
D. Officers assigned a civilian rider will notify Dispatch at the start of their 

shift of the presence of a civilian rider. Otherwise, they are responsible for 
responding to calls and performing their duties as normal. 

 
E. Officers shall ensure that each civilian rider wears a ballistic vest and that 

it fits the individual appropriately. 

F.  Officers may familiarize the rider with certain equipment in the patrol 

vehicle and how it functions (e.g., the police radio). 

G. Officers are expected to be cordial and answer the rider‘s questions, but 

shall not disclose confidential, tactical, or operational information.  
Pursuit of a personal relationship during the ride-along is prohibited.  

 
H. When appropriate, officers should introduce their rider to the public as a 

civilian observer. 

I.  Should it be necessary to stop at a substation or any other location where 
the rider will be alone with the officer, officers shall notify Dispatch via the 
radio upon arrival and again upon departure. Any unscheduled tours of the 

 

 

 

  

training center or other locations will be cleared through the sector 
sergeant. 

J.  Officers shall not allow riders to enter felony crime scenes before they are 
processed for evidence or where the suspect is still present; nor shall they 
observe formal, recorded interviews in sensitive cases.  

K. When responding to calls, officer shall weigh situations for potential 

hazards. Riders shall not be exposed to situations that pose extraordinary 
danger or extreme hazards. In those cases, riders shall be let out of the 
vehicle a safe distance from the scene or shall be told to remain in the 
patrol vehicle if it is safely parked near the scene. 

L.  In those cases where a rider must be discharged from the vehicle for 
safety purposes, the officer shall immediately notify Dispatch of the 
location where the rider was left.  Every effort must be made to leave the 
citizen in as safe a location as practical; the officer shall retrieve the rider 
or arrange for the rider to be retrieved by another. 

M. Should an officer with a rider initiate a pursuit or take the secondary 

pursuing unit role, that officer should relinquish those positions as soon as 
possible. (See Vehicular Pursuits 3.06.015 IV.A.) 

N. Should a rider request to end the ride-along, they should be returned to 

headquarters or the point of departure as soon as practical. 

O. With the approval of the shift supervisor, officers may end the ride-along if  
(1) the rider does not follow the rules of the program, or creates conflict or 
unsafe conditions for the officer  (2) conditions exist that make it unsafe or 
inappropriate for the ride-along to continue; or, (3) the officer discovers 
something that would have precluded the rider from participating in the 
program. 

P. At all times, officers with passengers will conduct themselves in a 

professional manner consistent with the tenets outlined in the Anchorage 
Police Department‘s policies.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.07.000  Media Relations 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

To advise all personnel of the Department policy concerning relations with the 
media. 

All APD Personnel shall treat the representatives of the media respectfully 
recognizing that a free press is integral to our system of governance and 
guaranteed by the United States Constitution and the Constitution of the State of 
Alaska.   

It is the policy of Anchorage Police Department to deal with all news sources 
equally and without preference.  Department personnel shall make every 
reasonable effort to accommodate newsgathering by members of the media to 
the extent that it does not significantly detract from other departmental duties, 
jeopardize criminal investigations or compromise the safety of the public or 
department personnel. 

Personnel shall coordinate media requests with the APD Public Information 
Office.  

3.07.005  News Releases 

PURPOSE 

To advise all personnel of the procedure for releasing information to the public 
and the news media.  Released information will be restricted to that information 
which is authorized by this procedure and applicable Municipal ordinances and 
State statutes. 

This procedure establishes Press Release Guidelines which enable the police 
department to project a unified image to the public by issuing only one response. 

POLICY 

  

Members of the Anchorage Police Department are encouraged to talk to the 
media and it is, in fact, a job requirement to do so within the published guidelines.  
It is the responsibility of the Public Information and Community Relations Unit 
(PICRU) to retain documented information which is released to the public by 
either that Unit or any member of the Anchorage Police Department.  The Public 
Information and Community Relations Unit will be apprised either verbally or in 
writing of the contents of any press releases so that those same facts may be 
given to other inquiring news agencies, thus insuring there will be only one 
Department response.  Interviews between individual reporters and officers are 
not considered ―releases‖ as referenced in this procedure. 

All facts pertaining to criminal activities, traffic and other information of general 
nature will be released under the name of the Anchorage Police Department. 

All policy matter releases and information pertaining to the Department, except 
general routine matters, will be released over the name of the Chief of Police. 

Personal interviews or presentations may be given by any employee with the 
permission of their supervisor. Such interviews or presentations will conform to 
appropriate laws and policies, and will be only factual information and not 
personal opinion. 

Telephone requests regarding police responses will be honored by the Public 
Information and Community Relations Unit, the supervisor or commander of the 
appropriate unit, or their designee if: 

A report has been filed on the information requested, or 

The information requested involved a major incident of the type that would  
warrant a Public Information and Community Relations Unit representative at 
the scene, or 

The responding officers have cleared the scene, and have time to relay the 
information to the Unit supervisor or commander, designee, or a member of 
the Public Information and Community Relations Unit. 

If a request is received on a controversial issue or any other issue which has not 
been directly addressed in this procedure, the matter will be referred to the 
appropriate unit supervisor/commander or Public Information and Community 
Relations Unit representative.

II. JUVENILES 

A. The Department is held to exceedingly high standards mandating we 
protect the identity of juveniles.  The following policy is established pursuant 
to and in accordance with: 

1. AS 40.25.120 (2)  prohibits the inspection of records pertaining to 
matters involving juveniles. 

2. AS 47.12.300 (c)   prohibits the release of the name or picture of a 
minor under the jurisdiction of the court in connection with the minor's 
status as a delinquent unless authorized by order of the court. (See 
exceptions under AS 47.12.310.) 

 3. AS 47.10.093 prohibits the disclosure of information without permission 
of the court about a child who is subject to a Child in Need of Aid (CINA) 
action. (See exceptions in AS 47.10.093 (b)). 

4. Anchorage Municipal Code (Chapter 3.90) grants freedom of 
information to the public and restricts the release of some types of 
information from police investigation files. 

B. Information which may be released in non-criminal incidents involving 
juveniles, such as missing persons or public assists, includes: 

1. Location and time of occurrence 

2. Name, age, and description of the juvenile 

3, Circumstances surrounding the incident 

4. Photograph of the juvenile victim 

5. Hospital where injured was transported and treated 

C. In non-criminal accidents, the same procedure as cited below would apply 
to juveniles as well as adults. 

III. DEATH INVESTIGATIONS   

  

A. Information regarding the circumstances surrounding any death 
investigation, regardless whether it resulted from criminal, traffic or industrial 
accident, natural or suicide shall be released with the following restrictions: 

1. The deceased‘s name may be released only after it is clearly 
established that the next of kin has been notified.  A call to the assigned 
detective, unit supervisor or commander, mortuary, or medical examiner 
will confirm this notification. 

2. General comments on circumstances, such as apparent wounds and 
method of injury, may be released, but only in nonspecific terms.  The 
specific cause of death will be determined by the pathologist‘s or medical 
examiner‘s office. 

3. When the manner and cause of death are determined by the medical 
examiner, those may be released in homicide or traffic fatality cases with 
the permission of the case detective or unit supervisor or commander.   

IV. TRAFFIC COLLISIONS 

A.  The following guidelines will be used when releasing information about all 
accident investigations, to include traffic, industrial, or aircraft.  Any accident 
investigation that results in criminal charges is no longer deemed an accident 
for the purposes of this procedure.  It will be handled according to guidelines 
set forth in Section II, Police Investigations/Information.  The following 
information may be released: 

1. Location and time of occurrence 

2. Names and ages of drivers and injured; juvenile's names are not 
protected in accident investigations 

3. In traffic accidents, citations issued, to whom, and the offense 

4. A general estimate of damage 

5. Hospital(s) where the injured were transported 

V. PHOTOGRAPHS 

A. Photographs or video footage may be taken by media personnel of an 
adult suspect exposed in transit, but the suspect shall not be posed by 
officers. 

B. No photographs of any kind will be taken of a juvenile without court order.   
Officers should not attempt to prevent the news media from taking 
photographs, but shall not pose juveniles or in any way assist the media in 
photographing a juvenile. 

C. Accredited media photographers may take pictures of any scene if they do 
not endanger the public, police officers, themselves, or evidence.  If the scene 
is on private property, the photographer must obtain permission of the 
property owner and abide by restrictions imposed by the courts or utilize 
telephoto photography from a vantage point accessible to the public. 

  

D. Officers will not allow media representatives to accompany them as they 
enter a location to execute search or arrest warrants.  The warrant authorizes 
only law enforcement officials to make entry. 
E.  Members of the Public Affairs Unit may take and release non-evidentiary 
photographs of interest to the media providing that those photographs are 
taken from a vantage point at which the media, if present, would have had 
access to.

3.08.005  Radio Communications-Clear Channel 

To advise all personnel of the procedures to be followed to secure a clear 
channel. 

That members of the Department receive a clear radio communications channel 
when appropriate. 

Clear Channel:  A clear channel is a radio frequency devoted exclusively to a 
specific communication need or to a specific event.  To afford the security of 
being able to communicate when necessary and to not be distracted by 
unnecessary radio traffic, only persons directly involved are authorized to use the 
frequency while it is "clear." 

10-44:  The radio code for a clear channel. 

PROCEDURES 

I. PURPOSE OF A CLEAR CHANNEL 

A. General.  A clear channel (10-44) is appropriate anytime there is a 
requirement for a communications channel dedicated to an incident, so as to 
be free of all but situation-essential traffic.  This need usually arises from two 
basic causes: 

1. Emergencies.  Unplanned events with a high risk of imminent danger, 
and units on the scene require unimpeded communications as the 
situation dictates.  

2. Special operations or functions.  Parades, stake outs, traffic 
enforcement details, training, and other situations requiring discrete or 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DEFINITIONS 

  

uninterrupted radio availability.  Although not necessarily dangerous, such 
transmissions may require a clear radio channel to be successful. 

II. INITIATION 

A. For Emergencies.  A clear channel for an emergency situation may be 
called by anyone for cause, and is usually done on a main channel.  It is 
intended that a main channel 10-44 be of very short duration, primarily to 
allow officers to arrive on scene and assess the stability of the situation, or to 
deploy.  Note that a 10-44 called on a main channel is very disruptive to 
normal Department activities.  Once the initial assessment is accomplished, it 
is imperative that the 10-44 be transferred to and continued on a secondary 
channel if requirement for a clear channel remains.  

B. For Non-Emergencies.   A non-emergency or situational 10-44 requires 
that the person directing the operation ask for and confirm the availability of a 
channel in advance, and that the duration of the operation be stated.  Such a 
10-44 will be on a secondary channel. 

III. PROPER ACTION DURING A "10-44" 

A. Main Channel 10-44's. 

1. The dispatcher will rebroadcast the 10-44, and designate the channel to 
be used.  Units not involved in the specific call shall cease radio traffic on 
that channel. 

2. Responding units shall assess the situation and, as soon as safety 
permits, either authorize transferring the 10-44 to another channel, or 
cancel it entirely.  If transferred, the dispatcher shall coordinate with the 
involved officers, establish a 10-44 on another channel, and clear the 10-
44 on the main channel.  Unless specifically requested by an officer or 
Patrol supervisor, the dispatcher will not automatically monitor a 10-44 
established on a secondary channel. 

3. During the initial 10-44, radio traffic not pertaining to the 10-44 situation 
shall be suspended.  If it becomes apparent that the 10-44 will last longer 
than about 10 minutes, or if other priority radio traffic must be transmitted, 
officers shall then change their radio traffic to:  

a). A channel designated by the dispatcher; or 

b). In the absence of a designated channel, the utility channel. 

4. In extreme situations, Dispatch and field Supervisors or Commanders 
will address the best solution possible under the circumstances. 

B. Non-emergency 10-44's. 

1. Based on the pre-coordination between the Dispatch Center and the 
person in charge of the operation needing the 10-44, the agreed upon 
channel shall be designated at the time requested.  Patrol fallouts shall be 
advised of the channel status; uninvolved officers who suggest going to 
the affected channel shall be advised of its status. 

  

2. Unless specifically arranged, a dispatcher will not continually monitor a 
non-emergency 10-44. 

IV. TERMINATING OR "CLEARING" A 10-44 

A. Emergency, or Main Channel, 10-44's.  As discussed above, emergency 
10-44's shall be cleared or moved from main channel as soon as practical.  A 
unit at the scene or a Supervisor certain of the status of the situation may 
advise to clear or move the 10-44.  When advised, the dispatcher shall 
broadcast the termination or relocation.  If the 10-44 was of such duration as 
to have required moving the main channel, specific instructions will be 
provided to the units regarding resuming normal main channel operation.  

B. Non-emergency 10-44's.  These are assumed to end at the prearranged 
time.  In the absence of additional instruction, the channel will be cleared 
accordingly.  If the need for the 10-44 concludes, involved officers shall 
immediately notify the Dispatch Center, who will then clear the 10-44.  Normal 
use of the affected channel will then resume.

3.08.010  Radio Communications- General 

To instruct all employees in the general use of the police radio. 

That all members of the Department contribute to efficiency and safety by 
exercising professional radio discipline as presented in this procedure. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

PROCEDURES 

I. GENERAL PROCEDURES 

A. Overall Goals.  If a radio operator can keep the two fundamental 
ingredients of proper radio technique in mind, all other elements of effective 
radio communication fall into place.  These two are brevity and clarity.  Brevity 
conserves on-air time, which allows more messages to be conveyed, and 
gives more opportunity for the interjection of emergency information.  Clarity 
ensures that what information is transmitted is understood, so accuracy and 
efficiency are enhanced.  Both are utterly essential and at the foundation of 
proper radio technique.  Towards that end, the following suggestions are 
offered: 

1. Know what is to be communicated before beginning to talk.  Form the 
intended communication before you say it, in terms of language which 
should be clearly understood by the other party. 

2. Always monitor the radio.  This reduces interruptions and keeps the 
listener current on activities in the field. 

3. Initiate transmissions with proper identification of both yourself and the 
intended recipient. 

4. If a long transmission is unavoidable, insert a break to allow other radio 
users an opportunity to transmit priority communications. 

  

5. Balance formality and informality.  Being too stiff or formal is 
undesirable, but excessive casualness may suggest contempt or 
contribute to errors. 

6. Be polite.  Tone of voice can reduce stress as well as enhance 
accuracy. 

7. Acknowledge all transmissions received, but always ask questions if a 
message is unclear.  Be prepared to answer questions or to repeat your 
message. 

II. GENERAL REGULATIONS 

A. The police radio is for official use only.  It is intended and licensed for 
broadcasting information to and from mobile police units.  Although some 
personal and internal messages are conveyed on the radio, none must 
interfere with the primary police mission and/or FCC licensing standards. 

1. Car-to-car traffic is especially subject to procedural abuse.  Understand 
that there is no such thing as an "informal" discussion on any radio 
channel, so the same elements of professionalism exist. Avoid 
unnecessary talk, and realize all channels can be monitored. 

B. Radio transmissions shall be brief and to the point. 

C. Repeat information which must be written down, such as addresses or 
license plate numbers, to ensure accuracy. 

D. Radio codes will be used when their use conveys the desired information 
more clearly than plain language.  The phonetic alphabet will be used to 
clarify spellings and alphanumeric information.  Always remember that a 
"code" is just that--a symbol with a hidden meaning (often a long meaning, so 
codes can be very useful).  But to understand the message, the symbol has 
to be decoded, and everyone must use the same "decoder."  Consequently: 

1. Any use of codes will be limited to those 10-series and 11-series 
authorized in this and other Communications procedures.  Use of outdated 
codes or slang risks confusion, especially with newer employees. 

2. When using an authorized code, ensure the full code is spoken. For 
instance, an accident without injuries can be referred to as an "11-23," but 
not a "23."   

E. Emergency communications have priority over all other traffic. 

F. Profanity or vulgarity of any kind is prohibited. 

G. Disputes shall not be conducted on the air.  No matter how legitimate the 
complaint is, resolve it off the air. 

III. UNIT IDENTIFIERS 

A. On-duty units, with an assigned area and/or assigned identifier, shall use 
their duty-assigned identifier to the exclusion of any other. 

  

B. On-duty, retaining a permanently assigned identifier (I-, X-, O- units) shall 
use their assigned identifier. 

C. Off-duty, not assigned a permanent identifier, shall use Department Serial 
Number (DSN) or the issued home car designator (e.g. H-23), which ever 
applies.  Note that identifiers used during a special function (hostage 
negotiations, bomb disposal, etc.) are not considered permanent. 

D. Off-duty and assigned a permanent identifier shall use the permanent 
identifier.  Dispatch will maintain a list of permanently assigned identifiers. 

IV. RADIO CHANNEL UTILIZATION 

A. General.  The department uses the radio channels available to it in a 
variety of ways, depending on the purpose desired.  The general titles used in 
discussing channel assignment are: 

1. "Primary Channels" are radio frequencies which are monitored by a 
dispatcher 24 hours a day, and may therefore be used at any time by any 
authorized radio user as required to complete a task.  Secondary channels 
are not monitored. 

2. "Main channel" is a "primary channel" used to dispatch requests for 
service to field personnel, and to receive from them information or 
requests. 

3. "Utility Channel" is another type of primary channel, and is provided to 
assist field personnel with computer checks, requests for public 
assistance, phone calls, and other reasonable support functions.  All 
registration, warrant, and license status checks, and similar requests; 
requests for taxicabs, phone calls, and wreckers; public assist and other 
telephone contacts, and alarm status checks are some of the activities 
reserved for the utility channel. 

B. Channel Assignment. 

1. Radio channels are assigned as: 

a). Channel 1: Main channel dispatch 

b). Channel 2: Utility communications channel 

c). Channel 3: Main channel dispatch  

d). Channel 4: Patrol reserved 

e). Channel 5: Warrants/Detectives reserved (Voice Protected) 

f). Channel 6: Voice-Protected, normally reserved for Metro.  SWAT 
callout (or other priority situations requiring secure voice) will 
supersede Metro. 

g). Channel 7: Inter-car, tactical, etc. 

h).Channel 8: Inter-car, tactical, etc. 

2. Channels 1 and 3 are primary channels. 

  

3. Main channel dispatch may be split or combined.  Field units will utilize 
the channels as assigned. 

4. Officers engaging in nonessential communication with each other on a 
primary or main channel will switch to an appropriate secondary channel 
after their initial contact. 

5. It is the nature of police services that radio problems or emergencies 
may cause short term changes in channel usage, but under normal 
conditions, this channel usage plan will be adhered to by all personnel. 

V. TECHNIQUES 

A. Standardization of Method.  The following techniques are designed for 
consistency, therefore efficiency and safety. 

1. On emergency calls, Dispatch will announce the nature of the call and 
the location first, then attempt to contact the area car.  This alerts other 
units, both on and off duty, to emergency events, allowing them to 
respond while the dispatcher assigns a primary unit. 

2. When requesting a "10-52" (computer check), use the following format, 
and expect the following response: 

a). For a "persons" check, request "10-52 by [name, date of birth, 
social security number, operator's license number, or other appropriate 
identifier (or a combination thereof)]," and expect the dispatcher to 
respond with both a warrants check and an operator's license status 
check--unless you ask for one specifically. 

b). For a "vehicle" check, request "10-52 by [VIN, plate number, or 
other appropriate identifier]," and expect the dispatcher to respond with 
both registration information and significant remarks (reported stolen, 
reported impounded, transfer pending, etc.)--unless you ask for one 
specifically. 

3. When one unit calls another unit, the format is for the calling unit to 
identify it self first, then identify the desired unit. 

4. Avoid asking generic questions on the air.  For instance, transmitting 
"Does anyone have accident report forms?" risks cluttering the air with 
several units responding simultaneously.  These requests should be done, 
if practicable, over the MDC.

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DEFINITIONS 

Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD):  A computer system designed to assist 
Dispatch in its role of getting appropriate police resources to all calls for service.   

Down:  A radio code used to advise Dispatch that the unit is still on duty, but 
unavailable for dispatch due to a non-police service activity. 

Incident Numbers:  Sequential numbers assigned to any call for service. 

Leaving Scene (LS):  A term/abbreviation used to advise Dispatch that the unit is 
still involved with the current call for service, but is leaving the original dispatch 
location.   

Officer-Initiated ("OI"):  A radio code used to advise Dispatch that a unit is on a 
non-dispatched call. 

On:  A radio code used to advise Dispatch that a particular unit's tour of duty has 
begun, and that coordination of their activities is expected through the Dispatch.  

Off:  A radio code used by a unit to notify Dispatch that their tour of duty is over. 

Status:  A unit's activity, assignment, or working condition which determines its 
ability to be dispatched to calls for service. 

10-6:  A radio code used to advise a unit or Dispatch to disregard the last 
transmission or request, or to cancel a unit from the last call to which it was 
dispatched. 

 

  

10-7:  A radio code used to advise Dispatch that a unit has arrived at a 
dispatched call for service. 

10-8:  A radio code used to advise Dispatch that a unit is again available for 
dispatch. 

10-80:  A radio code used to advise Dispatch that a unit is on a lunch break. 

Disposition:  An advisement to Dispatch by an officer of how a call was handled. 
Officers assigned a particular call must inform Dispatch which type of disposition 
applies before going to another call: 

Alarm Codes:  When an officer is dispatched to an alarm, there are several 
dispositions the officer may provide to Dispatch. These dispositions are: 

Controlled Authorized (CA):  The alarm was activated by the owner, pets, house 
sitter, employees, etc. 

Controlled Malfunction (CM):  The alarm was caused by equipment malfunctions. 

Controlled Other (CO):  The cause for the alarm could not be determined. 

Uncontrolled Environmental (UE):  The alarm was caused by an earthquake, 
storm, wind, or other similar manner. 

Uncontrolled Utilities (UU):  The alarm was caused by a power outage, broken 
water pipe or similar manner. 

Cleared (C):  A call for service that was resolved at the scene by officers without 
an arrest, charges, or a report.  

Gone on Arrival (G):  The call for service cannot be located, and there is nothing 
available for officers to investigate. 

Parties Settled (PS):  If an officer finds that the parties of an auto collision have 
decided to settle the matter between them, the officer will advise Dispatch via the 
PS code and no report is required. 

Report:  Certain events require a field report to be written by officers, or officers 
may elect to write a report on a particular event.  In such cases, officers will 
request report case numbers from Dispatch. 

Supplement:  The officer is going to prepare a supplemental report to the original 
report. 

Unfounded (U):  There is no legal merit to the reported incident (no law has been 
broken, and no police services are necessary). 

Warning (W):  Used as a disposition on calls involving infractions and some 
misdemeanor crimes that require a warning prior to making an arrest.

a). Units are both "On" and 10-8. 

2. Not being available to send on a call.  A unit is not immediately 
available if: 

a). It is "On," but not presently available for CAD to dispatch because: 

i. The unit is on a police service activity, which CAD subcategorizes 
as either: 

(1). A dispatched call for service, identified by officers as being 
"10-7"; or 

(2). Involved in officer-initiated police activity 

ii. On a non-police service activity.  CAD recognizes two 
possibilities: 

(1). Lunch ("10-80") or 

(2). All other non-police service activities (vehicle maintenance, 
as an example).  Officers inform Dispatch of these activities by 
advising "OS," and go back in service by advising "10-8." 

b). It is "Off" which, for CAD only, includes: 

i. Patrol officers who are not on their tour of duty; and 

ii. Detectives, whether on their tour of duty or not; and 

iii. Administrators, whether on their tour of duty or not. 

II. INITIATING CALLS FOR SERVICE 

A. General.  Units handling a request for service are referred to as being "on 
a call," and are considered to be unavailable for all but emergency 
dispatches.  The unit is made aware of requests for service generally from 
two sources; either as a dispatched call for service, or as an officer- initiated 
activity. 

1. Dispatched requests for service, which usually start as telephone calls 
to Dispatch, and are processed as follows: 

a). A call-taker in Dispatch records information provided by the citizen 
or other caller.   

i. As soon as it is entered into CAD, incident numbers are assigned. 

b). The dispatcher assigns the call to an appropriate unit(s). 

i. Units not dispatched to calls will not respond without first advising 
Dispatch, unless doing so is tactically inappropriate. 

c). Unit(s) arriving at a dispatched call will advise Dispatch by radioing, 
"10-7... (unit designator)."  

  

i. If the officer's investigation/case resolution requires leaving the 
scene, Dispatch shall be advised the unit is "LS" and the 
destination. 

ii. The primary unit also has the responsibility to advise Dispatch of 
any material corrections (corrections to addresses or call 
classification). 

2. The second source of calls is Officer-Initiated activities (OI).   

a). A major part of Patrol officers' duty obligation is that they actively 
look for situations requiring police service.  Additionally, different 
sections of the Department (most notably Warrants and Detectives) 
routinely become involved in events requiring contact and coordination 
with Dispatch (traffic stops, criminal activity in progress, and other such 
occurrences).  Recognizing that the police do more than merely 
respond to dispatched calls for service, CAD has been programmed to 
accept officer-initiated police activities.  

i. Regardless of duty status, officers may conduct police business 
on their own initiative by advising Dispatch "OI", then the activity, 
then their unit designation. 

(1). If "On", the unit designation is the area assignment, as 
would be normal with any radio traffic. 

(2). If "Off", the unit designation would be the permanent 
designator (if one is assigned), Department Serial Number 
(DSN), or assigned Home Car designator as appropriate. 

III. DISPOSITION OF CALLS 

A. Call Disposition Procedure.   

A call should not be considered finished by officers until all anticipated activity 
is done.  Follow-up at hospitals, transports to the magistrate and jail and other 
similar actions are part of the case and should be done prior to going back 
into service. 

When calling back into service, officers are required to inform Dispatch of two 
essential items: 

1. Any corrections, the most common and important being: 

a). Reclassification of the event from what was originally dispatched.  If 
officers determine the event to be something other than what was 
originally dispatched, officers shall state the true call title. 

b). Location corrections. 

B. The Type of Disposition Only one disposition can be entered.  Officers 
must select the single most descriptive disposition to the case. 

There are several dispositions for calls, which are defined in the definitions.  
The types of dispositions are: 

  

1. Report  

2. Supplement  

3. Gone on Arrival (G) 

4. Unfounded (U) 

5. Clear (C)  

6. Warning (W) 

7. Parties Settled (PS) 

8. Alarms (Various Dispositions) 

a). On receipt of this information, the dispatcher will: 

i. Enter or confirm the exact nature of the call for service (for 
accurate statistical purposes, and for later tracking); then  

ii. Put the unit back into service; which, in turn 

iii. Clears the screen entirely of the event.  Once the event is off the 
screen, officers must consult the computer for information regarding 
that call.  This helps explain the importance of officers not going 
back into service prior to concluding all anticipated activities on that 
call.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.09.000  Unit Coordination 

3.09.005  Barricaded Suspect and Hostage Situation 

To advise all personnel of the policies and procedures governing incidents 
involving barricaded suspects and incidents where hostages have been taken. 

The policy of the Anchorage Police Department is to ensure the preservation of 
human life and the public safety.  For this reason, it is imperative that personnel 
involved in the handling of barricaded subjects or incidents of hostage-taking are 
aware of procedures that will aid in bringing such incidents to a successful 
conclusion in the safest manner possible. 

Any critical incident, but especially one involving the barricading of an armed and 
dangerous subject and/or the taking of hostages, requires collective effort 
drawing on all available resources of the Department and related agencies.  
History has demonstrated repeatedly that the taking of reasonable time and the 
using of the resources at hand to deal with such incidents most often results in 
concluding the incident without harm to any of the parties involved, be it 
hostages, officers or suspects. 

It is essential that personnel not engage in independent action unless forced to 
do so by circumstances; individual initiative in these situations quite often results 
in injury or death, whereas collective action generally will not. 

DEFINITIONS 

Barricaded Suspect:  Any person believed to be armed, who has committed a 
crime or threatened suicide, and who is secreted in a position that affords them a 
tactical or strategic advantage. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

  

Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team:  Those Department members 
assigned as tactical unit officers for high-risk enforcement procedures. 

C.N.T-Crises Negotiation Team:  Those Department members assigned as 
Police Negotiators.

incident.   

I. DETERMINATION CRITERIA 

PROCEDURE 

A. First Responders may find themselves involved in a barricade or hostage-
taking incident through a radio dispatch to a seemingly innocuous incident.  
They may also find that an incident such as a field-initiated activity rapidly 
becomes a barricade or hostage-taking incident.  Rarely will the First 
Responder know precisely that a barricade or hostage incident is what he or 
she will have to deal with prior to arrival at the scene.   

1. A barricade incident is indicated when the following criteria exist:  

a). The suspect(s) is believed to be armed, and 

b). has committed a crime or threatened suicide, and 

c). presents a significant threat to the safety of citizens or officers, and 

d). has a tactical or strategic advantage, and 

  

e). refuses to submit to lawful police action. 

2. A hostage-taking incident is indicated when the suspect, in addition to 
the conditions above, restrains another person(s) unlawfully in an attempt 
to gain an advantage or further an unlawful activity through the threat of 
violence.  

II. FIRST RESPONDER RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication. B. Once the First Responder(s) 
makes the determination that a barricade or hostage-taking incident exists, 
and immediate intervention is not required, they shall: 

1. Notify Dispatch of the incident. 

2. Request that a supervisor and/or command officer respond. 

3. Select one officer as Scene Commander pending the arrival of a 
supervisor or command officer.  This officer will have the responsibility and 
authority of Scene Commander until relieved by a superior. 

4. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication. 5. Establish an outer 
perimeter for protection of the public, crowd control, and traffic control if 
needed. 

6. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.  

7. Request an AFD paramedic unit to respond to the Command Post. 

8. First Responders shall, when reasonably able to do so, gather the 
following information and relay it to the Incident Commander and/or the 
command subordinates, as well as a synopsis of the situation: 

a). What, if any, crime(s) have been committed? 

b). Have any shots been fired? 

c). Has anyone been injured? 

d). Has there been any contact with the suspect by any means? 

e). Has the suspect been asked to surrender? 

f). Is the area cordoned off? 

g). Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication 

h). What is a good staging area for the media? 

i). Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication. j). What are the exact 
address, phone number, and physical description and orientation of the 
location? 

k). Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication. l). What weapons and 
equipment are available to the suspect? 

m). Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication. n). What is the 
suspect‘s mental state and background? 

  

o). Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.  

9. First Responders will request a secure, clear radio channel from 
Dispatch. 

10. First Responders should use runners to communicate when possible, 
and must limit secure-channel radio traffic to essential communications 
only. 

C. Once these preliminary steps have been taken, no further 
independent action will be taken by First Responders.   

D. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.  

E. Once relieved from any of the above duties, First Responders will report to 
the Command Post for debriefing and reassignment, or release from further

C. Once a barricade or hostage-taking incident determination has been made, 
and concurred with by the responding supervisor or command officer, an 
authorization to Communications for a call-out of SWAT and CNT may be 
made by the supervisor or command officer. 

1. No officer at a lower command level may make this authorization unless 
no supervisor or command officer is available to make the determination, 
and the circumstances warrant a call-out.

3.09.010  High Risk Warrant Service 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

To advise all personnel of the policies and procedures governing high-risk arrests 
and warrant services. 

A fundamental policy of the Anchorage Police Department is the preservation of 
human life, including the lives of our officers.  For this reason, SWAT will be 
deployed when the threat levels discussed in this procedure have been reached 
in the execution of high-risk arrests and warrant services. 

High Risk Arrests-SWAT should be used in arrest situations where there is prior 
knowledge of a significant threat or danger to the public, police or suspect.  In 
most investigations, officers have time to plan the arrest of violent suspects.  
Arrests of armed drug dealers and gang members, homicide and shooting 
suspects, robbery suspects and others who are likely to resist with deadly force, 
should if practical be handled by SWAT.   

It is not the intent of this section to prohibit officers from responding to 
emergency calls for service where they are forced to arrest violent suspects upon 
arrival, such as robberies in progress or shootings. 

High-Risk Search Warrants-Narcotics and undercover officers, as well as other 
detectives, often find themselves faced with having to serve search warrants at 
locations that are fortified or occupied with persons who are expected to be 
armed and likely to resist with deadly force.  

Emergency teams are used successfully nationwide to provide police 
departments with the necessary resources to safely handle these high-risk 
enforcement situations.  This reduces the risk to our officers as much as 
possible.  For these reasons, high-risk search warrants will also be handled by 
SWAT.  

  

DEFINITIONS 

Barricaded Suspect:  Any person believed to be armed, who has committed a 
crime or threatened suicide, and who is secreted in a position that affords them a 
tactical or strategic advantage. 

Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team:  Those Department members 
assigned as tactical unit officers for high-risk enforcement procedures. 

SWAT Commander:  Highest ranking SWAT member at the scene; generally the 
team‘s Lieutenant.  

High Risk Arrest:  An arrest where the suspect(s) are expected to be armed, 
have demonstrated a propensity for violence, have fortified their location, or have 
threatened resistance through deadly force. 

Warrant Service:  An arrest warrant, search warrant, or any other court-ordered 
service.  

I. CRITERIA FOR USE 

PROCEDURE 

A. SWAT will be called and assigned the following high-risk arrests or warrant 
services when the suspect(s): 

1. Are expected to be armed; or 

2. Have demonstrated a propensity for violence; or 

3. Are expected to have fortified their location; or 

4. Have threatened resistance through deadly force; or 

5. Any other warrant services requiring the use of specialized entry 
equipment and/or personnel. 

II. REQUESTS FOR USE OF SWAT 

A. The Division Commander shall be responsible for determining whether the 
criteria for using SWAT exists (Section A., above).  If so, then the following 
procedure will be used: 

1. The Division Commander shall contact and brief the SWAT 
Commander.  The SWAT Commander will notify the Captain of the Crime 
Suppression Division, who will be responsible for notification of the Deputy 
Chief and Chief for final approval.  In the event that SWAT is activated, the 
Division Commander should know that: 

a). The SWAT Commander will notify the SWAT supervisor, who will 
allocate team resources based on the situation.  A briefing will be 
scheduled as soon as possible. 

b). If the requesting unit has an emergency arrest situation requiring 
SWAT, then the designated SWAT element will immediately deploy to 
a staging area for assignment. 

  

2. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.  

III. USE OF SWAT UNIFORMS AND PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 

A. SWAT members are not permitted to suit up for any detail not being 
directly supervised by one of the SWAT Team Leaders. 

1. All personnel should keep in mind that if the threat level of a call or 
assignment causes enough concern to consider having on-duty SWAT 
personnel suit up, then the call probably warrants that SWAT be called out 
as outlined in SWAT Unit Coordination Procedure.  

2. If the officers are dressed in tactical gear, their deployment will be 
viewed as a SWAT operation by the courts, suspects, witnesses, and 
press, regardless of sentiments to the contrary.  SWAT leaders will thus 
be held accountable for the outcome of the deployment.  They should be 
involved in any such decisions regarding team use.   

3. SWAT leaders must be able to justify any deviation from this should 
team use result in damage, injury, or death.  Because of these factors, 
SWAT leaders shall actively manage situations that involve their 
personnel becoming involved in hazardous activity.

3.09.015  SWAT Unit Coordination 

To advise all personnel of the proper method of coordinating police activities with 
those of the Special Weapons and Tactics team (SWAT), by describing SWAT‘s 
role and its deployment standards and procedures. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

That SWAT is deployed whenever the standards discussed in this procedure are 
met so as to minimize risk to all lives and property according to the following 
priority: 

The lives of hostages 

The lives of citizens in proximity to violence 

Safety of officers 

Constitutional rights of the suspect(s) 

DISCUSSION 

The duties of a uniformed patrol officer are so wide and varied that it is difficult to 
be highly proficient in all areas at all times.  Certain specialized situations, 
however, demand continued proficiency and unique equipment to ensure the 
safest resolution reasonable for all, including the suspect.  The Anchorage Police 
Department has met this challenge by adopting a procedure shown successful in 
other jurisdictions; it has selected a group of sworn officers and, as a team, given 
them specialized initial and continued training, and provided them with unique 
equipment.  This team is called the ―Special Weapons and Tactics‖ team, 
(SWAT).  Simply put, SWAT‘s mission is to save lives. 

Virtually everything that SWAT undertakes is directed toward safety.  The team 
strives to contain, defuse, and resolve sensitive situations with the least amount 
of injury and damage that is reasonable under the circumstances.  To facilitate 

  

the successful resolution of such sensitive situations, the rest of the department, 
and most especially uniformed patrol, must work in unison with SWAT.   

DEFINITIONS 

Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team:  A team of sworn officers specially 
selected, trained, and equipped to handle specialized police situations in the 
safest reasonable manner.  Answers to SWAT Commander. 

Scene Commander:  For purposes of this procedure, the ranking regular duty 
officer at the crisis scene.  Usually a Patrol Lieutenant; sometimes a Patrol 
Sergeant.  Supervises all aspects of the initial stages of an incident, but is 
relieved of various responsibilities as specialized personnel arrive.  Generally 
retains responsibility for managing outer perimeter, and other patrol functions, for 
the duration of the event.  Scene Commander answers to the Incident 
Commander (once that person arrives). 

SWAT Commander:  Highest ranking SWAT member at the scene; generally the 
team‘s lieutenant.  [Note: The permanent SWAT lieutenant is also commander of 
the Crisis Negotiation Team (a.k.a. Hostage Negotiators) and the Command Post 
Technicians, groups which are also typically present at a crisis scene.]  SWAT 
Commander answers to the Incident Commander. 

Incident Commander:  The administrator assigned to run the Command Post and 
direct the overall operation.  Generally the Captain of Patrol retains incident 
command status even on arrival of Deputy Chief and/or Chief unless specifically 
relieved. 

I.THE ROLE OF SWAT 

PROCEDURE 

A. Operating Philosophy.  To achieve the goal of safety, SWAT has an 
operating philosophy based on the following techniques: 

1. Careful planning and coordination; and 

2. Discipline and teamwork, with commensurate physical ability; and 

3. Progressive escalation of tactical responses. 

B. Utilization.  SWAT specializes in the following types of police activities: 

1. Barricade situations 

2. Hostage events 

3. Acts of terrorism 

4. High-risk warrant service 

5. Protective assignments, including dignitary protection details 

6. Demonstrations and/or acts of civil disobedience 

7. Other assignments that lend themselves to the specialized training, 
equipment, and physical capabilities of SWAT 

  

II. SWAT EMERGENCY CALL-OUT 

A. Standards.  Many duties are assigned to SWAT in advance for proper 
planning and detailing.  However, certain situations require an emergency 
call-out. Standards have been set to guide employees in the decision to call 
SWAT.  These standards are as follows: 

1. SWAT shall be called out any time officers find themselves confronted 
by a situation in which all five of the following conditions exist.  The 
suspect(s): 

a). Are believed to be armed; and  

b). Have committed a crime or threatened suicide; and  

c). Present a significant threat to the safety of citizens or officers; and 

d). Possess tactical or strategic advantage; and 

e). Have refused to surrender to the police. 

B. Requests for SWAT by Outside Agencies.  Requests for SWAT made by 
outside agencies shall be immediately referred to the Patrol Captain or SWAT 
Commander for consideration.  That person shall evaluate the request based 
on the nature of the threat, and not upon the perceived ability or inability of 
the requesting agency to effectively react, nor yet upon the mere existence of 
a mutual aid agreement.  Once a decision has been reached the Chief and 
Deputy Chief shall be briefed through the chain of command, and shall 
approve or disapprove the initial recommendation. 

C. Emergency Requests for SWAT within APD Jurisdiction.  Once the Scene 
Commander has established that the five criteria for emergency call-out have 
been met, the following procedure shall be followed: 

1. The Patrol Captain and the SWAT Commander shall be contacted for 
approval.  If approved, the Chief and Deputy Chief shall be immediately 
notified. 

2. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.  

3. Make notification of SWAT by: 

a). Using the telephone for notifications (rather than radio) whenever 
reasonable. 

b). Having the SWAT supervisor through the SWAT team leaders or 
their designees handle the actual team call-up. 

c). Being prepared to answer the following questions when asked: 

i. What is the situation? 

ii. What crime(s) have been committed? 

iii. What type of weapons are involved? 

iv. Have any shots been fired? 

  

v. Has anyone been injured? 

vii. Are there hostages? 

viii. What is the recommended location for the Command Post? 

ix. What is the safest approach route? 

d).The Scene Commander should be prepared to relinquish authority 
to the Incident Commander, normally stationed at the Command Post.  
The Incident Commander will direct both patrol and SWAT (as well as 
CRU, CP staff, Detectives, etc.), and the SWAT commander will have 
responsibility for tactics. The transfer of authority from the Scene 
Commander to the Incident Commander and or the SWAT 
Commander should be a clear and positive transfer of authority. 

D. Coordination of Patrol & SWAT Efforts. 

1. General.  Once SWAT is deployed, patrol still plays a central role.  The 
Incident Commander (at the Command Post) directs both the SWAT 
Commander and Patrol‘s Scene Commander, thus providing the first level 
of coordination between the two.  Beyond that, Patrol personnel can 
expect to perform the specific duties discussed in the next paragraph. 

E. Coordination of Patrol Efforts. 

1. Specific Duties.  The Scene Commander is responsible for the 
following: 

a). Creation of an outer perimeter.   

d). Witness/critical people control.  The scene commander shall direct 
the identification and isolation of witnesses, family members, and other 
key people. 

F. Miscellaneous Considerations for Patrol.  Patrol officers are reminded of 
the following issues, which are critical to the successful coordination of a 
tactical response: 

1. Communications.  It is essential that the Command Post receive and 
understand all tactically significant information possessed by patrol units in 
the field.  To this end it is important that patrol officers remember to: 

a). Obtain a clear channel; 

b). Exercise extreme radio discipline; limit traffic to essentials; 

c). Report perimeter positions, observations, and actions in a clear and 
concise manner; 

d). Use runners to deliver messages when reasonable (diagrams are 
extremely helpful); 

e). Conduct nonessential radio traffic on other channels, and refer all 
requests (including those which are nonessential in nature) to the 
Scene Commander;   

  

f). Advise Dispatch Center when clearing a tactical channel. 

2. Perimeter officer safety.  Officers must balance their duty to observe 
the actions at the scene with their efforts to practice fundamental 
principles of officer safety.   

3. Focus of Objectives.  Know your role and keep the overall objective 
in mind.   

4. Debriefing.  Patrol officers should expect to report to the Command 
Post on being relieved.  Many perimeter officers become witnesses, and 
will have to make statements to assigned investigators. 

III. SWAT SCHEDULED (NON-EMERGENCY) DETAILS 

A. Events.  SWAT may be assigned tasks of a non-emergency nature, 
including: 

1. Warrant Service where the suspect(s): 

a). Are expected to be armed; or 

b). Have demonstrated a propensity for violence; or 

c). Are expected to have fortified their location; or 

d). Have threatened resistance through deadly force; 

2. Warrant Service requiring the use of specialized equipment and/or 
personnel to rapidly secure the scene (such as to prevent the destruction 
of evidence), 

3. Dignitary protection details, 

4. Demonstrations or acts of civil disobedience (including strikes, riots, sit-
ins, etc.), 

5. Any other duties deemed by the Chief to require the specialized 
training, equipment, or physical capabilities of SWAT. 

IV. USE OF SWAT INDIVIDUALS 

A. Use of SWAT Members to Handle Calls. 

1. On duty SWAT personnel may be assembled by their regular 
supervisors and used for challenging situations (those in which training, 
discipline, and teamwork are particularly important), provided that: 

a). Call-out criteria have not been met (Section B); 

b). Scheduled detail criteria have not been met (Section C); 

c). Special Weapons may be employed; 

d). SWAT uniforms, team equipment and protective gear are not used.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance

3.09.020  Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) 

PURPOSE 

The purpose of this policy is to advise all personnel of the proper method of 
coordinating the activities of the Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) by describing 
CIT‘s role and its deployment standards and procedures.  In addition, to advise 
those personnel assigned as police Crisis Intervention Team officers of their 
duties, authority, and responsibility. 

POLICY 

The policy of the Anchorage Police Department is to ensure the preservation of 
human life and the public‘s safety.  For this reason, it is imperative that personnel 
involved in the handling of persons with a mental illness are aware of procedures 
that will aid in bringing such contacts to a successful conclusion in the safest 
manner possible.  The special skills and training of the Crisis Intervention Team 
officers should be employed during intervention with those persons who have a 
mental illness, using the standards discussed in this procedure, so as to 
minimize risk to the lives of officers and the public, and to connect those in need 
with the services of the mental health community.  

DISCUSSION 

The duties of a uniformed patrol officer are so wide and varied that it is 
impossible to be proficient in all areas at all times.  Certain specialized situations 
demand continued proficiency to ensure the safest resolution possible for all.  
The Anchorage Police Department has met this challenge by adopting an 
intervention approach shown to be successful in other jurisdictions.  A group of 
sworn officers and Dispatchers have been selected and given specialized 
training in regard to handling calls with a mental health element, while they also 
continue to handle regular calls for police service.  This team is called the Crisis 
Intervention Team (CIT), which is based upon the Memphis (TN) model 
established in 1988.  

  

The Anchorage Police Department Crisis Intervention Team is composed of 
volunteer officers and Dispatchers who are specially selected and trained to 
provide an immediate response to crisis involving persons with mental illness and 
to work with the community to resolve each situation in a manner that shows 
concern for the individual‘s well-being.  The officers are part of a community 
based partnership which includes consumers, their family members, and 
consumer advocacy groups such as the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill 
(NAMI), and mental health providers. 

The mission of CIT is to provide a humane and calm approach to assisting 
people with mental illness and connect them with the services available through 
mental health providers.  The goal is to reduce potentially violent emotional and 
physical confrontations with law enforcement and provide consumers with better 
patient care. Mental illness is a disease, not a crime.  It is the desire of the 
Anchorage Police Department, through these community partnerships, to 
maintain community confidence in the ability of the police to provide a quality 
service to all citizens.  

DEFINITIONS 

Consumer:  A term commonly used in the mental health field to identify a person 
who is the recipient of mental health services or is in need of mental health 
intervention. 

Crisis Intervention Team (CIT):  Those Department members assigned as CIT 
officers for crisis intervention with persons who have a mental illness. 

Crisis Negotiation Team (CNT):  Those Department members assigned as police 
negotiators. 

Mental Illness:  An organic, mental, or emotional impairment that has substantial 
adverse effects on an individual‘s ability to exercise conscious control of the 
individual‘s actions or ability to perceive reality or to reason or understand.  
Mental retardation, epilepsy, drug addiction, and alcoholism do not necessarily 
constitute mental illness, although persons suffering from these conditions may 
also be suffering from mental illness. 

Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team:  Those Department members 
assigned as tactical unit officers for high-risk enforcement procedures. 

I. ORGANIZATION 

PROCEDURE 

Members of the CIT are both sworn and non-sworn personnel drawn from the 
Patrol Division and other units of the Department.  CIT officers will respond to a 
call for service involving a person with a possible or known mental illness 
whenever available or requested and Dispatchers who take the original calls for 
service.  CIT officers are not available to be ―called out‖ while off duty without 
specific Commander and/or Supervisor approval.  CIT officers may be asked to 
work with a specific consumer as a continuing assignment until appropriate 
measures are taken by the social services agencies.  

  

II. TRAINING/IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 

All CIT officers and Dispatchers will first obtain their certification after having 
attended a 40-hour course.  After certification, CIT trained personnel are 
encouraged to apply for and attend continuing education regarding mental 
illnesses, medications and current methods.  All CIT officers shall wear an 
approved insignia on their uniform in order to identify the specific training they 
have received.  

III. DISPATCH CENTER RESPONSIBILTIES 

A. Call Taker.  Upon receipt of a call, the Call Taker should attempt to 
determine if there is an element of mental illness involved with the call.  If so, 
the call taker should indicate those circumstances in the details of call, both in 
narrative form and by adding the three letter code ―CTX‖ in the text of the call.  
The call priority should be assigned based upon available circumstances and 
the established dispatch priority guidelines.  

B. Dispatcher.  Once the call is received, the Dispatcher shall determine if 
there is a CIT Officer available to respond.  A CIT officer will be dispatched to 
handle these calls whenever possible, regardless of area assignment.  CIT 
Officers will be assigned to the calls first by beat, then by district, third by 
sector and finally city-wide.  It is within this procedure to have a CIT Officer 
respond outside his or her beat or district for a call with a mental health 
element.  

1. Mental Patient/Consumer Call for Service.  A minimum of two officers 
should be dispatched when available, one of whom should be a CIT-
Trained Officer.  If no CIT officers are available city-wide, two officers will 
be dispatched.  

2. Suicide Call for Service.  If the call is in progress, a minimum of two 
officers, preferably, one of which is CIT-trained, should be dispatched 
based upon availability.  The communications supervisor will be notified.  
If the attempt has already occurred, but the subject has not been 
transported for medical treatment, a minimum of two officers will be sent, 
one of which should be a CIT officer.  An On-duty Patrol Sergeant will be 
notified. 

3. Assigned Consumer Call for Service.  If the subject of the call is a 
known mental health consumer who has an assigned CIT officer, it is 
preferable to dispatch the assigned officer, if available and on-duty, to the 
call.  

IV. RESPONDING OFFICER‘S RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Officers should respond to the scene of a CIT call as soon as available.  
CIT Officers are encouraged to monitor radio traffic to determine if they might 
be needed at a particular call.  The response priority is to be determined by 
dispatch unless an officer has specific, articulable information to change the 
response priority.  

  

B. Upon arrival to the scene, the CIT officer will make a determination about 
how the call is handled.  The CIT officer on the scene of a mental crisis call 
has the responsibility for the scene and, if necessary, should request other 
officers to support a team effort or approach for a safe and appropriate 
disposition of the call.  Additional resources, such as SWAT or CRU, can be 
summoned if needed.  The CIT officer will maintain scene responsibility 
unless otherwise directed by a scene supervisor.  

C. Officers, whether CIT-trained or not, have a responsibility to thoroughly 
investigate these calls for service and take all necessary actions to safeguard 
the officers and citizens involved.  Consideration should be given regarding 
the need to possibly provide mental health services for the individual.  
Officers are encouraged to review the policy, Protective Custody – Persons 
with a Mental Illness, 3.02.105.  This policy provides information regarding 
available options for mental health consumers.

3.09.025  Crisis Negotiation Team 

To advise all personnel regarding the duties, authority and responsibilities of 
those personnel assigned as police crisis negotiators with the Crisis Negotiation 
Team. 

That the negotiation skills and training of the Crisis Negotiation Team be 
employed during critical law-enforcement operations to minimize risk to the lives 
of officers and the public.   

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

The Anchorage Police Department Crisis Negotiation Team is comprised of 
sworn officers specially selected and trained to work in conjunction with other 
officers and/or SWAT to defuse volatile situations involving barricaded subjects 
with or without hostages, employing their skills as negotiators to bring critical 
incidents to peaceful conclusions if at all possible.  Although officers routinely 
possess communication skills necessary for their day-to-day efforts that many 
times resolve a dispute or incident before it becomes critical, the special skills 
and training of police negotiators are often extremely helpful when employed in 
urgent situations that might otherwise result in needless suffering and death if not 
given careful, specialized handling. 

As the policy of the Anchorage Police Department is always to preserve human 
life and ensure public safety, it is imperative that specially trained officers be 
employed in critical incidents where their presence might make the difference in 
lives saved – whether that of criminal suspect, innocent victim, officers or the 
mentally-disturbed individual bent on self-destruction. 

The purpose of this procedure, therefore, is to describe the organization, role, 
duties and requirements for Crisis Resolution Unit team members at the 
Anchorage Police Department. 

  

DEFINITIONS 

Barricaded Suspect:  Any person armed with a weapon, explosive, or other 
destructive or dangerous device, who occupies and/or fortifies a fixed location 
and violently or by threat of violence, resists apprehension efforts by law 
enforcement officers.  This may include those persons threatening suicide 
through the use of a dangerous weapon or instrument, and/or present a 
significant threat to the safety of law enforcement personnel and/or the public, 
and/or are likely to consummate the act of suicide if no intervention occurs. 

Crisis Intervention Team (CIT):  Those Department members assigned as CIT 
officers who have received specialized training to aid in the handling of a call for 
service for crisis intervention with persons who have a mental illness. 

Crisis Negotiation Team (CNT):  Those Department members assigned as police 
negotiators. 

First Responder:  Any member of the law enforcement community who is the 
first, or among the first persons to arrive at an incident scene.  Generally, First 
Responders will be officers assigned to the Patrol division, or members of 
another law enforcement agency serving in a similar capacity.   

Hostage:  Any person seized, kidnapped, and/or otherwise unlawfully restrained 
by another, where the perpetrator threatens the life of, or threatens great bodily 
injury to, the person held with the intent to evade arrest, escape, obtain the 
release of persons in custody, obtain moneys or property, or attain any other 
objective. 

Incident Commander:  That officer in overall command and control of a critical 
incident.  This overall command position typically rises in rank as higher levels of 
command structure arrive at an incident.  Any sworn officer may serve as 
Incident Commander as circumstances warrant. 

Police Negotiations:  For the purpose of this procedure, police negotiations are 
those processes of verbal communication or ―bargaining‖ between primary 
participants in an incident and specially-trained officers, in an effort to resolve all 
such critical incidents by non-violent means.   

Primary Participant:  Those persons within the immediate confines of an incident 
scene, to include suspect(s), hostage(s), and/or those within the span of control 
of and under immediate threat from the suspect(s). 

Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT):  Those Department members assigned 
as tactical unit officers for high-risk enforcement procedures.   

I. ORGANIZATION. 

PROCEDURE 

A. Unit Command.  Members of CNT are sworn personnel drawn from all 
divisions, sections and units of the Anchorage Police Department, but as a 
unit serve under the command of the Captain of Patrol, with subordinate 
command under that division head in the Special Operations section by a 

  

Special Operations commander if designated (having joint command over 
CNT and SWAT). 

B. Incident Command.  During the course of a critical incident in which CNT is 
employed in conjunction with SWAT and other sections or units, overall 
command of CNT is exercised by the Incident Commander or designated 
subordinate as CNT commander. 

II. ROLE OF CNT. 

A. Utilization.  Generally, CNT may be employed in any situation where their 
skills will enhance the First Responders ability to resolve a crisis, or when an 
incident is of such gravity or magnitude that specially-trained negotiators 
should be employed to ensure the highest possibility of successful resolution 
without loss of life.  CNT specializes in providing negotiation skills in incidents 
involving: 

1. Barricaded subjects, whether criminal or other. 

2. Hostage taking. 

3. Mentally disturbed persons where there is an immediate threat of injury 
to themselves or others. 

4. Suicide intervention, especially when a weapon or other immediate 
threat of injury is involved. 

B. Function.  CNT concentrates its involvement in situations by verbally 
contacting barricaded subjects, hostage takers, and persons threatening 
suicide or the like, with the purpose of convincing these persons to submit to 
lawful authority or appropriate care as necessary.  Throughout such verbal 
communication, the aim of CNT is to defuse critical situations through the use 
of interpersonal communication skills built up through practice and training.  
Further, CNT uses those communication skills along with common-sense to 
affect a willingness on the part of the primary participant ―talked with‖ to agree 
that the suggestions and advice of the negotiator are in his or her best 
interest and to be complied with, or even accepted as their own.   

CNT negotiators will communicate with suspect(s) and/or primary participants 
by any means necessary.  Although extraordinary situations may dictate 
communication in writing (by relayed notes) or by sign, verbal communication 
is by far preferred, due to the strong positive psychological impact of such 
personal contact between negotiator and primary participant.  In order of 
preference, verbal negotiations will be conducted: 

1. By normal telephone connection (installed utility). 

Direct utility-installed telephone contact is preferred due to its almost 
universally being already in place for use, its ease of operation, and the 
safety its use offers to police personnel.  Telephone use also significantly 
increases the positive aspect of contact through familiarity with the device 
and its generally clear, personal tone – ―almost like being there.‖   

  

2. By cellular telephone. 

The cellular telephone is second in preference due to its increasing 
availability and the safety its use offers to police personnel.  Officers 
should be aware of the lack of ability to control outgoing calls.   

 

C. Operation.  The CNT negotiators may operate in conjunction with patrol 
personnel on incidents of minor scope, such as suicide-intervention situations 
or those involving limited threat levels, in teams of two negotiators.  In major 
incidents involving multiple-unit responses including SWAT, negotiators 
operate in teams of three or four.  Being trained to function as negotiators as 
a specialty, CNT members will not become tactically involved in an incident 
situation unless: 

1. Directly ordered to do so by an Incident Commander;  

-OR- 

D. Scope of Negotiations.  Negotiations conducted by CNT will include all 
‗bargaining‘ with primary participants for all agreements, terms, actions and 
items, subject to the direction and discretion of the Incident Commander.   

1. Negotiations will be conducted while taking into consideration the 
following: 

Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.  

7. All active negotiations conversation between primary negotiator and 
primary participants shall be tape-recorded, when possible. 

III. CALL-OUT AND ACTIVATION PROCEDURE. 

A. Notification.  CNT members will be notified of the call-out of their unit 
and/or team ordering their response to an incident by the Incident 
Commander or CNT /Special Operations Commander.  Notification will be 
made by the CNT /Special Operations Commander or his designee by any of 
several means, to include: 

1. Telephone.  CNT personnel must keep Dispatch apprised of any 
changes in contact numbers and provide cell phone numbers to the 
CNT/Special Operations Commander for inclusion in Dispatch lists. 

2. Pager.  CNT personnel must carry their pagers with them at all times 
during their on-call intervals, and also when they are otherwise available 
for duty. 

CNT personnel are required to be available for duty at all times while on-
call except when on leave or, during off-duty periods, beyond a 
reasonable distance to respond to incidents within the Anchorage area, 
unless prior arrangements have been made with a unit Supervisor.   

3. Radio.  If telephone or pager contact with a team member is not 
successful, Dispatch personnel will notify team members of call-out by 

  

radio.  Team members must monitor police radio channels at all times 
when in a vehicle so equipped, or when a police portable radio is carried 
during duty or on-call periods.  CNT personnel are encouraged to make 
their availability known, whether on or off duty, to an Incident Commander 
upon monitoring radio traffic indicating that an incident possibly requiring 
their services is in progress, and may respond at the Incident 
Commander‘s request without the formal call-out procedure being 
initiated.   

B. CNT Team Member Response.  Once notified of call-out by whatever 
means, negotiators so directed will respond immediately as directed with all 
required equipment.   

1. Required equipment will include the team member‘s: 

a) Police badge and identification card. 

b). Authorized handgun, either of on or off-duty type as appropriate. 

c). Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication. d). Portable radio. 

e). Flashlight. 

f). Cellular Telephone (if issued). 

g). Audio Recorder. 

h). Negotiator jacket or parka with ‗POLICE NEGOTIATOR‘ logo.   

i). Appropriate clothing for anticipated weather conditions.  Team 
members are recommended to keep their logo outerwear and/or foul 
weather gear in their assigned vehicles. 

2. Team members unable to respond for any reason when called out shall 
immediately notify Dispatch and the CNT /Special Operations Commander 
or another responding CNT member if the unit commander is unavailable.   

C. On-Duty Response to Incidents.  CNT team members who are on-duty are 
always available to respond to incidents where a full call-out procedure is not 
initiated.  CNT team members are encouraged to monitor the police radio and 
make their availability known to respond to incidents where their specialized 
training and skills could be utilized.  Many incidents may be resolved by the 
utilization of on-duty team members.   

D. CNT Incident Initiation.  Upon their arrival at an incident, CNT team 
members will immediately report to the Command Post or Command Van, as 
applicable, to contact the Incident Commander or the CNT /Special 
Operations commander if so designated, for detailed briefing and assignment.  
In the case of a lesser incident, the CNT team member will make contact with 
the scene Supervisor or First Responder.   

  

  

1. The first negotiator to arrive at an incident will receive a briefing by First 
Responders, witnesses, or any other parties with information on any 
aspect of the incident, to obtain a clear overview of the incident. 

2. The first responding negotiator, if time permits, or subsequently arriving 
negotiators as necessary, will ascertain where and tentatively by what 
means communications will be established, considering the nature and 
circumstances of the incident, and make recommendations to the Incident 
Commander if necessary regarding possible processes and strategy of the 
negotiations from the preliminary information then known.   

3. Subsequent team members shall report to the first negotiator, or 
negotiator team leader if present, for briefing and assignment to 
specialized duties during the incident. 

4. Team members will commence the duties of their specialized 
assignments when and as directed by the Incident Commander or 
designee and shall continue them until directed otherwise. 

5. The location and method used for establishing communications will be 
dependent on circumstances at hand, and may change as the incident 
progresses.   

a). Communications may be opened from any Command Post with or 
without the Command Van facilities. 

F. Outside-Agency Requests.  Requests for CNT assistance made by outside 
agencies may be honored after being referred to the Patrol division 
commander for review and approval.  Approval being granted, the 
CNT/Special Operations commander will cause the appropriate team 
members to be directed to respond to the incident location specified. 

1. CNT members so assigned will be guided by the CNT unit procedures 
in effect at the time for their operating instructions. 

2. Team members may work in conjunction with outside-agency CNT 
personnel, or as sole CNT personnel in an incident. 

a). If teamed with outside-agency CNT personnel, APD CNT members 
will abide by the policies and procedures of the agency in jurisdiction, 
unless such policies and procedure come into direct and serious 
conflict with current APD policy and procedure, or are in violation of 
any rule of law. 

b). If used as the sole CNT for any related duties in an incident, APD 
CNT members will be governed by APD policy and procedure.   

IV. CNT TEAM MEMBER DUTY ASSIGNMENTS 

A. Duty Assignment Selection.  Individual CNT team members are assigned 
specific, specialized duties during an incident dependent on the tactical and 
strategic requirements of the incident, and by the direction of the Incident 
Commander.   

  

Either the first negotiator or negotiator team leader, if designated, may assign 
specialized incident duties.  Team members are generally considered to be 
equally qualified to perform all of the duties of a negotiator. 

1. Normally, assignment to each specialized duty will be decided for each 
incident on a volunteer basis, with a consensus of the team members 
responding to that individual incident. 

2. An informal rotation of assignments will be maintained to assist all 
members in becoming equally proficient and experienced in all tasks. 

3. Operationally Sensitive/Not for Publication.  

4. Should disputes arise for any reason, assignments to duty shall be 
made by the negotiator team leader or first arriving negotiator if some 
urgency dictates. 

5. Assignment will not be based upon departmental position, unit seniority, 
or rank. 

The team assigned for an incident without SWAT will consist of a primary and 
secondary negotiator only, unless directed by the Incident Commander. 

V. CNT TEAM MEMBER SELECTION 

A. CNT Unit Staffing.  A minimum of eight (8), with a preference of twelve (12) 
officers and two (2) Supervisors shall be maintained as active CRU members 
both for adequate staffing of teams and to provide a sufficient relief pool of 
trained negotiators for call-outs of long duration. 

Recruitment for CNT will be opened as necessary for staffing requirements.  
A list of qualified applicants will be maintained for the following twelve month 
period. 

B. Selection Criteria.  The position of negotiator with CNT is strictly voluntary 
and is open to all sworn members of the Anchorage Police Department with a 
minimum of three years police experience.  Final selection for membership in 
CNT will be made by the Patrol division commander. C. Selection Process.  
Applicants will be required to make written application for membership in 
CNT; the application listing their qualifications, experience, reasons for their 
interest in the position, and why they feel their addition to CNT would benefit 
the unit.  All persons applying and otherwise qualified will be required to: 

1. Appear before an oral board composed of the Patrol commander and/or 
CNT commander, and at least two (2) serving CNT team members; the 
board striving to select the best candidate based upon: 

a). Experience. 

b). Communication skills. 

c). Prior training, if any. 

2. Pass a psychological examination limited to inquiry into their 
psychological fitness for the duties of negotiator.   

  

3. Other testing or evaluations as deemed necessary by the Special 
Operations Commander or CNT supervisor. 

D. Post-Selection Training.  All persons selected for CNT following the oral 
board and psychological examination will be required to pass a 40-hour 
formal training course in negotiations history and background.  

E. Team Member Recognition.  All serving CNT members are required to 
wear the current CNT insignia on their outer garments, excepting the 
negotiator jacket or parka unless desired, as directed by the general 
procedures manual.   

VI. CNT TRAINING/DEBRIEFING REQUIREMENTS 

A. CNT Training Schedule.  Training for CNT team members, past the original 
40-hour formal course for selection, will be held once every month.  Such unit 
training will consist of updates in procedures, discussions of incidents 
occurring in the interim involving CNT, and participatory scenarios including 
role-playing exercises. 

1. SWAT members and representatives of the mental-health profession 
will be encouraged to participate in CNT training sessions. 

2. On-going training will include analysis and reviewing of incident 
negotiations tape-recordings. 

B. Critical Incident Joint Exercises.  Joint-unit training exercises will be 
conducted on a yearly basis, including the Command staff, and all CNT, 
SWAT, and Mobile Command Post operators, to allow cohesive operations 
training between those units necessary for a critical incident.   

C. Attendance Requirement.  All team members are required to attend 
training sessions and debriefings by team and unit unless excused by the 
CNT supervisor or lead negotiator.  Unexcused failure to attend training could 
result in suspension from active participation in negotiation incidents until the 
next training session or possibly removal from the CNT entirely.   

D. Training Coordinator/Historian.  The CNT training coordinator/historian is 
responsible for coordinating and organizing each training session, as well as 
for keeping records on CNT activities and incidents.   

1. The training coordinator/historian will keep current the files on each 
team member, including records of training, and determine any additional 
training needs.   

2. The training coordinator/historian will solicit other team members to 
assist with the planning and organizing of training sessions. 

3. The training coordinator/historian will compile reports and negotiator‘s 
notes from CNT -involved incidents for the following debriefing and/or 
training session. 

  

4. Records of CNT team member training and experience will be 
maintained by the training coordinator/historian, with correct input into the 
team member‘s master training file in the departmental training section. 

E. Debriefing Requirements.  All CNT team members participating in incidents 
as negotiators will attend all post-incident debriefings both by team and jointly 
with SWAT, if applicable.  Additionally, team members will debrief following 
an incident: 

1. As a unit with all other CNT team members for the benefit of training 
and discussion at the next training session following the incident. 

2. An Incident Report form shall be completed for all incidents in which a 
CNT member is utilized in the capacity of a negotiator regardless of 
whether or not it is the result of a formal callout.  A copy shall then be 
forwarded to a CRU Supervisor and/or Special Operations commander for 
review, and then to the Patrol Commander.  Once reviewed by the 
Supervisor or Commander, it will be forwarded to the Training 
Coordinator/Historian for recording.

3.09.030 Traffic Unit Coordination 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

To advise all personnel of the proper method of coordinating traffic collision 
investigations with the Traffic Unit, by describing the Traffic Unit‘s role and its 
deployment standards and procedures. 
 

 
The Traffic Unit Supervisor will be notified of any collision resulting in a fatality. A 
Traffic Unit Collision Investigator may be called to any collision where there is 
serious physical injury and one or more drivers could be charged with a felony 
criminal offense, or to any collision where there is serious physical injury and 
where drugs/alcohol have or are suspected to have been used. The Traffic Unit 
will review all collisions involving serious physical injury and may assign follow up 
according to this procedure.  
 
The Traffic Unit may be called out in unusual circumstances with the approval of 
the Chain-of-Command.  
 
The Traffic Unit will be notified and the Traffic Unit will be called out for any 
collision that is a result of a police vehicular pursuit. 
 
Every effort will be used to utilize on-duty resources, however, if this cannot be 
accomplished, the Collision Investigator will request a Traffic Unit call out from 
the Traffic Supervisor. Traffic Unit officers will be called out on an ―as needed‖ 
basis to assist with the investigation. Unit call out will be conducted by the Traffic 
Unit Supervisor according to established unit procedures.  
 

DEFINITIONS 

  

 
Fatal collision- Any vehicle collision where one or more persons are immediately 
killed, or death appears to be imminent, as a result of the collision.

c.  A Traffic Unit callout will be initiated for collisions that are a result of a 

pursuit, unless the involved shift commander approves no callout being 
made. 

d.  Incidents involving a single vehicle, where the driver has died, may result in 
a full Traffic Unit callout, but will be evaluated on a case by case basis. A 
Collision Investigator may be sent to the scene to determine the extent of 
the investigation. 

e.  In collisions involving a fatality a Drug Recognition Expert will evaluate the 
drivers according to the DRE program‘s established protocol and training. 

f.  Fatal crashes involving wildlife, such as moose/vehicle collisions, may result 
in a full Traffic Unit callout. A Collision Investigator may be sent to the scene 
to determine the extent of the investigation. 

g.  The Collision Investigator who responds to the scene will be responsible for 

all follow up investigation related to these cases. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  

 

II.  Collisions Involving Serious Physical Injury 

a.  A Patrol Supervisor should respond to the scene and establish that the 

injury level meets the criteria of this procedure. If it does, the supervisor will 
then contact the Traffic Unit Supervisor who shall determine if a call out is 
necessary. If the criteria for call out are met, the Traffic Unit Supervisor will 
call out the Collision Investigator. 

b.  The Collision Investigator will respond to the scene and assess the 

resources to process the scene, interview witnesses, passengers and 
drivers. If the Collision Investigator determines the need for additional 
resources, or more technical assistance, they will contact the Traffic Unit 
Supervisor who may request additional Traffic Unit officers.

Unit will assume responsibility for the case and any related follow up. 
Patrol officers may be used to assist the Traffic Unit as needed.  

b.  Serious Physical Injury cases- 

i.  Once a Patrol Supervisor has established that the crash meets the 

criteria for a serious physical injury crash, on-duty Traffic Unit 
Officers should be dispatched to the scene and the Traffic Supervisor 
shall be notified. The Traffic Officers will be responsible for 
processing the scene until the Traffic Unit Supervisor has been 
notified of the crash and the Collision Investigator is detailed to the 
scene.  

VII.  Weather related crashes- 

a.  In extreme weather conditions where there is a large volume of collisions, 
such as the first snow day, Traffic Officers may be detailed to assist with 
collisions. The on-duty Patrol Supervisor shall notify the Traffic Unit

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.10.000  General Operations 

3.10.005  Automated External Defibrillators (AED) 

To advise all personnel of the approved method for use of the automated 
external defibrillators. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

That the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) be consistent with the 
principles of safe, expedient emergency care. 

I. AED EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT 

PROCEDURES 

A. AEDs will be distributed 24 hours per day.  In order to ensure constant 
distribution, officers shall follow the established guidelines. 

1. All AED trained and currently certified Officers shall obtain an AED at 
the beginning of each shift. 

2. Employees are responsible for ensuring their AED is fully stocked and 
that the supplies are not expired.  Employees will not open electrode 
packages except during patient treatment.  If there are deficiencies in the 
supplies, the employee shall notify their shift supervisor. 

3. The shift supervisor shall monitor distribution to confirm that all AEDs 
are distributed appropriately. 

4. Officers in possession of an AED shall return the AED at the end of shift 
to the designated storage area or deliver the AED to an officer assigned to 
the following shift. 

5. Each AED has a service due date.  In the event that the service due 
date is past due  and/or the low battery or service symbols are illuminated, 

  

the officer will deliver, or cause to be delivered, the AED to the radio shop 
and retrieve the AED as soon as the maintenance check is completed. 

6. Ensure the AED is kept within the heated area of the vehicle.  AEDs are 
not to be stored in the trunk during the winter months.  The AED must be 
maintained at room temperature (approximately 68 degrees) for one hour 
prior to use.  If temperatures outside are below room temperature, officers 
will ensure the vehicle maintains room temperature.  During winter 
months, officers who have a permanently assigned AED will ensure that 
the AED is protected from freezing when they are not on duty. 

II. AED USE 

A. Only trained employees will use the AED.  Responding employees will use 
AEDs in a manner consistent with American Heart Association training 
received from the Department.  AEDs will only be applied to patients, older 
than 12 months of age, who are unconscious, unresponsive, not breathing, 
have no signs of circulation (no pulse), and the employee has performed 5 
cycles of CPR. 

1. The only exception for the AED being applied before 5 cycles of CPR is, 
if the victim is older than 12 months, unconscious, unresponsive, not 
breathing, has no signs of circulation (no pulse), and the rescuer (who is a 
certified BLS Healthcare Provider) witnessed the victim collapse and the 
rescuer has an AED immediately available.  If all these criteria are met the 
AED can then be applied prior to the 5 cycles of CPR. 

2. If the AED pads cannot be placed in the correct position on the patient‘s 
body without overlapping, then the pads may be applied in the 
anterior/posterior position.  Do not use this method if the patient‘s 
circumference is so small that the pads overlap.  In this case, use CPR 
only. 

B. When two rescuers are available, and the situation allows it, one should 
provide airway management (breaths) and the other provide chest 
compressions.  After every 5 cycles, officers should switch roles. 

C. Upon receipt of the AED, the officer will: 

1. Ensure the service symbol (in the shape of a wrench) or low battery 
symbol are not illuminated.  It isn‘t necessary to turn on the AED to 
perform this check.   

2. Ensure the AED service due/inspection date has not passed. 

3. Ensure the AED is equipped with the following items: 

a). two sets of electrode patches 

b). one CPR mask 

c). one pair of scissors 

d). one cloth or gauze pad 

  

e). one disposable razor 

D. After any AED use (‗use‘ is defined as applying electrode patches and 
turning the AED on), the officer who used the AED shall: 

1. Attempt to replenish the used electrode patches from the Anchorage 
Fire Department employees. 

2. Completely document the circumstances of the AED application and/or 
use to include: 

a). The patient information 

b). The circumstances of the medical emergency 

c). Whether CPR was performed by any bystanders 

d). Whether no shock was advised and if a shock was advised, the 
number of shocks given 

e). If a shock was given and whether it had an effect on the patient 

f). Which hospital the patient was transported to for further care 

3. Notify a Supervisor of the AED use and coordinate the data retrieval 
from the AED.  This can be accomplished by placing a tag on the AED 
indicating the need for a download and a copy of the report attached to the 
AED.  An e-mail, providing notification of the use should also be sent by 
the officer to the AED control officer.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance

3.10.015  Cold Alert 

To advise all personnel of the elements of the Department‘s ―Cold Alert‖ 
program, and to instruct how it is implemented. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

The Department‘s primary responsibility of protection of life includes special 
awareness of the hazards of cold weather to those citizens who are incapacitated 
by poor health or chemical abuse.  This protection shall be in the form of actively 
seeking vulnerable populations and transporting them to warm shelter during 
periods of extreme cold. 

I. IMPLEMENTING A COLD ALERT 

PROCEDURE 

A. Temperature.  When the temperature or wind chill factor reaches 0 
degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius), the Anchorage Police Department 
will be placed on Cold Alert.  

B. Other Circumstances.  Nothing herein shall preclude the shift‘s highest 
ranking uniformed officer from initiating a Cold Alert for exigent 
circumstances, regardless of actual temperature or wind chill.  That person, 
however, is individually responsible for cancelling the Alert, and/or relaying all 
pertinent information to the oncoming shift. 

II. RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Dispatch Center‘s Responsibilities. 

1. The Dispatch Center shall, on its own initiative or by instruction from a 
shift supervisor, maintain contact with the National Weather Service to 
ascertain if the temperature or wind chill factor reaches 0 degrees 
Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius).  

  

2. The Dispatch Center shall broadcast over the main channels when Cold 
Alert standards are reached and obtain an acknowledgement from a shift 
supervisor. 

B. Shift Commander and/or Supervisors.  The highest ranking uniformed 
officer of the shift who becomes aware of conditions approaching Cold Alert 
standards shall: 

1. Notify or cause the notification of the Community Services Patrol, and 
request their assistance in placing any person(s) located.  

C. Patrol Officers Responsibilities.  Individual officers on regular patrol always 
have the responsibility of being alert to public safety issues, including 
protective custody when appropriate.  However, during a Cold Alert, the patrol 
must become more focused and intensive.  When advised of Cold Alert 
status, officers shall: 

1. Aggressively seek vulnerable populations exposed to the cold.  When 
found:  

a). If the person is not incapacitated, that person will be offered 
transportation to the Brother Francis Shelter (or other appropriate, 
designated shelter) if there is no other place for that person to go.  

b). If the person is incapacitated or unconscious, or if symptoms of 
hypothermia or other medical problems arise, that person shall be 
furnished medical attention.  If a medical determination is made that 
the subject is intoxicated only, then the officer shall take the subject 
into protective custody as delineated in AS 47.37.170 (see ―Protective 
Custody--Non-Criminal Commitment‖). 

III. CONTINUING AND TERMINATION OF A COLD ALERT 

A. Dispatch Center‘s Responsibilities. 

1. Dispatch Center will monitor temperatures through the National 
Weather Service and broadcast over main channels if the temperature 
rises above 0 degrees Fahrenheit, thus cancelling the cold alert status.  

2. Should the temperature remain colder than 0 degrees Fahrenheit 
throughout the shift, the Dispatch Center will enter the Cold Alert status on 
the daily bulletin to inform oncoming shift(s), as well a periodically re-
broadcast the Cold Alert Status.

3.10.020  Deaf/Hearing Impaired 

To advise all personnel of the options and facilities available when dealing with 
deaf or hearing impaired subjects. 

That persons who are deaf or hearing-impaired not have that handicap impede 
satisfactory communications with members of the Anchorage Police Department. 

A deaf or hearing-impaired person trying to relate emergency information to the 
police can be an especially stressful situation, both for that subject and the 
police.  Officers can help, however, by being familiar with the various options and 
facilities available to assist in communication.  This procedure is designed to aid 
the officer in dealing with a deaf or hearing-impaired person. 

TTY—Teletype:  Trade-named abbreviation for original telephone carried 
teletype messages. 

TDD:  Telecommunication Device for the Deaf. 

PROCEDURE 

I. IDENTIFICATION OF THE DEAF 

A. Indications.  Usually, a deaf person will indicate the handicap by pointing to 
his/her ears and/or shaking his/her head to indicate no understanding.  Often, 
a deaf person will reach into a pocket for paper and pencil. 

B. Verification of Deafness.  A deaf person will often carry identification 
showing membership in an organization for the deaf.  Relatives, friends, and 
ministry can help verify deafness if other methods fail. 

II. AREAS OF MISUNDERSTANDING/MISCONCEPTIONS 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

DEFINITIONS 

  

A. Officer Misinterpretations. 

1. The movement to get paper and pencil will be natural for that person.  
This can be misinterpreted by officers as a move for a weapon.  

2. A deaf person will normally nod in agreement, even though he/she 
might not understand what is being communicated.  Officers can 
accidentally ―lead‖ the conversation in this way. 

B. Misconceptions of the Deaf. 

1. Deaf people are rarely fluent in lip-reading and even the best can 
discern only about 1/3 of the words spoken.  Do not rely on this method for 
communication.  

2. Not all deaf people are mute, though most will have defective speech as 
a result of not being able to hear what they are saying.  True muteness is 
only when the physical apparatus for speech is defective. 

III. LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS AFFORDED THE DEAF 

A. Miranda Warnings.  If the criteria are met for requiring the Miranda 
warning, that warning must be communicated and understood by that person, 
regardless of deafness or other handicap/impediment.  When working with 
the deaf: 

1. Show the warnings in print--do not read them aloud.  

2. Indicate in writing that the warnings apply to anything written or 
communicated in any fashion. 

3. Ensure the subject is aware that interpretive services can be provided, 
either through his/her own attorney or through other facilities. 

B. Telephone Communications.  The deaf suspect, like any other, is entitled 
to communication with attorneys and, in some instances, with family and/or 
friends.  It is the officer‘s duty to provide reasonable opportunity for this, 
normally by either placing this call for the subject, or providing TTY/TDD 
telephones. 

C. Field Methods.  When officers encounter a deaf or hearing-impaired 
subject with whom communication is necessary, the following methods should 
be considered: 

1. Writing.  In the majority of cases, the subject will readily write the 
information sought, but at his/her own skill level. 

2. Signing.  Though several different sign languages exist, the American 
Manual Alphabet (finger spelling) is by far the most common.  For 
assistance in signing, officers should follow the procedure below: 

a). Contact the Dispatch Center to determine if any on-duty personnel 
are proficient in signing.  If there are none, then: 

b). Request the Dispatch Center research other available facilities, 
such as a volunteer call-out list, Crisis Line services, and the like. 

  

D. Telephonic Methods.  Officers should be aware that a method exists for 
deaf people to communicate by telephone.  This facility is known as "TTY" 
and "TDD" communications.  A person may call for police/fire/paramedics 
from a TTY or TDD telephone unit, and the person receiving the call will hear 
a distinct tone.  This alerts the call-taker that a TTY/TDD call is on line.  The 
machine receives typed-in messages, and call-takers can transmit typewritten 
responses.  Although the individual officer may not ever have occasion to use 
a TTY/TDD facility, this information may be helpful to relay to persons 
affected, yet unaware of these important facilities. 

IV. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS 

A. Interpreter Identification.  Officers should realize that a sign language 
interpreter must comply with a set of ethics.  The interpreter should keep all 
assignment-related information strictly confidential.  He/she should render the 
message faithfully, conveying the content and spirit of the speaker, and using 
language most readily understood by the person(s) whom they serve. 

Staff from the Center for Deaf Adults may be called for further assistance and 
services.  CDA staff can perform a broader role than sign language 
interpreters.  They can do a significant amount of explaining and 
paraphrasing, while the sign language interpreter has a strict duty to act as an 
utterly neutral agent.  Since questions of understanding rights and the like can 
surface, officers should fully identify the sign language interpreter and/or CDA 
staff used for possible testimony in court. 

B. Videotaping Interviews.  When circumstances allow, nothing precludes 
officers from videotaping interviews to achieve the equivalent of tape 
recording conventional interviews.

State of Alaska Rules of Evidence:  Article X, Writings 

PROCEDURES 

All personnel utilizing digital audio technologies shall be knowledgeable and 
proficient in accordance with standard operating procedures and the operation of 
the relevant digital audio technologies.  No employee shall make use of digital 
audio technology in which they cannot demonstrate proficiency.  No employee 
shall process any recording without following the established procedures for 
documentation and preservation of the processed recording.  The equipment 
user is responsible for having become sufficiently familiar with the equipment, 
instruction manuals, standard operating procedures, and APD Digital Audio 
Recording Policy to properly utilize and maintain the proper functioning of the 
equipment. 

Digital Audio training is required and will be coordinated through the Anchorage 
Police Department Information Technology Unit or other authorized personnel. 

When a digital audio recording device is used for evidentiary documentation, no 
options will be used to alter the recording in such a way that the recording does 
not accurately represent the subject of the recording or some aspect of the 
subject.  If digital options are needed and utilized for a specific purpose, which 
cause the recording to be distorted in some fashion, that specific purpose and 
the effect of utilizing the digital option must be documented.  

A.  Preserving Original:  Each original recording captured during an 
investigation, at a crime scene or contact with the public shall be 
preserved; regardless as to whether an error in procedures may have 
caused the recording to be taken inadvertently or in a manner that causes 

 

  

it to be valueless.  Any recording that an officer determines to not be part 
of a criminal investigation must be submitted to the DIMS generic folder 
assigned to the officer.  No recording will be deleted prior to submitting it 
into the digital evidence system. 

Once the file has been archived, the chain of custody shall document the 
identity of the individuals and groups who had custody and control of the 
archive recording.   

NOTE: Once recorded, it will be down loaded.  No deletions from the 
recorder are allowed until all contents are downloaded successfully. 

B.  Condition of recording:  The original recording will be stored and 

maintained in an unaltered state.  This includes maintaining original digital 
recordings in their native file formats.  Duplicates or copies will be used for 
working recordings when applicable and as authorized by the chain of 
command.  All edits must be documented with stated purpose.  The 
original will be available as needed.  No original recording will be altered in 
any way from how it was captured and will stay in the same digital format 
as it was captured.  

C.  Timely Submission:  Audio Recordings shall be submitted, like all 

evidence, prior to the completion of the officer‘s shift, including overtime 
and extra detail shifts. 

Once the audio recordings have been submitted as evidence or non-
evidence,  a copy of the audio recording shall be maintained on the 
officer‘s work computer for six (6) months unless the downloading officer 
takes specific steps to assure that proper submission has occurred.   

In the case of off duty contact tapes, supervisor authorization is required 
to incur overtime to accomplish the download.  Otherwise, down load of 
the audio recording is required within three (3) days or the first shift back 
to work. 

When the audio recording is properly downloaded, clear the recorder. 

The saving of digital voice recordings will be clearly noted in the 
associated police report. 

D.  Storage and retrieval: Digital Audio Recordings will be saved to the Digital 
Evidence server maintained by the Information Technology unit.  Officers 
will follow the steps outlined in the system for storage and verification of 
the audio file before final submission to the system. 

When audio file copies  are required for court, etc, the Evidence unit 
personnel will provide copies as requested. 

E.  Verification of Original and Processed Recordings:  Personnel who 

captured the original recording or were present at the time the original 
recording was captured will verify that the recording is a true and accurate 
representation for court purposes. 

  

F.  Retention: The Property and Evidence Unit will be responsible for 

maintaining the infrastructure that preserves the evidentiary files and 
documents the chain of custody, with the assistance of the Information 
Technology unit. 

Files will be stored on the server for the same length of time as physical 
evidence is maintained following retention and disposal procedures 
adopted by APD.  Periodically, as determined by the level of the 
technology used, the files will be converted to a long term storage media 
and will be stored by property and evidence.  

G.  Guidelines for Software:  The purchase of all software will be vetted 

through the Information Technology Unit.

3.10.035  Diplomatic Immunity and Consular Notification for Foreign 
Nationals 

To provide guidance to officers who come in contact with foreign nationals during 
the performance of their official duties. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

The Anchorage Police Department will make every reasonable effort to abide by 
the terms and conditions ratified by the Vienna Convention on Consular 
Relations concerning the arrests, detentions and deaths of foreign nationals and 
the appointment of guardians for minors or incompetent adults who are foreign 
nationals. 

DEFINITIONS 

Foreign National: An individual who is a citizen of any country other than the 
United States. (U.S. Department of Homeland Security) 

DISCUSSION 

These treaty obligations are the law of the land under the Supremacy Clause of 
the U.S. Constitution. Consular notification requirements and conditions of 
Diplomatic Immunity also apply to American citizens living and traveling abroad.  
Therefore, officers should treat foreign nationals as we would want an American 
citizen to be treated in a similar situation in a foreign country.  This means prompt 
notification to the foreign national of the possibility of consular assistance, and 
prompt notification to the foreign national‘s nearest consular officials so that they 
may provide whatever consular services they deem appropriate.  Therefore, 
when officers are presented with situations involving persons who may fall into 
one of the above mentioned categories, reasonable efforts must be made to 
investigate that person‘s citizenship. 

PROCEDURES 

  

I. DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY 

A. When a person with known or potential diplomatic immunity is 
encountered, employees shall notify their supervisor as soon as possible. 

B. Foreign nationals with diplomatic immunity are issued an official 
Identification Card by the Department of State. 

1. The degree of immunity is detailed on the back of the ID card.  Police 
employees should be sure to read and document the degree of immunity 
granted prior to taking further action.  It is important to note that not all 
foreign nationals are granted FULL immunity from detention, arrest and/or 
prosecution. 

2. Additionally, supervisors should contact the Department of State to 
verify the immunity status of the foreign national and seek further 
guidance. 

C. When a foreign national with full diplomatic immunity is involved and the 
safety of the public is in imminent danger or it is apparent that a grave crime 
may otherwise be committed, police authorities may intervene to the extent 
necessary to halt such activity. 

This intervention may include use of force and/or arrest if otherwise justified 
according to existing policy.  The Department of State must be contacted 
immediately in these cases. 

Foreign nationals may be stopped for investigation (Terry Stop) or stopped 
and cited for traffic violations regardless of their diplomatic immunity. 

1. A traffic stop is not considered to be an arrest or detention as it relates 
to diplomatic immunity. 

2. If the officer determines the individual is too impaired to drive safely, the 
officer should not permit the individual to continue to drive (even in the 
case of diplomatic agents).  Immunity may not prevent Diplomats from 
certain administrative actions, such as vehicle impoundment. 

D. When a foreign national with full or any other level of diplomatic immunity 
is suspected of committing a crime, obtain as much information as possible 
during the initial investigation and thoroughly document it in a Police Report.  
Then, a supervisor shall contact the U.S. Department of State for assistance. 

II. CONSULAR NOTIFICATION 

A. General Guidelines: The arresting officer must first determine the foreign 
national‘s country of origin.  In the absence of other information, officers 
should assume this is the country listed on the passport or other travel 
documents held by the foreign national.  If the foreign national‘s country is not 
on the mandatory notification list, (*see below) officers should offer to the 
foreign national without delay, to contact his or her consular official.  This 
should be done as soon as practical following the arrest/detention. 

  

1. Officers will advise the arrested/detained foreign national of the 
following: 

―As a non-U.S. citizen who is being arrested or detained, you are entitled to have 
us notify your country‘s consular officers here in the United States of your 
situation. You are also entitled to communicate with your consular officers. A 
consular officer may be able to help you obtain legal representation, and may 
contact your family and visit you in detention, among other things. If you want us 
to notify your consular officers, you can request this notification now, or at any 
time in the future. Do you want us to notify your consular officers at this time?‖1[1] 

2. The advisement will be audio-recorded on digital media and 
documented by requiring the arrested/detained subject to indicate his/her 
choice.  Officers will then document the request in a police report. 

3. Depending on the circumstances, a qualified interpreter may be used 
with non-English speaking or hearing impaired individuals. 

4. Officers should advise the booking officer (or similar staff) at the place 
of detention or medical facility of the person‘s status. 

B. Notification Requested by Detainee:  If the arrestee/detainee does not 
want his consular officials notified, do not inform the consulate, but do make a 
note in the detainee‘s file.  If the arrestee/detainee requests notification, a 
supervisor will contact the nearest consular official ―without delay‖ to make 
the notification.  The Dispatch Center Supervisor will assist in this. Updated 
contact information can be found on the Department of State‘s website at: 
http://travel.state.gov/law/notify.html. Dispatch Center Supervisors will 
maintain current contact numbers in order to facilitate these notifications. 

1. The State Department defines ―without delay‖ to mean there should be 
no deliberate delay and notification should occur as soon as reasonably 
possible under the circumstances. 

2. To make the notification, Dispatch Supervisors will use the suggested 
fax sheet provided by the Department of State‘s ―Consular Notification and 
Access‖ publication.  A copy will be attached to the police report. 

C. Mandatory Notification:  In some cases, the nearest consular officials must 
be notified ―without delay‖ of the arrest or detention of a foreign national, in 
some cases it is mandatory, regardless of the national‘s wishes.  These 
mandatory notifications must also be made without delay. 

D. Officers arresting/detaining foreign nationals in cases of mandatory 
notification will advise the subject: 

―Because of your nationality, we are required to notify your country‘s consular 
officers here in the United States that you have been arrested or detained. We 
will do this as soon as possible. In addition, you are entitled to communicate with 

                                                 
1[1] Recommended Advisement, Bureau of Consular Affairs, United States Department of State, 
Summer 2004. 

  

your consular officers. You are not required to accept their assistance, but your 
consular officers may be able to help you obtain legal representation, and may 
contact your family and visit you in detention, among other things.‖1 

E. The list of countries that require mandatory notification to consular officials 
when one of their citizens is arrested/detained is extensive.  To make this 
determination, officers should seek assistance from the Dispatch Supervisor 
or other resources. 

F. Death of Foreign Nationals:  Consular officials must be notified when a 
government official becomes aware of a death of a foreign national.  This 
notification will permit the foreign government to make an official record of the 
death for its own legal purposes.  Such notice will help ensure that passports 
and other legal documentation issued by that country are canceled and not 
reissued to fraudulent claimants.  In addition, it may help ensure that the 
foreign national‘s family and legal heirs, if any, are aware of the death. 

G. Guardian and/or Trustee Issues:  Consular officials must be notified when 
a court considers appointing a guardian or trustee with respect to a foreign 
national minor or an individual who is incompetent.  The legal procedures for 
appointment of a guardian or trustee can proceed but the consular authorities 
should be permitted to express any interest their government might have in 
the issue. 

H. Other circumstances:  The Department of State can provide further 
guidance on any issues regarding consular notification and access 
procedures. During normal business hours, officers may call (202) 647-4415. 
After hours and on weekends and holidays, officers should call the State 
Department Operations Center at (202) 647-1512.  The Department‘s email 
address is consnot@state.gov.  Additional information and training materials 
are available on the Department‘s website at: 
http://travel.state.gov/law/notify.html.  

III. REQUIRED REPORTING 

A. The Anchorage Police Department will maintain records and reports in 
relation to notification requirements. It will be the responsibility of the arresting 
officer to write a report containing the following information: 

1. All information pertaining to a Diplomat‘s station, immunity and 
identification. 

2. All notifications to foreign consular representatives including name, 
date, and time. 

3. In cases where notification is not mandatory, information should be 
recorded to indicate that the foreign national was informed of the option of 
consular notification, the date and time the foreign national was informed, 
and whether or not the foreign national requested that consular officials be 
notified.  In addition, all notifications to foreign consular representatives 
including name, date, and time must be documented. 

  

4. If a confirmation of receipt of notification is returned by the consular 
representative, it should be attached to the incident report.

3.10.040  Drug Endangered Children 

The purpose of this policy is to instruct all members of the Anchorage Police 
Department on the procedures regarding the investigation of drug-endangered 
children. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

The policy of the Anchorage Police Department is to thoroughly identify and 
investigate cases involving Drug Endangered Children (DEC) and to ensure 
successful prosecution of those who place these children in harm‘s way. 

The protocol outlines two different levels of response by the Anchorage Police 
Department and is coordinated with efforts from the Office of Children‘s Services 
(OCS), as well as medical staff, the District Attorney‘s Office, and the Office of 
the Attorney General.   

A Level I response is mandated for cases involving a drug lab.  A lower, Level II 
response is designed for cases in which the risk of exposure to the child is 
considered to be less acute.   

The focus of the Anchorage Police Department law enforcement officer is to 
collect evidence for purposes of criminal prosecution and ensure the safety and 
well-being of those present.  The investigating officer/detective will be 
responsible for the evidence collection relative to the controlled substances, child 
endangerment, living conditions, health hazards, firearm violations, and other 
relevant crimes.   

A Crimes Against Children detective will conduct the forensic interview of the 
child victim to establish the elements of child abuse and to conduct the child 
crimes investigation.   

The Records division is responsible for ensuring all DEC reports are delivered to 
OCS for review.  An electronic copy will be delivered to OCS via Packetwriter 
Report Distribution Manager (RDM). 

  

DISCUSSION 

Innocent children are sometimes found in environments where 
methamphetamine and other illegal substances are produced, sold, or used.  
This exposure can harm anyone, but is particularly dangerous to children.  The 
dangers include chemical contamination, fire and explosions, child abuse and 
neglect, hazardous living conditions, and other social problems.   

One of the greatest dangers of a methamphetamine lab is contamination.  
Contamination can occur in a number of ways- through the skin, soiled clothing; 
household items used in the lab, second hand smoke and ingestion.  Children 
living in methamphetamine labs are more likely than adults to absorb more of the 
chemicals into their bodies because of their size, and higher rates of metabolism 
and respiration. 

Many methamphetamine labs are discovered as a result of fires or explosions.  
Young children are less likely than adults to escape from or survive a 
methamphetamine lab related fire or explosion due to their age, lack of mobility, 
and the fact that their caretakers are often under the influence of controlled 
substances. 

The presence of methamphetamine manufacturing is often accompanied by 
increased risk of other problems such as domestic violence; severe physical 
neglect, (i.e. lack of food, medical and dental care and appropriate supervision); 
emotional neglect, and physical and sexual abuse.  Many children who live in 
drug labs are also exposed to pornographic material and overt sexual activity. 

Hazardous living conditions and filth are common in home-based drug labs.  
Rotten food, used needles, dirty clothes and dishes, animal feces, and drug 
paraphernalia such as razor blades, needles, and pipes are often within a child‘s 
reach. 

Holding adults criminally accountable for Drug Endangered Children is extremely 
important as an initial deterrent to these actions.  Criminal accountability is best 
achieved through successful investigation and prosecution of child abuse 
charges.  To that end, the development of standardized investigations and 
evidence gathering protocols should be established for use. 

The investigating police officer shall document, photograph, and report the 
evidence of DEC for purposes of criminal prosecution.  The investigating officer 
should also ensure that OCS is contacted, in situations where it is warranted (a 
Level I response,) responds to take custody of the child for purposes of a medical 
exam and to determine placement of the child.  In situations where an immediate 
danger to the health and well-being of the child is not evident (a Level II 
response,) the investigating officer shall write and turn in a police report to OCS, 
CACU, and the Drug Enforcement Unit.  This report will be forward electronically 
via Packetwriter Report Distribution Manager (RDM) system. 

Level I Response:  Children who live in or frequent clandestine drug laboratories 
or other drug manufacturing operations.  The highest priority of this response is 

DEFINITIONS 

  

to determine and address the acute health and safety concerns of children as a 
result of exposure to drugs, toxic chemicals, and physical or sexual abuse. 

Level II Response:  Children exposed to the sale, use or possession of controlled 
substances.  Although the same priorities and concerns as Level I DEC exist, the 
urgency may be diminished. 

Child Abuse:  The physical injury or neglect, mental injury, sexual abuse, sexual 
exploitation, or maltreatment of a child under the age of 18 by a person under 
circumstances that indicate that the child‘s health or welfare is harmed or 
threatened. 

Child Neglect:  Means the failure of a person responsible for the child‘s welfare to 
provide necessary food, care, clothing, shelter, or medical attention for a child. 

Drug Endangered Child:  A child who is exposed to an environment where adults 
are manufacturing, selling, or using drugs.

PROCEDURE 

I. LAW ENFORCEMENT LEVEL I RESPONSE: 

A. Patrol Officer‘s Responsibilities: 

1. Secure the scene and ensure the safety of the initial responders and 
civilians present while attempting to preserve evidence. 

2. Together with EMS and OCS, assess children for signs of obvious 
injury or illness and the necessity for immediate gross decontamination 
prior to transport to the hospital for emergency care. 

  

a). If children are in acute medical distress, emergency 
decontamination shall be performed by the responding EMS personnel 
to the extent necessary for EMS transport, with due regard to the 
physical and emotional effects such decontamination will have on the 
children. 

3. Officers should recognize that in some cases, older children may also 
have some culpability in the crime.  Possible charges against a minor in 
the juvenile justice system may impact the application of this protocol. 

B. Patrol Supervisor‘s Responsibilities: 

1. Notify the Drug Unit Supervisor, if not already involved, who shall 
initiate a Drug detective call-out for a DEC investigation. 

2. Notify a Crimes Against Children (CACU) supervisor of the need to 
initiate a CACU detective call-out. 

C. Drug Unit Supervisor Responsibilities: 

1. Initiate a Drug investigator call-out to begin a DEC investigation. 

2. When possible, notify an OCS intake supervisor in advance of serving a 
warrant on a lab where children are known to have been present.  If this is 
not done, contact OCS and request that a caseworker respond to the 
scene at the time the warrant is served, bearing in mind that non-law 
enforcement personnel will not be allowed into a crime scene. 

D. Drug Investigator Responsibilities: 

1. Examine the scene for evidence that indicates the presence of children. 

2. Take measurements comparing the height and reach of the children in 
relation to the location of the lab items and chemicals/equipment. 

3. Document and video or photograph the scene giving particular attention to 
the following risk factors: 

a). Children‘s accessibility to drugs, chemicals, syringes, and drug 
paraphernalia 

b). Proximity of hazards to children‘s play and sleep areas 

c). Non-drug hazards and other indications of neglect 

d). Access to pornography 

e). Access to weapons 

f). Food quantity and quality 

g). Sleeping conditions 

h). Sanitary conditions 

i). Swab a sample of child-accessible areas for drug contamination 

4. Photograph the children at the scene and document the following: 

  

a). Injuries 

b). Cleanliness and dress 

c). Signs of neglect 

5. Interview neighbors and other witnesses 

E. Crimes Against Children Supervisor Responsibilities: 

1. Initiate a CACU Detective call-out if applicable 

F. Crimes Against Children Investigator Responsibilities: 

1. Interview the children 

2. Collection of evidence during medical evaluation of the children 

3. Assist OCS, if necessary, with placement of the children 

II. LAW ENFORCEMENT LEVEL II RESPONSE 

A. Patrol Officer‘s Responsibilities: 

1. Request EMS if children have obvious injuries or illness. 

2. Evaluate the children‘s access to controlled substances, physical 
condition, and the level of care being provided.  If emergency placement is 
necessary, placement of the child is to be coordinated through OCS- the 
child will not be released to a relative or guardian without authorization 
from OCS. 

3. Write a police report classified Drug Endangered Children to be 
forwarded for screening by OCS (This report will be forwarded to OCS via 
Packetwriter Report Distribution Manager- RDM).  This should be done 
even if the children are not currently present in the home, but there are 
indications that children live there. 

a). The detail of the police report, should include but not be limited to: 

i. The description of the reported address 

ii. The number, identity, and/or descriptions of responsible adults in 
the residence 

iii. The number, identity, and/or descriptions of the endangered 
children 

iv. The presence and frequency of chemical odors 

v. Chemicals observed at the location and their accessibility to 
children 

vi. Specific observations of drug activity 

vii. Information concerning the presence of weapons 

viii. Any other dangers observed by the reporting party 

B. Record‘s Supervisor Responsibilities:

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.10.045  Gang Intelligence 

This policy provides guidelines for identification, classification, validation, 
intelligence storage, and purge criteria for gangs, and gang members.  This 
policy designates a chain-of-command for the Intelligence Unit. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

Information regarding gang members or gang associates who are reasonably 
suspected of being involved in criminal activity will be submitted and maintained 
in the Crimintel Gang Database, which is hosted and maintained by the State 
Law Enforcement Intelligence Center (SLEIC).  All police reports and FI cards 
that are gang related will be forwarded to the Intelligence Unit.  The Intelligence 
Unit will then complete a Gang Validation Card for each individual suspected of 
being a gang member/gang associate and entered into the APD Filemaker Pro, 
―Gang Validation Card‖ database.  After a gang or gang member/associate is 
validated the gang or gang member/associate will be added into the SLEIC State 
wide system for access by other participating agencies.  All entries into this 
system will be done by an Intelligence Unit/Gang Specialist who has attended 
CFR 28 part 23 training and has been approved by the Chief of Police and will 
ensure information provided to the database is compliant with Title 28 CFR Part 
23.  The Intelligence Unit (IU) personnel who have attended CFR 28 part 23 
training and have been approved by the Chief of Police will input information and 
all individuals classified as a gang member/gang associate into the Crimintel 
Gang Database.  IU personnel who have attended CFR 28 part 23 training will be 
the only designated classifiers for this information.  Only IU personnel will have 
direct access to the Gang Intelligence Files stored in the IU office.  All other 
authorized users who have attended CFR 28 part 23 training and have been 
approved by the Chief of Police will have access to gang information stored in 
Crimintel for viewing purposes only. 

DEFINITIONS 

  

Gang:  A group of three or more persons who have in common a name or 
identifying sign, symbol, tattoo or other physical marking, or style of dress; and 
whose members individually or collectively are reasonably suspected of 
involvement in, or are planning to become involved in, a pattern of criminal 
activity.  Any group including outlaw motorcycle gangs, prison gangs, posses, 
taggers, party crews, car clubs, clicks, subversive groups and their associated 
membership can qualify under the definition of a gang and may be maintained in 
the gang intelligence files. 

Set:  A set, sometimes referred to as an umbrella group, is an association of 
multiple gangs.  Sets are based on ideological similarities and sometimes 
geographic regions as well.  Crips, Bloods, Folk Nation, and People Nation are 
all examples of Sets or umbrella groups. 

Gang Member:  A juvenile or adult who has been identified and documented as 
an active participant in a gang by IU personnel under the Department approved 
criteria requirements. 

Gang Associate:  A juvenile or adult who has been identified and documented by 
IU personnel as one who associates with a gang and is involved in its criminal 
activity, but is not necessarily identified or recognized as a full member. 

Reasonable Suspicion:  Reasonable suspicion is established when information 
exists which establishes sufficient facts to give a trained law enforcement or 
criminal investigative agency officer, investigator, or employee a basis to believe 
that there is a reasonable possibility that an individual or organization is involved 
in a definable criminal activity or enterprise (28 CFR Part 23).  28 CFR 23.3(b) 
(3) states that criminal intelligence information that can be put into a criminal 
intelligence sharing system is "information relevant to the identification of and the 
criminal activity engaged in by an individual who or organization which is 
reasonably suspected of involvement in criminal activity, and meets criminal 
intelligence system submission criteria.  Further, 28 CFR 23.20(a) states that a 
system shall only collect information on an individual if "there is reasonable 
suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal conduct or activity and the 
information is relevant to that criminal conduct or activity."  28 CFR 23.20(b) 
extends that limitation to collecting information on groups and corporate entities. 

Gang Specialist Officer:  An officer or detective assigned as a specialist in gang 
investigations and has attended a gang investigation course and has attended 28 
CFR Part 23 training or has comparable, practical experience from previous 
assignments. 

Gang Related Crime:  Crimes in which the suspect or victim is a gang member or 
gang associate, or when the crime is consistent with gang activity based on the 
surrounding circumstances.  This may include, but not limited to incidents when: 

1. Suspect or victim has a gang tattoo(s) 
2. Suspect or victim has a gang moniker 
3. A statement indicating gang involvement was made 
4. The suspect or victim demonstrated gang behavior, or 
5. Multiple suspects and gang modus operandi (MO) were involved.  

  

A Gang Specialist Officer, along with the IU, shall approve the gang-related crime 
classification.  In the rare circumstance when the classification cannot be 
determined at this level, the chain of command will be a designated Lieutenant, 
the Captain of Patrol and/or Detectives, and then the Deputy Chief of Operations 
to make the final determination. 

Gang Motivated Crime:  Any crime committed at the direction of, for the benefit 
of, or in association with a street gang. 

I. GAND VALIDATION PROCEDURE 

PROCEDURE 

A. Police Reports and FI Cards:  The IU will review all gang related Police 
Reports and FI cards. Once an FI card(s) or Police Report(s) on an individual 
has been received and there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is 
involved in gang activity a Gang Validation Card will be activated.  This card 
is generated from the Filemaker Pro, ―Gang Validation Card‖ database.  This 
card will be used to validate an individual‘s status as a gang member/gang 
associate. 

B. Completion:  Completion for this card will be tasked to the IU.  The IU will 
initiate this card once an FI card or Police Report on an individual has been 
received and there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is involved in 
gang activity.  Future FI cards, police reports, or information obtained from 
other law enforcement agencies on the individual will be used to update the 
Gang Validation Card. 

C. Time to Complete:  The IU will have 2 years to validate the card from the 
date the card was initiated. 

D. Validation:  All Police Reports and FI cards which are gang-related will be 
reviewed by the gang specialist officer for verification, classification, and 
validation.  The IU Commander will sign all validation cards in the space 
provided once gang membership or association by an individual has met the 
validation criteria (described in section E). 

E. Distribution:  Printed copy, filed in the IU‘s files.  The validated gang or 
gang member/associate will then be submitted to the state wide SLEIC 
database by an IU Officer, designated by the Deputy Chief of Operations, 
who has attended 28 CFR Part 23 training. 

II. GANG-RELATED STATISTICAL CRIMES 
The following is a list of crimes which will be monitored statistically by the 
Department to assess the level of gang crime in the area: 
AS 11.41 series (Offenses Against the Person) 
AS 11.46 series (Offenses Against Property); or any felony offense 
Crime Classifications will be divided into two categories (see definitions) 

1. Gang Related 

2. Gang Motivated 

III. GANG VALIDATION FILE 

  

A. The Gang Validation File will consist of gang validation cards and 
individual photos (if available).  Related reports which are deemed necessary 
to keep in hard copy format can be stored in the file as well. 

B. The APD Gang Validation file will be the only Department-authorized 
hardcopy file that contains detailed information which establishes an 
individual‘s gang membership or association. 

C. All APD Gang Validation Card hard copies will be maintained and secured 
in the IU office by the assigned personnel. 

IV. CRITERIA FOR GANG MEMBER/GANG ASSOCIATION VALIDATION 

A. The following criteria have been established for identifying an individual as 
a gang member or gang associate. 

1. Indicators of gang membership: 

a). Individual admits to criminal gang membership at the time of arrest 
or incarceration 

b). Individual admits to being a gang member in a non-custodial 
situation 

c). Individual has been identified as a gang member by a reliable 
informant or source 

d). Individual has been identified as a gang member by an untested 
informant or source with corroboration 

e). Individual has been seen displaying gang hand signs or symbols 

f). Individual has gang tattoos 

g). Individual openly associates with documented gang members 

h). Individual has been arrested, alone or with known gang members, 
for a crime consistent with gang activity 

i). Possesses documents, which contain gang style literature, symbols, 
or pictures 

2. Self-Admission Criteria:  a or b is sufficient enough to validate the 
individual as a gang member if the gang/group the individual is admitting 
to have been validated by the APD IU as a gang and there is a reasonable 
suspicion the individual is involved in gang activity.  If the group is 
classified as a gang at a later date (not to exceed the allowable 2 years to 
validate individual) by the IU, any individuals who admitted membership to 
this gang can then be validated as gang members. 

3. Gang Membership Criteria:  When two or more of these criteria are met 
and there is a reasonable suspicion of gang involvement, the IU will 
validate the individual on a Gang validation card as an active member of a 
specific gang.  The criteria can be cumulative over time, a maximum of 2 
years. 

  

4. Gang Associate Criteria:  When an individual meets at least one of the 
above criteria and is linked to a documented gang member, he/she may 
be designated as a gang associate provided the individual is reasonably 
suspected of involvement in the criminal activity of the gang 

5. State-hosted Gang database for APD:  The state-hosted database 
came on line in early 2006. It resides at 
http://sleic.dps.state.ak.us/crimintel/.  A user name/password is required. 
Gang-related police reports will be entered into the APD Gang database, 
which will be known as Crimintel.  Crimintel will be utilized to assist in 
validation of street gangs, gang members and gang associates. 

V. INTELLIGENCE UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. The accuracy of the state-hosted Crimintel is based entirely on the 
accuracy and the timeliness of the information entered into it.  The IU will: 

1. Confirm information on FI cards or police reports before classifying 
anyone as gang members/gang associates as per APD policy and 
applicable state law; 

2. Input, update records and remove outdated records in Crimintel; 

3. Enter gang-related police reports and FI cards into the Crimintel 
database; 

4. Add suspected gang members and gang associates into the APD 
Filemaker Pro, ―Gang Validation Card‖ database for possible validation. 
Ensure information provided to the database is compliant with Title 28, 
CFR Part 23; 

5. Add suspected street gangs into the APD Filemaker Pro, ―Gang 
Validation Card‖ database for possible validation; 

6. Assist Gang Specialists, SRO‘s, and Detectives by providing gang 
related investigative leads; 

7. Provide periodic updates to patrol during fall-outs; 

8. Provide periodic training for officers/detectives concerning gang 
intelligence and the Department gang policy. Gang Intelligence personnel 
will use verbal, visual displays (i.e. maps, posters), and multimedia 
methods to conduct training; 

9. Coordinate with outside agencies (i.e. probations, corrections) facilities 
for updates and new information on gangs; 

10. Maintain an Intelligence Library consisting of manuals, periodical, 
publications, photos, training videos/DVDs, etc; 

11. Compile periodic gang crime statistics; 

12. Provide community presentations on gang topic using general 
information which has been approved by the unit supervisor. 

VI. CONTACTS WITH GANG MEMBERS 

  

A. Investigations and Arrests:  When the arrest or preliminary investigation 
reveals that the crime is possibly gang-related, the reporting officer will write 
―Gang-Related‖ on the front of the arrest report or incident report.  The 
investigating officer will ensure that the narrative fully explains the rationale 
for determining that the arrest or investigation is possibly gang related.  
Further, if an officer/detective has reasonable suspicion to believe possible 
gang involvement by any individual contacted during the course of an 
investigation, the officer/detective should write ―gang membership‖ in the 
―suspected of‖ field- i.e. under the ―Additional Name Report‖.  Suspected 
gang membership information should be further investigated by contacting a 
gang specialist. 

B. Field Identification:  Officers who contact a suspected gang member or 
gang associate and determine that the completion of a FI Card or police 
report is appropriate, will document the following additional information: 

1. Approved criteria for suspecting gang involvement (i.e., admits to gang 
membership, tattoos, attire, etc) 

2. The specific type of gang activity involved and 

3. The words ―POSSIBLE MEMBER‖ or ―POSSIBLE ASSOCIATE‖ in the 
narrative portion of the FI Card or police reports, based on the criteria 
documented by the officer.  Note:  Only IU/ gang specialist personnel who 
have attended CFR 28 part 23 training and have been approved by the 
Chief of Police will enter gang information into Crimintel.  This assures 
quality control, security, and uniformity. 

VII. MAINTAINING INTEL UNIT GANG FILES 

A. Crimintel:  The IU / Gang Specialist Officers who have attended CFR 28 
part 23 training and have been approved by the Chief of Police will be 
responsible for submitting those subjects who have met 28 CFR Part 23 
submission criteria.  The Intelligence Unit will be responsible for maintaining 
compliance with 28 CFR Part 23. Under 28 CFR Part 23.20 (g), information 
shall be labeled to indicate levels of sensitivity, levels of confidence, and the 
identity of submitting agencies and control officials. 

B. Hard Copy Files:  Hard copy files refer to gang history books, 
organizational charts and gang photograph books.  These files contain 
information on street gangs, their members and affiliates who are, have been, 
or are likely to be involved in criminal activity and shall only be possessed 
outside the IU by personnel authorized by the Deputy Chief of Operations.  A 
document sign out log will be completed by that person and that log will be 
maintained in the secure Intel Office. 

C. Hard Copy File Organization:  The Department hard copy files will be 
organized as follows:  

1. The Gang Validation Card can be attached with a current photograph of 
the gang member/ gang associate if available. 

  

2. The Gang Validation Cards will be filed in alphabetical order. 

3 In addition, a file for each gang will be maintained. In this file, a listing of 
all current members will be listed.  This will be updated as new members 
are identified to their respective gangs. 

4 Validation Cards will be kept on file for a maximum of 5 years from the 
most recent entry of validating information, i.e. information which 
illustrates continued gang activity by the subject. 

D. Gang Associated Reports:  Reports which involve gang related or 
motivated activity should be forwarded to the IU by the investigating officer 
and/or classifying. 

E. Gang Validation Card Completion:  The IU will list all available identifying 
information on the suspected gang member/gang associate.  All applicable 
validation criteria boxes will be checked.  Detailed information on tattoos, 
graffiti, and clothing will be provided.  Explanations for each applicable check 
mark will be written in the space provided below the area.  The IU 
Commander will sign and date the card in the space provided. 

F. Updating Gang Validation Cards:  Each gang member/gang associate will 
have a Gang Validation Card in the Intel files.  Any and all FI cards and Police 
Reports on an individual which already has a Validation Card on file will be 
used to update the Gang Validation Card with any new or different 
information.  The new information will then be updated in Crimintel. 

VIII. CRIMINTEL AND GANG FILE SECURITY 

A. Confidentiality:  All Department personnel are reminded that it is not a 
crime in and of itself to be a gang member.  It is the responsibility of everyone 
in the Department to protect the confidentiality of Crimintel and the 
Department gang files, and to safeguard the Constitutional rights of those 
identified.  As such, access to hard copy gang files will be restricted to the IU 
and Gang Specialist Officers as well as personnel who have met the ―need to 
know, right to know‖ criteria.  Furthermore, only the IU personnel who have 
attended CFR 28 part 23 training and have been approved by the Chief of 
Police will be able to add, update, and delete information in the Crimintel 
database. 

B. Retrieval of System Files and Photocopies:  Printouts and/or copies of 
gang validation cards shall not be used as addenda‘s to reports (e.g., search 
warrants, arrest warrants, etc.).  They will not be placed in personal ready 
reference files, investigative notebooks, case packages, or homicide books. 

C. Release of Information:  Whenever a law enforcement agency or law 
enforcement personnel, that have not been through 28 CFR Part 23 training, 
with a ―need to know or right to know‖ make in inquiry of the APD Gang data 
base an entry will be made into Crimintel, by the IU/gang Specialist Officer, as 
a Audit/RFI (Request For Information) with the date of the request and the 
name of the person and agency into Crimintel for tracking purposes. 

  

1. Any hard copy lists generated with validated gangs and gang members 
will only be given to other law enforcement personnel with the permission 
of the Deputy Chief of Operations and a Document Sign-Out Log will be 
completed by the person taking the list out of the Intel office.  This log will 
be maintained in the secure Intel Office. 

D. Discovery Motions and court Requests for Records:  The Deputy Chief of 
Operations shall be notified of, and be responsible for, all legal requests 
pertaining to information or records from the IU. 

IX. PHOTOGRAPHING KNOWN OR SUSPECTED GANG MEMBERS 

A. Police Officers and Detectives will adhere to the guidelines below when 
photographing a suspected or known gang member/gang associate: 

1. Permission from the individual prior to taking a photograph when the 
person is NOT being arrested or otherwise legally detained; 

2. No use of physical force or any form of coercion in acquiring a 
photograph; 

3. Officers and detectives will not pose the individual with gang name or 
gang identification cards; 

4. Officers and detectives will conduct the photographing 
contemporaneously with the completion of the FI card; 

5. The photographing process may not extend the time necessary to 
complete the interview process; and, 

6. The suspect will be given a full explanation for the purpose of the 
photograph. 

B. Security of Gang Member/Gang Associate photographs.  Any gang photo 
books which are created will only be maintained in the IU section and 
department units dealing with gang investigations and will be secured at all 
times.  These books are an important tool in the investigation of gang related 
crimes.  Gang photo books differ from other photo books in that they are 
assembled by gang and not by criminal offense.  The Gang Photo Books will 
be considered part of the Department‘s hard copy gang files.  Department 
personnel will follow the same security measures in regards to protecting 
gang member and gang associate photos as they do for the Gang Intel Files. 
The IU‘s Gang Photo books will only be taken into the field for investigative 
purposes and with the approval of the Deputy Chief of Operations.  A 
Document Sign-Out Log will be completed by the person taking the book(s) 
out of the Intel office. 

X. AUDITS AND PURGING OF THE FILEMAKER PRO, ―GANG VALIDATION 
CARD‖ DATABASE AND CRIMINTEL GANG DATABASE 

A. Audits:  Audits of hard copy files will be conducted periodically, at least 
every two years by the Deputy Chief of Operations or an appointed 

  

representative.  The findings of these audits will be reported in writing to the 
Deputy Chief of Operations. 

B. Purging:  The Crimintel Gang database will be monitored continuously for 
files that have become inactive or have not been validated.  If a file has not 
had additional gang related activity added to it within 5 years, then it shall be 
purged from the gang database, on the 5th year anniversary date of entry. 
Every time gang related activity is entered in a gang database file, such file 
will automatically update the 5 year retention period, from the date of such 
validated activity was documented.  The IU will be the only ones with this 
responsibility and the only personnel authorized to do so. 

C. Incarcerated gang members/gang associates:  Incarcerated gang 
members/gang associates will remain in the Crimintel database and any soft 
copy/hard copy files for a maximum of 5 years unless their file is updated to 
extend their active status.  Upon release from incarceration, any remaining 
time shall still be in effect until the expiration date listed on the Gang 
Intelligence Card.  During incarceration any information on gang-related 
activity by the subject can be used to update information on the Gang 
Intelligence Card.  This will reset the 5 year retention period of the 
information, based on the date of new gang-related activity.

3.10.050  Hazardous Materials 

To advise all personnel of the role of the Anchorage Police Department in 
incidents which might expose the public to accidental release of hazardous 
materials. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

The Anchorage Police Department is an initial responder to scenes of possible 
release of hazardous materials, but other agencies, most notably the Anchorage 
Fire Department, have primary responsibility for scene management and control.  
As responders, however, members shall take all reasonable measures to protect 
the public and themselves from exposure to any harmful materials.  Further, 
secondary consideration shall be given to minimizing possible environmental 
impact from such accidental releases. 

DISCUSSION 

There is a remarkably large volume of hazardous material used in the Anchorage 
area.  One might expect explosives and radioactive material on the local military 
installations, but seemingly less likely places, such as hospitals and clinics, 
construction companies, and various University facilities have an abundance of 
such material as well.  Even service stations host the commonly underestimated 
hazards of various petroleum products. 

When an officer responds to an accident or fire scene, there may be no certain 
way of ensuring that unmarked hazardous materials have not been released.  
Officers, therefore, must be alert to subtle clues that identify certain events as 
possibly being ―hazmat‖ situations.  This procedure is designed to help bridge the 
gap between the initial call for service and the implementation of the existing 
Disaster Plan. 

DEFINITIONS 

  

Hazardous Material:  For purposes of this procedure, ―hazardous material‖ (often 
referred to as ―HazMat‖) is any element, compound, or combination thereof that 
is flammable, corrosive, detonable, toxic, radioactive, an oxidizer, an etiological 
agent, or highly reactive and that because of handling, storing, processing, and 
packaging, may have detrimental effects upon operating and emergency 
personnel, the public, equipment, or the environment. 

This procedure is an adjunct to the Anchorage Municipal Disaster Plan. 

REFERENCES 

PROCEDURE 

I. IDENTIFICATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS 

A. Unmarked Materials.  Federal laws govern the proper packaging, shipping, 
and marking of hazardous materials, but only apply to commercial transport 
and transport by air.  Officers can, therefore, be confronted with a private 
individual in a personal vehicle transporting hazardous material in any 
fashion.  Should that vehicle become involved, for instance, in an accident or 
vandalism, officers may unwittingly approach a scene with a breached 
container of deadly material.  The following are guidelines which, experience 
has shown, can aid officers in identifying and coping with such potential. 

1. Be alert to unusual odors or sounds.  

2. Note the structure or vehicle markings.  Military vehicles, businesses 
which might use explosives or chemicals, and the like should be suspect.  

3. Be alert to the Federal markings which might still be on the container.  
These markings are discussed later in this procedure, but the fact that the 
container is marked at all should alert officers.  

4. Do not eat, drink, or smoke at any call.  

5. Try to remain upwind and uphill from any scene suspected of having 
hazardous materials. For explosives, distance is most important. 

B. Marked Materials.  Except for the immediate task of protecting the public, 
the most important duty officers can perform is identifying any hazardous 
materials.  The Department of Transportation (DOT) has standardized labels 
and developed titles and codes to assist emergency personnel in these 
events.  If labeled, the placard will identify the container(s) of hazardous 
material, and either specify the nature of the agent (caustic, flammable, 
radioactive, etc.), and/or provide the number code of the exact contents.  This 
number code shall be provided to the Dispatch Center who can, in turn, 
research the particular details of the agent. 

II. OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES 

A. Scene Recognition.  Officers should be sensitive to the clues and 
guidelines described above to help identify those scenes which might have 
released hazardous materials. 

  

B. Scene Management. 

1. Officers should make a practice of approaching all potential "haz mat" 
scenes upwind and uphill, and never eating, smoking or drinking.  Officer 
safety cannot be overstressed. 

2. Officers primary duties of protecting the public remains.  This usually 
necessitates maintaining a wide perimeter. 

3. If hazardous material is located, look for clues as to the nature of the 
material.  This is most often done by reading the placard and forwarding 
that information to the Dispatch Center.  Officers are reminded that 
binoculars can aid in this identification. 

C. Recognition of Command Van.  Officers should recall that, for hazardous 
materials emergencies, the Command Van is identified by a green emergency 
light system. 

D. Implementation of Disaster Plan.  Supervisory personnel decide if the 
appropriate portion of the Disaster Plan is to be implemented.

accidents, injuries, and blood borne pathogen exposures. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

The policy of the Anchorage Police Department is to: 

Report and document all accidents, injuries, and exposures immediately; 

Provide assistance and follow-up for injured or exposed employees; 

Investigate and report the causes of accidents, injuries, and exposures; 

Reduce the frequency of accidents, injuries, and exposures; 

Maintain complete and accurate records of all employees‘ accidents, injuries, 
and exposures. 

DEFINITIONS 

Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) means a "retrovirus" (identified 
as Human Immunodeficiency Virus [HIV]) which invades and destroys the 
victim's immune system, rendering the victim susceptible to secondary infection.  
Symptoms include immunodeficiency and life-threatening secondary infection or 
other diseases (cancer, one type of pneumonia, possibly a form of tuberculosis, 
and nervous system disorders). 

AIDS Related Complex (ARC) means a condition caused by the AIDS virus in 
which the patient tests positive for the AIDS infection but has less severe 
symptoms than classic AIDS.  Symptoms include loss of appetite, weight loss, 
fever, night sweats, skin rashes, diarrhea, tiredness, lack of resistance to 
infection, and/or swollen lymph nodes. 

Communicable disease means any infectious disease capable of being passed 
to another by contact with an infected individual or their body fluids. 

  

Exposure incident means, as defined by OSHA, specifically direct contact with 
the eye, mouth, other mucous membrane, non-intact skin, or parenteral contact 
(puncture of the skin) with blood or other potentially infectious materials, 
including through inhalation, during the performance of an employee's duties. 

Hepatitis A, B, and C are diseases involving inflammation of the liver.   

Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1) means the virus that causes Acquired 
Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). 

Occupational hazardous materials exposure (on-the-job) means any contact via 
inhalation, ingestion, eye, skin, or other means with hazardous or toxic materials 
or chemicals (include those found at meth labs), excessive smoke, or ionizing 
radiation, which occurs during or results from an employee's performance.  

Occupational injury or illness (on-the-job) means any cut, abrasion, bruise, burn, 
physical pain, illness, impairment of the function of a bodily member, organ, or 
mental faculty; or any other harm to the body, no matter how temporary, which 
occurs during or results from the performance of an employee's duties. 

Occupational infectious disease exposure (on-the-job) means is any specific 
contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials to the eye, mouth, 
other mucous membranes, non-intact skin, or parenteral penetration of mucous 
membranes or the skin barrier through such events as needle sticks, human 
bites, cuts, and abrasions, which occurs during or results from an employee's 
performance. 

Post Exposure Panel means the laboratory tests of blood and urine specimens 
consisting of preliminary tests, with confirmation, for Hepatitis B Surface 
Antibody, Hepatitis C Surface Antibody and Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 
(HIV-1) Antibodies. 

Blood:  Human blood components and products made from human blood. 

Blood borne Pathogens:  Pathogenic microorganisms that are present in human 
blood and can cause disease in humans.  These pathogens include, but are not 
limited to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus HIV). 

Contaminated:  The presence or the reasonably anticipated presence of blood or 
other potentially infectious materials on an item or surface. 

Contaminated Laundry:  Laundry that has been soiled with blood or other 
potentially infectious materials. 

I. NOTIFICATION AND RESPONSE - General 

PROCEDURE 

A. All Employee Involved Accidents, Occupational Injuries and Blood borne 
Exposure Incidents shall be immediately reported to a supervisor.  

B. If reported via radio or phone to the dispatch center, Dispatch shall 
immediately notify the: 

  

1. Anchorage Fire Department Emergency Medical Services Health and 
Safety Officer if an employee has been exposed to a blood borne 
contaminant.  An APD supervisor will coordinate the immediate 
decontamination of the employee with the assistance of AFD. 

2. On-duty Patrol Shift Commander and Patrol Supervisor. 

3. The employee's immediate unit supervisor, or commander, when 
assigned to a division or unit other than Patrol. 

II. OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE, INJURY OR ILLNESS REPORTING 

A. Employees: 

1. Employees shall immediately make it known to their supervisor, by the 
quickest means available, that they, or a co-worker, have been in an 
accident, exposed, injured, become sick or ill, as a direct result of 
performing their assigned duties. 

2. Any employee who is injured in the course of their duties is entitled to 
receive worker‘s compensation benefits pursuant to State and Municipal 
laws, regulations and procedures. 

3. If an occupational exposure, injury or illness results in loss of work time 
the employee shall be evaluated by a physician within 24 hours or prior to 
the next scheduled shift start time, and provide a Return to Work Notice 
prior to resuming assigned duties.  

4. All employees are responsible to properly report to their supervisor any 
contamination of facilities, vehicles, or equipment and to take all 
reasonable steps necessary to minimize the hazard to themselves and 
others. 

B. Supervisors: 

1. An on-duty Patrol Supervisor shall respond immediately to a report of 
an employee involved Accident, Occupational Injury or Exposure Incident 
and:  

a). Interview the employee to determine how the exposure / injury 
occurred. 

b). Determine the nature (bloodborne, airborne, communicable, 
hazardous material, etc.). 

c). Initiate and submit all required documentation and forms defined in 
this policy.  

d). Ensure the employee receives appropriate medical treatment 
and/or counseling by medical personnel if exposed to blood borne 
pathogen within four (4) hours of exposure. 

2. The responding supervisor/commander shall be responsible for 
completion of the required employer documentation (see below section 
―III‖ for appropriate forms), except that a supervisor from another Division 

  

or Unit may conduct a non-traffic related investigation when involving an 
assigned subordinate employee. 

III. DOCUMENTS AND FORMS 

A. Accident and Occupational Injury or Exposure:  The following 
documentation shall be completed for all accident and occupational injury and 
exposure related incidents before the end of the shift: 

1. Municipality of Anchorage - Supervisor‘s Report of Accident  

2. Municipality of Anchorage - Automobile / Equipment Accident Report  

3. Workers Compensation - Report of Occupational Injury or Illness 

4. Anchorage Police Department - Exposure Incident Report 

B. The supervisor will be responsible for forwarding the original reports to the 
Division Commander immediately upon completion.  After reviewing the 
incident, the division commander or their designee will forward the reports 
and documentation of any accident, occupational injury and blood borne 
exposure to the Department Personnel Section and to the Municipal Risk 
Manager.  Injury and exposure reports shall be forwarded within 24 hours of 
the incident. 

IV. POST EXPOSURE PROCEDURE 

A. Whenever it can be determined that a police employee was exposed, or 
potentially exposed, to a chemical, hazardous material, airborne agent or 
toxin, percutaneous (needlestick), bloodborne pathogen, a potential 
communicable disease carrier, or other agent, the following shall apply: 

1. The employee shall immediately: 

a). Notify their supervisor; 

b). Seek or be provided immediate medical attention; 

c). Arrange collection of a base line biological specimen of their blood; 

d). Obtain counseling regarding risk factors and treatment options from 
a physician within 4 hours of exposure to blood borne pathogen.  

There is a 4 hour window of opportunity from time of exposure for 
prophylactic treatment on HIV so it‘s imperative the officer receive counseling 
and treatment as soon as possible.  

2. The supervisor shall immediately: 

a). review the circumstances of the exposure incident to determine: 

i. If the exposure was through percutaneous (needle stick), mucous 
membrane, airborne, inhalation, non intact skin or other. 

ii. If the employee was assaulted, does probable cause exist to 
apply for a search warrant to seize the medical records, biological 
specimens of blood and urine. 

  

iii. If the employee was not assaulted, seek consensual collection of 
medical records and biological specimens of blood and urine. 

iv. If no consent is given, the supervisor should coordinate with 
medics and hospital personnel to obtain information under the Ryan 
White Act. 

v. Notify Risk Management about the incident within 24 hours either 
by email or phone call.  

vi. Advise employee to submit receipts for any damaged personal 
items to supervisor who will forward them to Risk Management for 
restitution purposes. 

V. POST EXPOSURE SEARCH WARRANTS FOR CRIMINAL ACTS 

A. Application for a search warrant for biological specimens from a potential 
disease carrier can be difficult to obtain due to the federal right to privacy act 
which provides protection of a person‘s medical history and records.  
However, the Ryan White Act does allow some access to such records 
without patient permission for pre-hospital personnel. 

B. Alaska Statute requires that Courts only issue Search Warrants to obtain 
evidence of a crime; therefore Search Warrants can not be obtained for the 
medical records of a suspect who has exposed an employee through an act 
which does not constitute a crime.  Crimes like Assault, Reckless 
Endangerment, Disorderly Conduct, and Resisting should be considered 
when seeking a search warrant for biological specimens in an exposure 
incident.  Risk factors of the suspect‘s life style, as well as statements made 
by the suspect typically provide the link between the exposure incident and 
the crime which will show that the biological specimens and test results will be 
evidence of a crime. 

C. Application for a search warrant should contain, at a minimum, the 
following requested information: 

1. Provide the probable cause for obtaining biological samples of blood 
and urine from a known, or suspected, communicable disease carrier. 

2. Request for two (2) 10 ml biological specimens of blood, consisting of: 

a). One (1) control vial (available later for defendant or validation of 
tests) to be placed in Property and Evidence as evidence; and  

b). One (1) test vial. Officers should check with the lab conducting the 
tests at the time of the draw to determine what type of blood draw is 
necessary. 

3. Request one (1) 100 ml biological specimen of urine. 

4. Request laboratory testing of standard post panel medical tests  

5. Request a copy of all laboratory test results and interpretations. 

6. Request suspect‘s medical records. 

  

VI. EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT CRIMINAL ACTS: 

A. Officers may find themselves potentially exposed to a communicable 
disease where it was not caused by a criminal act.  These include 
percutaneous (needle stick), airborne exposure (responding to a call for 
service and learn after that occupant(s) had TB, Meningitis, etc.) and 
incidental 1st responder exposure (blood splatter at a vehicle crash).  These 
types or exposures must be handled without a search warrant since the 
results of any medical tests would not constitute evidence of a crime.   

1. Percutaneous (needle stick):  A needle stick occurring during a pat 
down search may actually be a criminal act, specifically if the officer asked 
the person if they had any thing dangerous, anything sharp or anything 
that may cut them.  It is good officer safety to ask specifically about 
needles as well.  If this occurred and the suspect denied any such items 
and as a result a percutaneous (needle stick) exposure occurs criminal 
charges should be filed and a search warrant should be obtained.  Other 
percutaneous (needle stick) exposures would require a consent for 
Biological Specimens from the source if known but may result in only the 
exposed employee receiving medical treatment based on the exposure 
and risk factors. 

2. Airborne exposures to disease are typically reported to the responders 
by the source or by medical personnel treating the source.  In these cases 
Officers should be evaluated for the level of exposure and treatment.  On 
unknown HAZMAT type exposures, AFD should be consulted to 
determine the source and identity of the exposure. 
3. Incidental 1st responder exposure is addressed by the Ryan White Act 
which allows Doctors to share medical information to treat exposed 1st 
responders.  For example, if a 1st responder is exposed while rendering 
aid at an 11-24, his care provider should be in contact with the injured 
subject‘s doctor to determine the risks and provide for the appropriate 
treatment. 

4. For exposure to blood borne pathogens and potential communicable 
diseases where the suspect is willing to provide consent, request that the 
hospital draw and test the blood and urine for all possible communicable 
diseases.  

5. In all cases of suspected exposure, regardless if the suspect is charged 
(and a warrant is pursued) or whether or not the suspect is willing to 
provide consent, the employee should be provided the opportunity to 
respond to the hospital to complete the following: 

a). Treat the injury; 

b). Request a blood draw for baseline purposes and for all appropriate 
tests for communicable diseases; 

c). Request a copy of all laboratory test results (including the 
suspect‘s, if available) be provided to the employee directly for 

  

evaluation and treatment as necessary.  Some diseases require 
immediate treatment. 

VII. RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACCIDENTS, INJURIES, EXPOSURES 

A. Accidents, injuries or exposures resulting from insubordination, blatant or 
willful disregard of safe work prevention measures, all Municipal rules, 
regulations or department policy, procedures and instructions are culpable 
and subject to progressive discipline relative to the circumstances and 
severity of the incident, as may be determination by the Chief of Police. 

B. Supervisors are responsible for ensuring their subordinates are 
knowledgeable of and compliant with all Municipal and Department rules, 
regulations and procedures, and impress upon them that accidents resulting 
from negligence are unacceptable. 

VIII. CONTAMINATION OF VEHICLES 

A. If a vehicle is slightly contaminated (small amounts of infectious materials 
present), it shall be the employee‘s responsibility to clean and decontaminate 
the vehicle using decontamination supplies available through the APD supply 
section.  Employees shall wear the appropriate protective clothing (gloves, 
mask, eye protection) when cleaning the contaminated vehicle.   

B. If the vehicle is significantly contaminated the employee shall:  

1. Take the vehicle out-of-service; 

2. Lock all doors; 

3. Place a bio-hazard warning label on the vehicle so it is clearly visible 
from the outside to others; 

4. Notify a supervisor to have the vehicle detailed by Service Master. 

IX. CONTAMINATION OF EQUIPMENT 

A. Equipment that is slightly contaminated (small amounts of infectious 
materials present) shall be cleaned and decontaminated by the employee 
using decontamination supplies available from the APD Supply section.  
Employees will wear the appropriate protective clothing (gloves, mask, eye 
protection) when cleaning the contaminated equipment.   

B. Equipment shall be cleaned as soon as practical after the contamination is 
discovered.  If a piece of equipment is too contaminated or unable to be 
cleaned by the employee, a supervisor shall be notified and the equipment 
removed from service. 

X. CONTAMINATION OF POLICE K9s 

A. In the event of a police K9 bite, the handler will immediately clean the 
dog‘s muzzle of any blood or body fluid so as to preclude the possibility of 
accidental transmission via dog bite. 

B. As soon as practical, the handler will clean any other blood or body fluid 
from the dog‘s body as per unit procedures. 

  

XI. CONTAMINATION OF UNIFORM / CLOTHING 

A. Employees shall remove contaminated uniforms and clothing as soon as 
practical. 

B. Any skin that contacted the contaminated clothing shall be cleaned and 
decontaminated as well using commercial decontaminants. 

C. Contaminated clothing shall be placed in a bag/box and clearly marked 
with an orange bio-hazard sticker (found at the property table) and disposed 
of in an approved bio-hazard waste receptacle located in the evidence 
packaging area. 

D. Employees needing to have uniforms replaced due to contamination shall 
submit a request through the APD Supply section.   

E. Employees who replace contaminated personal equipment should submit 
the receipts to their supervisor for forwarding to Risk Management for 
restitution purposes. 

XII. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) 

A. PPE is issued as needed by supply. 

B. Employees shall use PPE anytime there is a potential for exposure to 
blood.  The exception shall be when, under rare and extraordinary 
circumstances, the employee determines that in the specific instance its use 
would have prevented the delivery of health care or public safety services or 
would have posed an increased hazard to the safety of the worker or co-
worker.   

XIII. HEPATITIS ―B‖ VACCINATION 

A. The hepatitis ―B‖ vaccination will be provided to employees working in the 
following areas of the Anchorage Police Department: 

1. All sworn 

2. Non-sworn personnel working in the property and records sections 

B. The hepatitis ―B‖ vaccine will be administered to each employee by the 
MOA‘s Department of Health and Human Services General Clinic. 

C. The vaccination is not mandatory, but encouraged unless: 

1. Documentation exists that the employee has previously received the 
series from another employee.   

2. Medical evaluation shows the vaccination is contraindicated. 

D. If an employee chooses to decline vaccination, the employee must sign a 
declination statement indicating they do not wish the vaccine.  Employees 
who decline may request and obtain the vaccination at a later date at no cost.

3.10.060  Language Translation 

To advise all personnel of the options and facilities available when dealing with 
subjects who do not speak the English language. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

That persons who do not speak the English language, not have that feature 
impede satisfactory communications with members of the Anchorage Police 
Department. 

I. RESOURCES FOR TRANSLATING 

PROCEDURES 

A. Contact Dispatch Center:  The Dispatch Center shall be contacted to 
determine if any on-duty personnel are fluent in the language in question. 

1. In cases where the Dispatch Center receives emergency telephone 
calls requiring interpreting, the call-taker may use the most immediate and 
expedient method available for translation, including the use of ―CALL, 
Inc.,‖ described in ―B.‖ below.  If used, the Dispatch Center may dial direct 
instead of processing through the Records Section as instructed later in 
this procedure. 

B. Research Other Local Service Agencies:  If no on-duty personnel are able 
to translate, then the Dispatch Center should be instructed to research other 
local service agencies from their call-out list, such as the court system or 
volunteer resources.  If none are available,  

C. Use the Services of ―Communication and Language Line, Inc‖ (CALL).  
This facility and how to use it is discussed in detail next. 

II. ―CALL‖ TRANSLATION SERVICES 

A. Description of Service.  ―CALL‖ is a telephone subscription service that 
operates 24 hours a day, and translates over 100 languages.  This translation 

  

service is provided by way of a conference call, and the Department is billed 
for the actual use-time of the interpreter. 

B. Procedure for Use of CALL Services.  Officers may use the CALL services 
if no other interpretive services are available.  When used, the following 
applies: 

1. The need for interpreter services and identification of the subject 
language can be established by showing the language identification card 
to the victim/suspect/witness.  

2. Officers should organize the questions prior to CALL being requested.  

3. Telephone 786-8940 to notify the Records Section to initiate a three-
way conversation between the interpreter, Records Section personnel, 
and the victim/suspect/witness.  This allows:  

a). Electronic recording through the 911 facility.  

b). Records Section to log the call for later retrieval.  

4. When the CALL representative is reached, furnish that person with:  

a). The language requested,  

b). APD‘s identification number of 151010, and  

c). Officers name and DSN.  

5. That representative will put the appropriate interpreter on line.  That 
interpreter will furnish his/her identification number for the record. 

6. Officers will furnish the interpreter with the exact information needed.  

7. At this point, officers will:  

a). Give the telephone to the subject, unless 

b). A conference telephone, speaker telephone, or two-telephone-on-
one-line is available, allowing officers to monitor the entire 
conversation.  

8. When done, the interpreter will apprise officers of the information 
gleaned. 

9. The interpreter will await any further instructions/ questions to be asked.  

10. When the interviewing has concluded, officers will terminate the call by 
saying ―END OF CALL‖.  

11. If appropriate, investigating officers can locate and retrieve the 911 
tape using existing evidence procedures found in the "Property and 
Evidence" procedure.

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.10.065  Mobile Data Computers 

To advise all personnel of the proper use and security of the Mobile Data 
Computer (MDC). 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

It shall be the policy of the Anchorage Police Department that employees uphold 
the highest standard of professionalism while utilizing the Mobile Data Computer 
as well as to provide officers and dispatchers a more efficient option to a 
standard voiced dispatch system. 

I. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE 

PROCEDURES 

A. Use of the MDC must comply with FCC rules and regulations as well as 
federal and state laws governing discrimination and sexual harassment. 
Employees using the MDC system shall be personally responsible for the 
proper use of this equipment and appropriate messaging content.  All 
broadcasts shall be limited to duty related business.  Under no circumstances 
shall an employee using the MDC system broadcast anything that is in 
violation of policies of the Anchorage Police Department (e.g. Language and 
Prejudice 1.02.015C and Harassment 1.02.015O).  This includes, but is not 
limited to, comments relating to sex, race, religion or any language that 
creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.  Employees 
should be reminded that the guidelines prescribed in the Radio 
Communications portion of the PI, specifically section 03.08.010, are still in 
effect and pertain to MDC usage.  Employees are advised that electronic 
messages should be considered public domain.  Electronic messages are 
stored, periodically reviewed by authorized Commanders, and subject to use 
in both criminal and civil matters. 

B. The goal of this policy is to reduce non-priority voice traffic on the main 
APD radio frequencies.  As a general rule, all voice traffic will receive a voice 

  

reply and all data traffic via the laptop will receive a data reply.  Officers and 
dispatchers alike have the discretion to voice any transmission at any time.  
During times of system slow down or malfunction, operations will revert to all 
voice.  Notification of such will be made over the main radio channel. 

C. Employees are discouraged from being logged into CAD just for 
observation and monitoring purposes.  If an employee logs onto the MDC with 
no intention of being available for dispatches, they should enter ―OFF‖ in the 
unit ID field of the log in screen.  The exception to this will be for those who 
are actively utilizing the MDC for research, system training, and/or testing.  
This section shall be adhered to in an attempt to have only those employees 
available for dispatches to be seen on the dispatch screen.   

II. OPERATIONAL PROCEDURE 

A. A voiced response from the officer requires no laptop input on his/her part 
except when logging on-duty at beginning of shift. The dispatcher will type all 
other voiced CAD transactions 

B. The following radio traffic will be voiced by Dispatch: 

1. All Code 3 or Code 4 calls. 

2. All in-progress calls. 

3. Updates to a call previously dispatched when a unit is not on scene (10-
7).  If pertinent comments are added to a call, especially officer safety 
information or information that would change the priority of a call, Dispatch 
will verbally confirm the officer has received the updated information. 

4. All locates that are of an urgent nature or that compromise officer 
safety.  For all other locates, a CAD message will be sent to mobile units 
with a brief content description in the following format: MSG MDC, 
broadcast (the information from the locate). 

5. All two unit calls unless there is significant information to lead the 
Dispatcher or Officer to believe the suspect has a radio scanner.   

6. All calls of an urgent nature being held. 

7. All cancellations on a call that has been dispatched. 

8. All information that needs to be passed to an officer who is away from 
their laptop. 

9. Dispatch has the discretion to voice any transmission at any time it is 
thought to be pertinent. 

10. All clear channel (10-44) advisements.  In addition to this, Dispatchers 
will provide a CAD message to all MDCs every 3-5 minutes advising of the 
clear channel (10-44).  When the clear channel (10-44) has been 
removed, the dispatcher will send out that message as well.   

C. The dispatcher will also advise by radio that a call is being sent on the 
MDC by use of the code ―10-25‖ (old APD code meaning ―respond to the 

  

area‖).  Example:  ―22B1, 10-25…‖  The officer will acknowledge this voiced 
transmission.   

D. The following radio traffic will be voiced by officers: 

1. All traffic stops (10-70‘s). 

2. All field interviews (10-76‘s). 

3. All cover officer (10-34) requests. 

4. All available for calls advisements (10-8‘s). 

5. All traffic related to clear channels (10-44‘s).  

6. Officers logging out on a unit they were not previously in route to. 

7. All medic/fire requests. 

8. Community Service Patrol, Impound, sand or roadway hazard requests 
will be verbalized on Channel 2 (this prevents multiple messages being 
sent by different officers for the same item). 

9. An officer coming on duty. 

10. Officers acknowledging they are in route as a cover officer (10-34). 

11. Officers in route to or at lunch (10-80). 

12. Whenever there is a ―hit alert‖ on warrants from the laptop, the officer 
will voice to the dispatcher when a cover officer (10-34) is not needed.  
The exception to this will be when the officer has already advised dispatch 
of person being in custody (10-17) prior to running the ―hit‖ on the laptop. 

13. Officers have the discretion to voice any transmission at any time it is 
thought to be pertinent. 

14. Officers also have the discretion to not voice a transmission if needed 
to maintain operational security. 

III. EQUIPMENT SECURITY 

Safeguarding of the MDC is the user‘s responsibility.  Due the expense of the 
equipment and the sensitive nature of the information available through the MDC, 
the following procedures will be followed. 

A. All unattended vehicles with an MDC shall be: 

1. Locked, 

2. with the MDC locked in the docking station, 

3. And the key removed from the docking station itself. 

B. In accordance with the manufacture‘s operating instruction, MDC users 
shall not subject their MDC units to temperatures below 32˚ or above 113˚F. 

C. Any lost or damaged MDC equipment shall immediately be reported to a 
supervisor. 

  

IV. ELECTRONIC CITATION PROCEDURES 

Officer issuing electronic citations via the MDC under the authority of the 
Anchorage Police Department shall adhere to the following practices: 

A.  Officers shall use their Municipality of Anchorage-issued Department 

Serial Number (DSN) as their Unique Person Identifier. 

B.  Once authorized to issue electronic citations, officers must sign the 

Officer‘s Acknowledgement and Certification Form prior to issuing their 
initial electronic citation. 

C.  When issuing citations, officers must first log in using their own user name 
and password issued by the MOA. Upon completing and validating all 
information on the citation, the Officer’s Signature line will display their 
printed name and DSN as an electronic signature. Note: An officer‘s 
electronic signature is the legally-binding equivalent of signing a citation 
by hand. Officers cannot deny responsibility for an electronically-issued 
citation bearing their printed name and DSN. 

D.  Officers shall at no time use a password or user name of another officer or 

allow another officer to use theirs to sign in to the system. 

E.  Should the need arise for officers to share a computer in order to issue a 
citation, each officer must sign in individually using their own unique user 
name and password. 

F.  Once a citation has been issued to a violator, officers shall not modify an 
electronic citation for any reason, except for the ―Officer‘s Notes‖ field. 

G.  If a citation is issued in error or if a discrepancy is noted on the citation, 
the Records Section shall be responsible for voiding the citation and 
notifying the court if necessary. 

H.  Should an officer request the Records Section to void a citation, the 

reason for such action shall be documented in the ―Remarks‖ field of the 
citation screen.

3.10.070  Safe Haven for Infants 

The purpose of this policy is to instruct all members of the Anchorage Police 
Department on the procedures regarding a parent that surrenders a newborn 
infant into the custody of emergency or medical personnel. 

The purpose of this policy is to instruct all members of the Anchorage Police 
Department on the procedures regarding the procedures for the investigation of 
infants under the age of 21 days old who have been surrendered by a parent or 
guardian. 

PURPOSE 

POLICY 

DISCUSSION 

Effective May, 11, 2008 Alaska State Law allows a parent to surrender an infant 
who is less than 21 days old to a ―peace officer, physician or hospital employee, 
or a volunteer or employee of a fire station or emergency medical service‖ 
without criminal repercussions, as long as the infant has not been physically 
harmed.  Leaving the infant with the proper authorities will allow the parent to 
extinguish his or her legal duty to support the infant.  In addition, as long as there 
is no evidence that the infant has been physically injured, the parent will not face 
prosecution.  The Act is intended to enable the parent(s) of a newborn to 
relinquish the infant to a safe environment, to remain anonymous and to avoid 
civil or criminal liability for relinquishing the infant. 

Parent:  The legal guardian of an infant  

Infant:  A child who is less than 21 days old.  

DEFINITIONS

This policy is the internal use only and does not enlarge an employee‘s civil 
liability in any way.  The policy should not be construed as creating a higher duty 
of care, in an evidentiary sense, with respect to third party civil claims against 
employees.  A violation of this policy, if proven, can only form the basis of a 
complaint by this department for non-judicial administrative action in accordance 
with the laws governing employee discipline. 

3.10.075  School Protocol 

To advise all personnel of those additional procedures required when responding 
to calls on school property, or involving people at events under school control. 

That members of the Department adhere to established protocol when 
intervening in events otherwise under the authority of school officials. 

If an officer were to, say, enter a business establishment in an official capacity, 
courtesy would dictate that certain traditions be recognized.  The receptionist 
would be notified of the person(s) sought, those people would be given a 
reasonable time to respond and, if an employee were required to leave, that 
person‘s supervisor would be notified of the impending change in office staff.  
When officers enter a school, or intervenes in a school function, this ―protocol‖ 
becomes more structured and important, as the school officials have a legal duty 
to act as ―local parents‖--they are the immediate guardians of minors attending 
their school.  This procedure identifies methods of simultaneously satisfying this 
obligation, while effectively performing police duties. 

When dealing with school officials, officers would be well advised to remain alert 
to the concept of ―agent of the police‖.  School officials, having an eye towards 
protecting their charge, will often volunteer to conduct searches and interview 
suspects as ―parents‖, having pre-decided to report their findings in full to 
officers.  Legally, this is easily argued as being tantamount to ―deputizing‖ a 
citizen for purposes of that one case. 

DEFINITIONS 

School System:  For purposes of this procedure, any institution established, 
maintained, or certified by the State as an educational facility wherein minors 
might attend. 

  

Loco Parentis:  In law, and for purposes of this procedure, the concept of ―local 
parents‖.  School officials assume various responsibilities to, and authority over, 
minors entrusted to their (temporary) care and supervision similar to that of a 
parent‘s.  Due to this relationship, any contact with a minor under the purview of 
a school requires coordination equivalent to that a parent would be entitled to 
under similar circumstances.  Note that this principle applies when the school 
assumes responsibility for the child.  Should a child, for instance, be taken into 
custody for trespassing on school grounds after hours, no coordination would be 
required with school officials.  Conversely, a minor taken into custody for an 
alcohol violation while participating in a school activity, even though off school 
grounds and after hours would require full coordination. 

Agent of the Police:  In law, and for purposes of this procedure, the concept of a 
citizen acting on behalf of the police.  With such direct interplay, that an unsworn 
person loses his/her status as private citizen, and constructively becomes a 
―police officer,‖ and must abide by all Constitutional, statutory, and case law 
provisions required of ―police.‖ 

I. NON-EMERGENCY EVENTS 

PROCEDURE 

A. On Call for Service.  If any non-emergency call requires officers to contact 
a minor while under school control and supervision, the following applies: 

1. Contact the Principal or his/her designee first. 

2. Anticipate a school representative attending the interview, as specified 
in the Anchorage School District‘s Administrative Manual. 

B. Arrests.  Arrest/custody of a minor may be taken on school grounds.  
However, officers should be aware of the Anchorage School District‘s 
Administrative Manual‘s provision that instructs school officials to maximize 
safety and minimize disruption to the school and embarrassment to the 
student. 

1. Although the responsibility to notify the parents of a juvenile‘s arrest is 
shared with the Principal, officers shall confirm that notification by either 
making the contact themselves, or documenting the statement by the 
Principal or his/her designee that such notification was made. 

C. Non-arrest Removals from School Authority.  In non-emergency situations 
where officers desire to interview or remove the minor from school purview, 
permission has to be received from the Principal or his/her designee. 

D. Evidence.  Officers are reminded that, in the investigation of a crime, 
evidence is seized, submitted to the Property and Evidence Section and, if 
appropriate, lab-tested exactly as any other investigation would be conducted.  
The school does not retain or control any property identified as evidence.  
Note:  Upon confiscation of items described as "firearms", see 3.04.015. 

II. EMERGENCY EVENTS 

  

A. General.  In general, no distinction is made between an emergency 
occurring on school grounds or during a school event and one occurring 
under other circumstances.  Once the emergency has concluded, however, 
coordination with school officials is appropriate. 

B. Lock Downs.  The term ―lockdown‖ has a very specific and serious 
meaning in the Anchorage School District.  In fact, their protocol identifies four 
variant levels of security for emergent situations some lesser in the amount of 
disruption to the school setting, used prior to arriving at the decision of a 
complete and total ―lock down‖.  They are duck-cover-hold, stay-put, shelter-
in-place and evacuate.  Stay-put and Lockdown are defined below: 

C. Stay-Put 

D. Lockdown 

1. Everyone outside is ushered into the building.  Exterior doors and windows 
are locked.  Classes and other activities are conducted as normally as 
possible.  This is for moose or bear in the area or if APD is looking for a 
criminal in the neighborhood.  The action is taken to prevent outside problems 
from becoming the schools. 

1. Everyone outside runs into the building or to a predetermined safe 
haven nearby.  Exterior doors and windows are locked.  Classroom doors 
are locked, lights may be turned off, and shades may be drawn.  Students 
get down on the floor behind available cover.  Colored cards go up in 
windows so APD snipers are aware of what is in each classroom.  This is 
primarily used for an active shooter on campus or inside the school. 

2. The term ―lock down‖ triggers a wide and immediate chain of events, 
the results of which are long lasting and cause major disruption to the 
normal flow of business in the schools in addition to causing unnecessary 
panic and fear in the staff, students and parents who almost always hear 
about it.  As a result the APD should refrain from using this term until and 
unless it has been determined that this extreme measure is warranted or if 
an officer who is present at the scene has taken command of the scene 
and determined that this safety measure is in the best interest of all 
parties. 

3. Although helpful to the Anchorage School district, it in not required or 
expected that APD personnel commit their terms to memory, rather they 
are provided for your information only.  It is however required that at the 
onset of an emergent event involving the school system that the APD 
scene supervisor or dispatcher provide ASD with as much pertinent 
information as possible so that they(ASD) can determine which level of 
security is appropriate.  Periodic updates should be provided as time 
permits.  The school however, must make the final decision. 

4. Bomb Threats.  Note that school policy is to solicit the advice of the 
police department in determining if evacuation is appropriate.  The school, 
however, must make the final decision to evacuate or not.  All other 

  

aspects of the bomb threat call would be conventional, including 
notification of EOD and a Command Officer or Supervisor.

3.10.080  Tire Deflation Devices 

To advise all personnel of the policy and procedures governing the use of tire 
deflation devices. 

PURPOSE 

PROCEDURE 

I. FUNCTION AND TRAINING 

A. The tire deflation device is an effective tool designed to stop or reduce the 
speed of a vehicle by deflating pneumatic tires (tubes or tubeless type).  The 
unit is designed to be laid across the roadway (or other path of the fleeing 
vehicle) so that when a vehicle passes over them the hollow spikes penetrate 
the tire(s) and pull free from the bar.  The tires are then deflated at a 
controlled rate, resulting in the partial immobilization of the vehicle. 

B. The Chief of Police shall approve tire deflation devices for use by members 
of the Anchorage Police Department. 

C. Officers using tire deflation devices will deploy tire deflation devices in the 
configuration and manner prescribed by the manufacturer. 

D. All users of the tire deflation device must receive Department-approved 
training in the use of the device.  This does not preclude other law 
enforcement agencies from assisting in the control of the incident. 

II. AUTHORIZTION AND USE OF TIRE DEFLATION DEVICES 

A. Tire deflation devices will not be used to stop fleeing motorcycles or other 
two-wheeled vehicles unless the use of deadly force is authorized or 
applicable pursuant to Alaska State law.  

B. Tire deflation devices will be deployed only with the approval of a Sergeant 
or higher-ranking officer except when the circumstances surrounding the 
incident demand immediate action to resolve a dangerous situation, and a 
Sergeant/Commander cannot be reached in a timely manner. 

  

C. Tire deflation devices will not be deployed in an attempt to stop a vehicle, if 
the pursuit of that vehicle has been discontinued. 

D. With supervisor authorization, tire deflation devices may be deployed in a 
stationary vehicle situation for the following purposes: 

1. To prevent a vehicle or vehicles from being moved by a suspect 
attempting to flee a scene; or  

2. To prevent movement of a vehicle which is, or possibly will be, 
evidence.   

III. DEPLOYMENT-FLEEING VEHICLE 

A. Tire deflation devices will only be deployed after an officer verbally, with 
hand signals, or with lights and siren, warns a suspect driver to stop and the 
driver does not comply.  Exceptions to the notification rule are justified when 
in the totality of the situation or the circumstances surrounding warning the 
driver presents additional risks that clearly outweigh the justification for the 
warning. 

B. Officers shall consider vehicle and pedestrian traffic before deploying a tire 
deflation device.  If another vehicle other than a fleeing vehicle is so close 
that it could possibly run over the tire deflation device the officer should: 

1. Make reasonable effort(s) to avoid this situation.  However, even if the 
officer cannot avoid the situation, the officer is still authorized to 
reasonably position the device(s). 

2. Should a citizen ‗s vehicle be damaged, contact the motorists as  soon 
as possible, explain the situation, assist them in obtaining  assistance, and 
direct them to the Municipal Risk Management Department to file a 
compensation claim if they so desire.  Notify a supervisor of the damage. 

C. The operator deploying the tire deflation device should do so from a 
position of relative safety.  The use of barriers may conceal the operator from 
the violator‘s view and allow deployment of the device from a relatively safe 
position.  Remember, officer safety is a priority! 

IV. POST-DEPLOYMENT 

Once the suspect‘s vehicle has been ―spiked‖ and it is clear the operator is still 
trying to elude the police, officers shall adhere to the Anchorage Police 
Department‘s pursuit policy (3.06.015) in determining whether or not to pursue 
the vehicle. 

The officer deploying the tire deflation device shall: 

A. Remain near the device as long as it is deployed; 

B. As soon as practical remove remaining devices from the roadway; 

C. Wait for the pursuing law enforcement vehicles to pass the deployment 
location; 

D. Place the devices into the law enforcement vehicle; 

  

E. Notify a supervisor or commander of the deployment; 

F. Provide reasonable and necessary assistance to effect the arrest. 

V. COMMUNICATIONS 

A. The operator of the tire deflation device should have a functional portable 
radio. 

B. The pursuing officer(s) and communications personnel should attempt to 
keep all directly involved personnel informed of the following conditions: 

1. Description of the pursued vehicle 

2. Description of the pursued driver 

3. Pursuit Location 

4. Direction of travel 

5. Speed and erratic driving behavior(s) 

6. Possible weapons involved 

7. Number of people involved 

8. Other pertinent pursuit data 

C. When nearing the tire deflation device deployment location, the pursuing 
officer(s) and the tire deflation officer must maintain communication.  The 
pursuing officer(s) must back off sufficiently to allow the device to be cleared 
from the roadway. 

VI. SUPERVISORY AND COMMAND RESPONSIBILITY 

A. Upon notification that a situation exists which may require the use of a tire 
deflation device or that a tire deflation has been deployed, a commander or 
supervisor will respond to and take responsibility for the scene.  

B. The supervisor or commander responsible for the scene when a tire 
deflation device has been deployed and a suspect or civilian vehicle(s) have 
been ―spiked‖ shall forward a report detailing the circumstances of the 
deployment to the Captain of Patrol.   

VII. REPLACEMENT 

All damaged tire deflation devices shall be turned in to the Supply section for 
repair or replacement.  A copy of the police report concerning the use of the tire 
deflation device must be forwarded to the Captain of Patrol.
