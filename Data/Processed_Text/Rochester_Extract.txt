POLICY 

A.  Members  of  the  Rochester  Police  Department  (RPD)  may  use  deadly 
physical  force,  as  defined  by  Article  10  of  the  New  York  State  Penal 
Law,  only  when  the  use  of  deadly  physical  force  is  necessary  to 
defend  the  member  or  another  person  from  what  the  member 
reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical 
force. 

Reasonable  belief  exists  when  both  of  the  following  subjective  and 
objective conditions are met: 

1. 

2. 

The  member  reasonably  believes  another  person  is  using  or  is 
about to use deadly physical force, and that it is necessary for 
the  member  to  use  deadly  physical  force  to  defend  himself  or 
another person, and  

Evidence  or information which  appears reliable discloses facts 
circumstance  which  are  collectively  of  such  weight  and 
persuasiveness  as 
to  convince  a  member  of  ordinary 
intelligence,  training,  judgment,  and  experience  that  another 
person  is  using  or  is  about  to  use  deadly  physical  force,  and 
that it is necessary for the member to use deadly physical force 
to defend himself or another person. 

B.  Members  of  the  RPD  may  use  Kinetic  Energy  Impact  Projectiles 
(KEIP),  commonly  known  as  “Bean  Bag  Rounds”,  as  a  means  of  less 
lethal force in non-deadly use of force situations. KEIP are intended to

provide  a  member  with  a  less  lethal  alternative  to  safely  take  into 
custody violent or dangerous persons by allowing members to deliver 
impact projectiles from an extended range.  Only those members that 
have  successfully  completed  an  annual  training  course  and  have 
demonstrated  proficiency  in  the  use  of  KEIP  will  be  authorized  to 
deploy  same.  The  impact  projectiles  are  designed  to  incapacitate  a 
subject with a minimal potential for causing death or serious physical 
injury  compared  to  standard  projectiles  when  used  consistent  with 
training.    However,  members  must  recognize  that  a  potential  for 
death  or  serious  physical  injury  from  these  impact  projectiles  does 
exist, and that care must be exercised in their use. 

The  Pepperball  Launching  System  (PLS)  may  be  used  as  a  means  of 
less lethal force.  The PLS delivers an irritant, Capsaicin II, by means 
of  a  compressed  gas  propellant.  Only  those  members  that  have 
successfully  completed  an  annual  PLS  training  course  and  have 
demonstrated  proficiency  in  the  use  of  PLS  will  be  authorized  to 
deploy  same.    Its  primary  use  is  to  disperse  groups  engaged  in  civil 
disorder from a safe distance, but also allows members to take violent 
or dangerous individuals into custody.  Nothing shall preclude it from 
being  used  in  other  situations  in  accordance  with  current  directives 
and training. 

Conducted Electrical Weapons (CEW) may be used as a means of less 
lethal  force  in  accordance  with  current  directives  and  training.  Only 
those  members  that  have  successfully  completed  the  specific 
Department approved training and have demonstrated proficiency in 
the  use  of  CEW’s  will  be  authorized  to  deploy  same.      See  Taser 
Conducted Electrical Weapon Standard Operating Procedure. 

Less lethal force will be consistent with Departmental training and use 
of force continuum. 

The  fact  that  a  member  is  justified  in  using  deadly  physical  force  or 
less lethal force does not relieve the member from the duty to act with 
due  regard  for  the  safety  of  all  persons,  nor  will  such  provisions 
protect members from the consequences of their reckless disregard for 
the safety of other.

FIREARM GUIDELINES 

A.  Members are justified in removing firearms from holsters and/or gun 

mounts and pointing the firearm if the member reasonably believes:

2. 

That  a  person  or  a  situation  poses  or  may  pose  an  immediate 
threat  of  death  or  serious  physical  injury  either  to  themselves 
or another person. 

There  is  justification  to  use  a  firearm  against  an  animal 
pursuant to Section III.B below. 

B.  Members may use firearms against animals when they are: 

Attacking or presenting an imminent danger to any person. 

Destructive, injured, or threatening, with supervisory approval 
when there is time to obtain it.   

C.  Warning shots are prohibited. 

Discharge  of  a  firearm  from  or  at  a  moving  vehicle  is  prohibited 
unless  the  member  reasonably  believes  that  the  occupant(s)  of  the 
vehicle are using or are about to use deadly physical force against the 
member  or  another  person.    Therefore,  shooting  at  a  fleeing  vehicle 
that  is  traveling  away  from  the  member  and  is  no  longer  a  threat  to 
the member or a third person is prohibited. 

IV.  GUIDELINES – PATROL RIFLE 

Only  those  members  who  have  successfully  completed  the  specific 
training  and  have 
Department-approved  Designated  Rifleman 
demonstrated weapon proficiency will be authorized to carry a patrol 
rifle on duty. 

Patrol Rifles will be signed out only by Designated Riflemen and will 
be physically  and  visually  inspected  at  the  beginning and the  end of 
each tour of duty. 

During  the  tour  of  duty,  the  patrol  rifle  will  be  secured  in  a  vehicle 
mount with the safety “on”, bolt forward on an empty chamber and a 
loaded magazine in the magazine well.  

Upon  completion  of  each  tour,  every  patrol  rifle  will  be  stored  in 
locked  safes  located  at  each  Section/Unit,  unloaded  with  the 
magazine removed and bolt locked open.  

The  decision  to  deploy  the  rifle  will  be  made  by  the  Designated 
Rifleman and/or the supervisor on scene. Typical deployments would

include,  but  not  limited  to:  hostage  situations,  barricaded  subjects, 
sniper  situations,  active  shooters,  or  any  other  incidents  where 
deployment of the rifle would be appropriate. 

1. 

The  patrol  rifle  will  not  be  deployed  or  used  in  situations 
involving  a  civil  demonstration,  protest,  or  crowd  control 
unless  exigent  circumstances  exist  involving  a  threat  from 
firearms,  explosives, or other dangerous weapons.  

Deployment  of  a  patrol  rifle  is  not  to  be  used  as  a  substitute  for  a 
SWAT response. If the situation merits a SWAT response, the on-scene 
supervisor  should  request  SWAT  through  the  prescribed  chain  of 
command.  

Nothing  above  shall  preclude  an  officer,  in  emergency  or  exigent 
circumstances,  from  deploying  the  rifle  in  any  fashion  to  protect 
himself  or  another  person,  provided  said  actions  are  consistent  with 
law  and  departmental  policy  and  training  relative  to  the  use  of  the 
patrol rifle, the use of force, and/or the use of deadly physical force. 

V. 

GUIDELINES  –  LESS  LETHAL  SHOTGUN  AND  KINETIC  ENERGY 
IMPACT PROJECTILES 

Only  those  members  who  have  successfully  completed  the  specific 
Department approved training and have demonstrated proficiency in 
the use of less lethal force shotguns will be authorized to deploy KEIP. 

Only  Department  approved  KEIP  and  shotguns  assigned  for  their 
exclusive  use  will  be  authorized  for  use  by  trained  members.    The 
only  weapon  designated  for  use  with  less  lethal  ammunition  is  the 
RPD’s  Remington  870  shotgun,  12  gauge,  pump  action,  with  orange 
colored  stocks  to  differentiate  them  from  the  standard  RPD  issued 
shotgun.   

Less lethal shotguns will be stored unloaded in a rifle case in the trunk 
of marked patrol vehicles.  The weapon is to remain in its case in the 
trunk until needed for field use situations or routine maintenance.  It 
is  not  to  be  placed  in  the  shotgun  rack  in  the  interior  of  the  patrol 
vehicle.  Only KEIP will be stored in the rifle case and used with less 
lethal shotguns.

KEIP  should  only  be  used  when  lesser  levels  of  force  have  been 
unsuccessful  or  their  use  is  inappropriate,  as  defined  by  the  use  of 
force continuum. 

Use  of  KEIP  will  be  at  the  discretion  of  the  authorized  member  once 
on scene, and with supervisory approval when there is time to obtain 
approval. 

The member with the less lethal shotgun should formulate a plan and 
be prepared to implement it.  The plan should include, at a minimum: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Deadly physical force coverage by another member; 

A takedown team of a least two (2) members; 

Notification to all members on scene that impact projectiles are 
going  to  be  deployed  to  prevent  the  firing  of  unintentional 
deadly physical force rounds, unless done so with cause. 

Providing  the  subject  with  an  opportunity  to  comply.    The 
subject  should  not  be  forewarned  of  being  struck  with  impact 
projectiles, as this will only diminish any desired effect. 

All impact projectiles that are fired at and strike any person in a field 
use  situation  will  be  processed  and  preserved  as  evidence  by  an 
Evidence Technician. 

VI.  GUIDELINES – LESS LETHAL PEPPERBALL LAUNCHING SYSTEM 

Only  those  members  who  have  successfully  completed  the  specific 
Department approved training and have demonstrated proficiency in 
the use of PLS will be authorized to deploy same. 

Only Department approved PLS will be authorized for use by trained 
members.   

C.  When  not  in  use,  the  PLS  will  be  stored  in  a  designated,  secure 

location that is only accessible by certified users. 

D.  When deploying the PLS a member will make a notification over the 

police radio that they are on scene.

Department approved training and have demonstrated proficiency in 
the use of CEW’s will be authorized to deploy same. 

Only  currently  approved  Department  CEW’s  will  be  authorized  for 
use by trained members.   

The  CEW  should  only  be used  when  lesser  levels  of  force  have  been 
unsuccessful  or  their  use  is  inappropriate,  as  defined  by  the  use  of 
force continuum.  All applications of the TASER CEW are listed on the 
force  continuum  at  level  3  on  a  subject  who  is  demonstrating 
assaultive behavior. 

D.  Members  are  authorized  to  use  CEW’s  on  subjects  who  demonstrate 
“Assaultive Behavior” as defined by the use of force continuum. The 
CEW  should  only  be  applied  to  a  handcuffed  subject  who  is
