A.  This directive outlines the proper use of force, particularly in situations involving the 
 
use of the baton/ASP, Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Pepper Spray, Electronic Control 
  Weapon (ECW), and other force which may be used by police as well as the required  
reporting of incidents in which officers are called upon to use less than deadly force.   
 
The use of deadly force is fully covered in Directive 10.

II.  POLICY 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

A.  The primary duty of all police officers is to preserve human life.  Only the minimal  
amount of force necessary to protect life or to effect an arrest should be used by an 
 
officer.  Excessive force and/or gratuitous use of any force will not be tolerated.   
 
  Officers should exercise all safe and reasonable means of control and containment,  
 
 
  Continuum” which are: 

using only the amount of force necessary to overcome resistance.  The application of  
force by a police officer should be guided by principles found in the “Force  

* Officer presence 
* Verbal commands 
* Physical control 
* Less than lethal force 
* Deadly force

*3 

B.  RENDERING MEDICAL AID – After employing any force including lethal or less  
 
 
 
 

than lethal weapons, officers shall render appropriate medical aid and request  
further medical assistance, when necessary, for the suspect and any other injured  
individuals, as soon as it is safe to do so.  Any aid provided shall be documented in  
the appropriate report. 

C.  Additionally, personnel will not unnecessarily or unreasonably endanger themselves 
 

and others in applying these guidelines to actual situations. 

DIRECTIVE 22 - 2 

D.  Though many officers may be at the scene of a police incident where force is being 
 
used, some officers may not be directly involved in taking police action.  As officers,  
  we have an obligation to protect the public and other officers.  Therefore, it shall be the 
duty of every officer present at any scene where force is being applied to either stop or 
 
attempt to stop another officer when force is no longer required.  Your actions will both 
 
protect the officer from civil or criminal liability and the civilian from serious injury. 
 

E.  As outlined in Section VI, Use of Force Notification Procedure, IAD must be informed  
  when: 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

results.

PURPOSE 

The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance and direction on the use of the Electronic  
Control Weapon (ECW) in the context of the Use of Force Continuum.  

It is the policy of the Philadelphia Police Department to use only reasonable and necessary  
force to overcome the resistance put forth by individuals who are violent, exhibiting  
threatening behavior, or physically resisting arrest.  All ECW training will conform to this  
policy.

Active Aggression: A threat or overt act of an assault (through physical or verbal  
 
 
 

Pulling the trigger to activate an ECW that does not have an air cartridge  
installed.  This may be done while the ECW in contact with a subject (i.e. Drive  
Stun mode) or in a non-contact situation, such as to test the ECW (i.e. Spark  
Test). 

Air Cartridge  Replaceable cartridge for the ECW which uses compressed nitrogen to fire  
two barbed probes with thin connecting wires sending a current signal into  
 
the subject. 
 

Active Resistance:  A subject’s physical actions to defeat an officer’s attempt at control  
 
 

  means), coupled with the present ability to carry out the threat or  
assault, which reasonably indicates that an assault or injury to any  
 
person is imminent. 
 

Activation or Activating:  The act of pulling the trigger of an ECW, either intentionally or 
 

and to avoid being taken into custody.  Verbal statements alone do not  
constitute active resistance. 

accidentally, causing it to arc or to discharge probes.

Confetti Tags:  Small identifying cards expelled from an ECW air cartridge when probes  
are discharged.  Each confetti tag contains a serial number unique to the  
 
specific air cartridge used.  Confetti tags are also referred to as “Anti-Felon  
 
Identification “(AFID) tags. 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

Cycle  The time during which electrical impulses are emitted from the ECW following  
activation.  In most ECWs, a standard cycle is five (5) seconds for each trigger  
 
pull.  The duration of a cycle may be shortened by turning the ECW off.  The  
 
duration of the cycle may be extended in certain models by continuing to pull the  
 
trigger. 
 

 
 
 
 

Display:  Drawing or exhibiting the ECW as part of a warning tactic, typically  
 

accompanied by appropriate verbalization. 

 

 

Drive Stun:  A secondary function of an ECW.  Drive Stun is possible when the ECW  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

air cartridge has been expended or removed from the ECW or when the  
probes are deployed at close range with minimal spread.  This action  
requires pulling the trigger and placing the ECW in direct contact with a  
subject, causing the electrical energy to directly enter the subject or firing  
the probes at close range.  Drive stun is frequently used as a non- 
incapacitating compliance technique.  It may also be used to incapacitate a  
subject where at least one probe is attached to he subject’s body and the  
ECW contact will complete the circuit. 

   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Duration:  The aggregate time that the ECW is activated.  The duration of activation  
    may differ from the duration of time that a subject is exposed to electrical  
 
   
 

impulses from an ECW. 

 
 

Electronic Control Weapon (ECW)U
 
 
 

  
  
  

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

U:  A weapon primarily designed to discharge a chain  

of small electrical charges into the subject sufficient  
to cause uncontrolled muscle contractions and  
override the subject’s voluntary motor responses. 

Laser Painting: 
 
 
 
 

The act of unholstering and pointing an ECW at a subject and  
  turning on the ECWs laser aiming dot to show the device is aimed at the  
  subject. 

 
 

 
 

Passive Resistance:  
 
 
 
 

   
   

 
 

 
 

 
 

Physical actions to do not prevent the officer’s attempt to control.  
(i.e. a person who remains in a limp, prone position, passive  
demonstrators, etc.). 

Probes: 
   
 
 
   
 
 
   
 
 

Small projectiles with wires contained in an ECW air cartridge.  When the  
ECW is  activated, probes are expelled from the ECW and penetrate the  
subject’s clothing and/or skin, allowing for the application of the electrical  
impulse. 

                                                                                                               APPENDIX “A”

Probe Mode:  The primary setting on an ECW that allows the system’s propulsion system  
to deploy two small probes that are attached to the ECW by insulated wires  
 
at distance up to 25 feet. 
 

Use of Force Continuum:  A training model or philosophy that supports the progression  
and reasonable escalation and de-escalation of officer-applied  
 
force in proportional response to the action and level of  
 
resistance offered by a subject.  The level of response is based  
 
upon the situation encountered at the scene and the actions of  
 
the subject in response to the officer’s commands.  Such  
 
response may progress from the officer’s physical presence at  
 
the scene to the application of deadly force.

IV.  PROCEDURE 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

2.  To continue carrying an ECW, all personnel initially authorized to carry an  
 
 
 
  made. 

  NOTE: Officers that have successfully completed the Crisis Intervention Training  
 
 
 

3.  Other personnel authorized to carry an ECW will be permitted to sign out an ECW  
at the beginning of the tour and the information will be recorded on the Daily  
 
Complaint Summary (75-67). 
 

4.  Only Departmentally issued ECWs shall be carried by authorized personnel.  The  
use of privately owned ECWs, holsters or other related equipment is strictly  
 
prohibited. 
 

ECW must undergo recertification training annually.  Any personnel who fail to  
undergo recertification training and/or qualification shall be prohibited from  
carrying ECW until such time that recertification training and/or qualification is  

(CIT) will be issued an ECW.  These officers are responsible for the safe  
handling and storage of this equipment while off duty.  The protocols of  
this Appendix shall apply equally to any off duty actions. 

1.  Only those officers/supervisors who have successfully completed the approved,  
 

basic ECW training shall be authorized to carry an ECW. 

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 
 

 
 

                                                                                                               APPENDIX “A” 

DIRECTIVE 22 - 3  

B.  Device Readiness 

1.  The ECW shall be carried in an approved holster on the side of the body opposite  
 

the service handgun. 

2.  The ECW shall be carried fully armed with the safety on in preparation for  
 

immediate use. 

3.  The ECW shall be set in “Probe Mode” as the primary setting option with “Drive  
 

Stun Mode” used as a secondary option. 

4.  Officers/Supervisors shall be issued one spare air cartridge as a backup.  The spare  
 
air cartridge shall be stored and carried in a manner consistent with training and  
  will be replaced consistent with the manufacturer’s expiration requirements. 

5.  The ECWs energy level shall be checked and a spark test done prior to taking the  
ECW out on patrol.  This is accomplished by first removing the air cartridge, then  
 
turning the power switch on, pulling the trigger then turning the unit off as soon as  
 
a spark is seen.  A visible spark between the electrodes at the front of the ECW will  
 
show the unit is functioning properly.  Point the ECW in a safe direction prior to  
 
spark test.

red, depending on the age of the unit.  This indicator in and of itself does not ensure  
that the components of the ECW are performing properly; it only indicates the unit  
has power.  If there is no red LED visible then return the unit to Firearms Training  

7.  The battery indicator on the Taser model X26 Taser® is visible on the central  
information display.  This indicator in and of itself does not guarantee that the  
 
components of the Taser are performing properly  When the display indicates less  
 
than twenty (20) firings remaining return the unit to the Firearms Training Unit. 
 

C.  Activating the ECW 

1.  The ECW shall only be activated against persons who are exhibiting active  
 
 

aggression or active resistance in a manner that, in the officer’s judgment, is likely  
to result in injuries to themselves or others. 

2.  A warning shall be given to a person prior to activating the ECW unless to do so  
  would place any other person at risk.

3.  Personnel should not intentionally simultaneously activate more than one (1) ECW  
 

against a person. 

4.  Personnel may activate an ECW against an aggressive animal, but only if doing  
  will not unnecessarily jeopardize the safety of the officer or civilians present. 

5.  Whenever an ECW is about to be used, it is the responsibility of the activating  
 
 

officer to make sure other officers on the scene understand that the ECW is being  
activated by announcing “TASER” several times before being discharging. 

6.  Personnel should not intentionally target sensitive areas (e.g. head, neck, genitalia,  
 

etc.) 

7.  When activating an ECW, personnel should use it for one (1) standard cycle (a  
standard cycle is five (5) seconds) and should evaluate the situation to determine if  
 
 
subsequent cycles are necessary.  Personnel should consider that exposure to  
  multiple activations, continuous cycling, and exposure to the ECW longer than  
fifteen (15) seconds may increase the risk of death or serious injury.  Any  
 
subsequent activation should be independently justifiable and should be weighed  
 
against other force options. 
 

8.  To minimize the number of cycles needed to overcome resistance and bring the  
subject under control, once it is announced that an ECW in being activated, all  
 
officers on scene should attempt to secure the subject while incapacitated by ECW  
 
power or immediately thereafter.  All Officers on scene must also be prepared for  
 
an ECW to be ineffective and immediately transition to other force options if  
 
necessary. 
 

  NOTE: In determining the need for additional energy cycles, officers must be  
 
 

aware that an energized subject may not be able to respond to  
commands  during or immediately following exposure. 

 
 

 
 

9.  Drive Stun is a secondary function of an ECW. Personnel must be aware that  
 
 
 
 
 
  motor responses. 

using an ECW in Drive Stun is OFTEN INEFFECTIVE in INCAPACITATING a  
subject.  However, it may be used to effectively incapacitate a subject where at  
least one probe is attached to the subject’s body and the ECW contact will  
complete the circuit (i.e. provide the second electrical contact to a subject) by  
creating uncontrolled muscle contractions and overriding the subject’s voluntary

b.  Against an unarmed suspect attempting to elude capture by fleeing that is  
  wanted for a non-violent misdemeanor, summary, or traffic offense. 

c.  For the dispersal of non-violent persons, disorderly crowds, or in situations  
  where people are exercising their Constitutional Rights of free speech or  
 

assembly; 

d.  At random or as a threat to gain compliance or information; 

e.  In any environment where an officer reasonably believes that a flammable,  
 
 

volatile, or explosive material is present, including but not limited to gasoline,  
natural gas, propane or alcohol based Oleoresin Capsicum (O.C.) spray; 

f.  Against any elderly/frail persons, young children, or any women who appear  
pregnant or where officers receive information that the women are or may be  
 
pregnant; 
 

g.  Against a subject when in an elevated position where a fall may cause  
 

substantial injury or death; 

h.  Against subject in physical control of a vehicle in motion to include 
automobiles, trucks, motorcycles, ATVs, bicycles and scooters; 
 

i.  On handcuffed persons unless necessary to prevent the individual from harming  
 

themselves or others from serious bodily injury. 

j.  Against a subject where officers receive information that the subject has any  
 

heart ailments, conditions or has a pacemaker. 

D.  Post-Deployment 

1.  Following an ECW activation, officers should use a restraint that does not impair  
 

respiration. 

2.  All individuals who are exposed to an ECW activation shall be transported to a  
  medical facility for treatment.  If the prongs are attach to the skin of the individual,  
cut off the wires between the cartridge and the prongs, leaving a twelve (12)-inch  
 
lead, prior to transportation.  The ECW prongs should be treated as a biohazard  
 
risk. 
 

3.  If not incapacitated, the officer/supervisor firing the device will accompany the  
 
 
 
 

victim to the hospital.  Prepare a separate 75-48 for the hospital case.  Retrieve two  
(2) prongs from the hospital and place them inside cartridge holes and tape over

personnel or others, including suspects, from imminent serious bodily injury or death.   
In these extraordinary situations, written policies alone are often insufficient to properly  
evaluate the appropriateness or reasonableness of police personnel’s actions. 

B.  To fairly review these cases, maintain Departmental integrity and ensure the public is  
properly protected, the Use of Force Review Board (UFRB) will function as both an  
 
investigative and administrative tool to objectively review the appropriateness or  
 
reasonableness of force used in those extraordinary cases that could not have been  
 
reasonably foreseen when creating a written policy.  
 

A.  Strict standards in the normal application of force by police personnel are necessary to  
 
provide guidance and to safeguard the public from unnecessary or unreasonable force.   
  However, police personnel may be confronted with circumstances that were unknown  
 
or unanticipated when departmental standards were developed.  Such circumstances 
  may require extraordinary and unanticipated actions to be taken to protect police
