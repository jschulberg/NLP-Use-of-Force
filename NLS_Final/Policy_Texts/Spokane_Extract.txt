LAW ENFORCEMENT CODE OF ETHICS

To set forth, for all members of the Spokane Police Department, an articulated code
of ethics and a set of ethical canons and standards which encompass and describe
expectations of behavior and conduct, both on and off duty.

As a Law Enforcement Officer, my fundamental duty is to serve mankind;
to
safeguard lives and property; to protect the innocent against deception, the weak
against oppression or intimidation, and the peaceful against violence or disorder;
and to respect the Constitutional rights of all men to liberty, equality and justice.

I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all; maintain courageous calm
in the face of danger, scorn, or ridicule; develop self-restraint; and be constantly
mindful of the welfare of others. Honest in thought and deed in both my personal
and official life, I will be exemplary in obeying the laws of the land and the regulations
of my department. Whatever I see or hear of a confidential nature or that is confided
to me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret unless revelation is necessary
in the performance of my duty.

I will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, animosities,
or friendships to influence my decisions. With no compromise for crime and
with relentless prosecution of criminals, I will enforce the law courteously and
fear or favor, malice or violence and never accepting
appropriately without
gratuities.

I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith, and I accept it as a
public trust to be held so long as I am true to the ethics of the police service. I will
constantly strive to achieve these objectives and ideals, dedicating myself before
God to my chosen profession...law enforcement.

A. PREAMBLE

Whereas, members of the Spokane Police Department are vested with public trust
which requires that they consistently demonstrate the highest degree of integrity
and good moral character; and

integrity,
the need to maintain high standards of moral character,
Whereas,
knowledge, and trust requires the establishment of a code of professional conduct
and responsibility for members of the Spokane Police Department as a matter
of the highest significance to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of this
state; and

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Whereas, the establishment of a code of professional conduct and responsibility of
members of the Spokane Police Department, which includes canons of ethics and
minimum standards, requires the granting of authority to enforce these standards
of professional conduct through disciplinary action as necessary for the protection
of the health, welfare and safety of the public; therefore

Be it resolved that the need to maintain high standards of moral character, integrity,
knowledge and trust requires that members of the Spokane Police Department
establish and conform to a code of professional conduct and responsibility for
members of the Spokane Police Department.

B. GENERAL STATEMENT

Members of the Spokane Police Department are granted a public trust which
requires that they consistently demonstrate the highest degree of integrity. To be
worthy of this public trust and to ensure that their professional conduct is above
reproach, members of the Spokane Police Department must not only conform
to a code of ethics, but must also abide by these canons of ethics and ethical
standards which constitute this code of professional conduct and responsibility as
a means of internal regulation. The essence of a profession is that it requires,
in addition to prescribing a desired level of performance, established minimum
standards of ethical conduct with prescribed rules for internal discipline to ensure
compliance. Accordingly, this code of professional conduct and responsibility has
been established for members of the Spokane Police Department.

Nothing in the code of professional conduct and responsibility for members of the
Spokane Police Department is intended to limit or supersede any provisions of law
relating to the duties and obligations of individuals or the consequences of a violation
thereof. Whereas these rules specify certain conduct as unprofessional, this is not
to be interpreted as approval of conduct not specifically mentioned.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

100.1
Law enforcement officers are granted the authority to perform their function based on
established legal authority. This department does not tolerate abuse of law enforcement
authority.

PEACE OFFICER POWERS

100.2
Sworn members of this department shall be considered peace officers as defined by RCW
9A.04.110(13) and 9A.04.110(15). The authority of any such peace officer to make an arrest
without a warrant is enumerated in RCW 10.31.100, and includes:

(a) When the peace officer has probable cause to believe that a person has committed or
is committing a felony shall have the authority to arrest the person without a warrant.

(b) A peace officer may arrest a person without a warrant for committing a misdemeanor
or gross misdemeanor only when the offense is committed in the presence of the
officer, except as provided in RCW 10.31.100, subsections (1) through (10).

OTHER AUTHORITY

100.2.1
Sworn members of this department have Oregon peace officer authority whenever the
officer enters Oregon in order to provide or attempt to provide specific law enforcement
assistance and such assistance occurs no more than 50 miles from the Washington border.

Pursuant to Oregon law, such authority shall only apply when the officer has entered
Oregon:

(a)

(b)

(c)

In response to a request for law enforcement assistance initiated by an Oregon sheriff,
constable, marshal, municipal police officer or member of the Oregon State Police.

In response to a reasonable belief that emergency law enforcement assistance is
necessary to preserve life and circumstances make it impractical for Oregon law
enforcement officials to formally request assistance.

For the purpose of assisting Oregon law enforcement officials with emergency
assistance in response to criminal activity, traffic accidents, emergency incidents or
other similar public safety situations, an Oregon law enforcement official is present
at the scene of the incident.

Whenever practicable, officers should seek permission from a department supervisor before
entering Oregon to provide law enforcement services. As soon as practicable, officers
exercising law enforcement authority in Oregon shall submit any appropriate written reports
concerning the incident to the Oregon agency having primary jurisdiction over the area in
which the incident occurred.

Officers who enter Oregon to assist in such situations have no authority to enforce Oregon
traffic or motor vehicle laws.

Any officer absent, for any reason, for a period of more than six months, shall be
assigned to the Training Academy for a minimum of one shift. This shall occur prior
to their being assigned in any capacity to their primary duty post.

It shall be the responsibility of the Training Unit in cooperation with the officer and
the officer's immediate supervisor to design and implement a re-integration training
program. This program will be designed to fit the unique needs of the officer taking
into account their seniority, position, length of time absent, and known skill sets.

The Training Unit will also act as coordinator for any certifications, equipment or
qualifications the officer may be required to have or that require updating.

All re-entry, re-integration training shall be designed for the skills and training
necessary for a smooth transition back to their primary assigned position.

Daily Training Bulletins

The Lexipol Daily Training Bulletins (DTBs) are contained in a web-accessed system that
provides training on the Spokane Police Department policy manual and other important
topics. Generally, one training bulletin is available for each day of the month. However, the
number of DTBs may be adjusted by the DTB training coordinator.

Personnel assigned to participate in DTBs shall only use login credentials assigned to them
by the DTB training coordinator. Personnel should not share their password with others
and should frequently change their password to protect the security of the system. After
each session, employees should logoff the system to prevent unauthorized access. The
content of the DTBs is copyrighted material and shall not be shared with others outside of
the department.

Employees who are assigned to participate in the DTB program should complete each
DTB at the beginning of their shift or as otherwise directed by their supervisor. Employees
should not allow uncompleted DTBs to build up over time. Personnel may be required to
complete DTBs missed during extended absences (e.g., vacation, medical leave) upon
returning to duty. Although the DTB system can be accessed from any Internet active
computer, employees shall only take DTBs as part of their on-duty assignment unless
directed otherwise by a supervisor.

Supervisors will be responsible for monitoring the progress of personnel under their
command to ensure compliance with this policy. A random, monthly audit for completion
of the monthly DTBs will be performed by the Training Unit on the 15th of each month,
looking at the previous month. For those members whose DTBs are not completed, an
e-mail will be sent to them and their immediate supervisor.

Electronic Mail

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

212.1
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the proper use and application of
electronic mail (e-mail) by employees of this department. E-mail is a communication tool
available to employees to enhance efficiency in the performance of job duties and is to
be used in accordance with generally accepted business practices and current law (e.g.,
Washington Public Disclosure Act).

E-MAIL RIGHT OF PRIVACY

212.2
All e-mail messages, including any attachments, that are transmitted over department
the
networks are considered department records and therefore are the property of
department. The Department reserves the right to access, audit or disclose, for any lawful
reason, any message, including any attachment, that is transmitted over its e-mail system
or that is stored on any department system.

The e-mail system is not a confidential system and therefore is not appropriate for
confidential communications.
If a communication must be confidential, an alternative
method to communicate the message should be used. Employees using the department
e-mail system shall have no expectation of privacy concerning communications transmitted
over the system.

Employees should not use personal accounts to exchange e-mail or other information that
is related to the official business of the Department.

PROHIBITED USE OF E-MAIL

212.3
Sending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, disrespectful, sexually suggestive, harassing
or any other inappropriate messages on the e-mail system is prohibited and will not be
tolerated.

E-mail messages addressed to the entire department are only to be used for official
business related items that are of particular interest to all. Personal advertisements are
not acceptable.

It is a violation of this policy to transmit a message under another user's name. Users are
strongly encouraged to log off the network when their computer is unattended. This added
security measure would prevent the misuse of an individual's e-mail, name and/or password
by others.

Employees are allowed limited use of equipment and facilities to access the e-mail system
for purposes other than that directly or indirectly related to the activities of the city under the
following, but not limited to, conditions:

(a)

(b)

(c)

The use causes no additional cost to the City of Spokane.

The equipment being utilized to access the Internet shall be that which is normally
utilized by the employee, and there shall be no disruption/disturbance to another
employee's work area.

Time spent processing personal e-mail does not negatively impact the employee's
ability to do his/her job.

(d) Use of the equipment does not disrupt other city functions.

(e) Does not violate any other city policy.

212.4 MANAGEMENT OF E-MAIL
User email, stored in the inbox and sent items on the city maintained email server, will be
stored for a period of thirty days (one month). At that time, older messages will be moved
to the city's email archiving system. However, a link to these messages will remain in the
inbox for another 30 days. System mailboxes other than the inbox and sent items box will
not be archived and no voicemail messages, regardless of location, will be archived. Once
mail has been moved to the vault, messages will be retained for seven years. Users of
e-mail are solely responsible for the management of their local mailboxes. All messages
maintained in a local mailbox that are not public records, or are duplicates of the master
record, should be deleted monthly by the e-mail recipient unless necessary for on-going
business of the department.

E-mail messages are public records when they are created or received in the transaction
of public business and retained as evidence of official policies, actions, decisions or
transactions. E-mail messages should be managed by their category in compliance with
the current Records Management Guidelines and General Records Retention Schedules
(Schedule Number L08 "Electronic Mail"). The Local Government General Records
Retention Schedule (LGGRRS) is the controlling schedule for records retention and
management (RCW Chapter 40.14).

Policy Manual

Concealed Pistol License

The Chief of Police is required to check with the National Crime Information Center, the
Washington State Patrol electronic data base, the Department of Social and Health Services
electronic data base, and with other agencies or resources as appropriate, to determine
whether the applicant is ineligible under RCW 9.41.040 or RCW 9.41.045 to possess a
firearm and therefore ineligible for a concealed pistol license. This subsection applies for a
new concealed pistol license or to renew a concealed pistol license.

The license application shall bear the full name, residential address, telephone number
at the option of the applicant, date and place of birth, race, gender, physical description,
not more than two complete sets of fingerprints, and signature of the licensee, and
the licensee's driver's license number or state identification card number if used for
identification in applying for the license. A signed application for a concealed pistol license
shall constitute a waiver of confidentiality and written request that the Department of Social
and Health Services, mental health institutions, and other health care facilities release
information relevant to the applicant's eligibility for a concealed pistol license to an inquiring
court or law enforcement agency.

The applicant shall not be required to produce a birth certificate or other evidence of
citizenship. A person who is not a citizen of the United States shall meet the additional
requirements of RCW 9.41.173. The license may be in triplicate or in a form to be
prescribed by the Department of Licensing.

The application for an original license shall include two complete sets of fingerprints to be
forwarded to the Washington State Patrol (RCW 9.41.070 (4)).

218.3.1
The license and application shall contain a warning substantially as follows:

REQUIRED WARNINGS

 CAUTION: Although state and local laws do not differ, federal law and state law on the
possession of firearms differ. If you are prohibited by federal law from possessing a firearm,
you may be prosecuted in federal court. A state license is not a defense to a federal
prosecution. 

The license shall contain a description of the major differences between state and federal
law and an explanation of the fact that local laws and ordinances on firearms are preempted
by state law and must be consistent with state law. The application shall contain questions
about the applicant's eligibility under RCW 9.41.040 to possess a pistol, the applicant's
place of birth, and whether the applicant is a United States citizen.

DOCUMENTATION AND FEES

218.3.2
The Chief of Police or designee shall deliver the original copy of the application to the
licensee, within seven days send the duplicate to the Director of Licensing and shall
preserve the triplicate for six years.

The nonrefundable fee for the original five-year license must be paid upon application.
Additional charges imposed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation are payable by the
applicant. No other state or local branch or unit of government may impose any additional
charges on the applicant for the issuance of the license.

A nonrefundable fee for the renewal of such license, or the replacement of lost or damaged
licenses is required of the licensee. No other branch or unit of government may impose any
additional charges on the licensee for the renewal of the license.

or after the expiration date of the license. A license so renewed shall take effect on the
expiration date of the prior license. A licensee renewing after the expiration date of the
license must pay a late renewal penalty in addition to the renewal fee (RCW 9.41.070(9)).

An active duty member of the armed forces who is unable to renew his/her license within the
prescribed time period because of assignment, reassignment or deployment for out-of-state
military service may renew his/her license within 90 days after returning to Washington
State. Verification for this CPL renewal exception is subject to the requirements of RCW
9.41.070(14).

TEMPORARY EMERGENCY LICENSE

218.5
The Chief of Police may issue a temporary emergency license for good cause to an applicant
who resides within his/her jurisdiction pending review. However, a temporary emergency
license issued under this subsection shall not exempt the holder of the license from any
records check requirement. The Chief of Police shall assure temporary emergency licenses
are easily distinguishable from regular licenses.

REVOCATION OF LICENSES

218.6
The Chief of Police or designee shall revoke any license issued pursuant to this policy
immediately upon:

(a) Discovery that the person was ineligible under RCW 9.41.070 for a concealed pistol

license when applying for the license or license renewal.

(b) Conviction of the licensee of an offense, or commitment of the licensee for mental
health treatment, that makes a person ineligible under RCW 9.41.040 to possess a
firearm.

(c) Conviction of the licensee for a third violation of RCW Chapter 9.41 within five calendar

years.

(d) An order that the licensee forfeit a firearm under RCW 9.41.098(1)(d).

right to possess a firearm as identified in RCW 9.41.047.

INELIGIBILITY

218.6.1
Upon discovering a person issued a concealed pistol license was ineligible for the license,
the Chief of Police or designee shall contact the Department of Licensing to determine
whether the person purchased a pistol while in possession of the license.
If the person
did purchase a pistol while in possession of the concealed pistol license, and if the person
may not lawfully possess a pistol without a concealed pistol license, the Chief of Police
or designee shall require the person to present satisfactory evidence of having lawfully
transferred ownership of the pistol. The Chief of Police or designee shall require the person
to produce the evidence within fifteen days of the revocation of the license.

revocation of a license.

RECIPROCITY

218.7
The Chief of Police will recognize the validity of a concealed pistol license issued from
another state if the laws of that state recognize and give effect to a concealed pistol license
issued under the laws of the State of Washington (RCW 9.41.073). A nonresident so
licensed is authorized to carry a concealed pistol in this state if:

Chapter 3 - General Operations

Policy

300

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Use of Force

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

300.1
This policy provides guidelines on the reasonable use of force. While there is no way to
specify the exact amount or type of reasonable force to be applied in any situation, every
member of this department is expected to use these guidelines to make such decisions in
a professional, impartial and reasonable manner.

300.1.1
Definitions related to this policy include:

DEFINITIONS

Deadly force - Force reasonably anticipated to create a substantial likelihood of causing
death or very serious bodily injury.

Force - The application of physical techniques or tactics, chemical agents or weapons to
another person. It is not a use of force when a person allows him/herself to be searched,
escorted, handcuffed or restrained.

POLICY

300.2
The use of force by law enforcement personnel is a matter of critical concern, both to
the public and to the law enforcement community. Officers are involved on a daily basis
in numerous and varied interactions and, when warranted, may use reasonable force in
carrying out their duties.

Officers must have an understanding of, and true appreciation for, their authority and
limitations. This is especially true with respect to overcoming resistance while engaged in
the performance of law enforcement duties.

The Department recognizes and respects the value of all human life and dignity without
prejudice to anyone. Vesting officers with the authority to use reasonable force and to
protect the public welfare requires monitoring, evaluation and a careful balancing of all
interests.

DUTY TO INTERCEDE

300.2.1
Any officer present and observing another officer using force that is clearly beyond that
which is objectively reasonable under the circumstances shall, when in a position to do
so, intercede to prevent the use of unreasonable force. An officer who observes another
employee use force that exceeds the degree of force permitted by law should promptly
report these observations to a supervisor.

300.3 USE OF FORCE
Use of deadly force like any force used by an officer, must be objectively reasonable based
on the totality of the fact and circumstances known to the officer at the time the force is
used.

The "reasonableness" of force will be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer
on the scene at the time of the incident. Any evaluation of reasonableness must allow for
the fact that officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of

Use of Force - 46

Adopted: 2013/04/09 © 1995-2013 Lexipol, LLC

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Use of Force

force that reasonably appears necessary in a particular situation, with limited information
and in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving.

Given that no policy can realistically predict every possible situation an officer might
encounter, officers are entrusted to use well-reasoned discretion in determining the
appropriate use of force in each incident.

It is also recognized that circumstances may arise in which officers reasonably believe that
it would be impractical or ineffective to use any of the tools, weapons or methods provided
by the Department. Officers may find it more effective or reasonable to improvise their
response to rapidly unfolding conditions that they are confronting. In such circumstances,
the use of any improvised device or method must nonetheless be reasonable and utilized
only to the degree that reasonably appears necessary to accomplish a legitimate law
enforcement purpose.

While the ultimate objective of every law enforcement encounter is to avoid or minimize
injury, nothing in this policy requires an officer to retreat or be exposed to possible physical
injury before applying reasonable force.

USE OF FORCE TO EFFECT AN ARREST

300.3.1
An officer may use force which reasonably appears to be necessary to effect an arrest if,
after notice of the intention to arrest the person, he/she either flees or forcibly resists (RCW
10.31.050).

FACTORS USED TO DETERMINE THE REASONABLENESS OF FORCE

300.3.2
When determining whether to apply force and evaluating whether an officer has used
reasonable force, a number of factors should be taken into consideration, as time and
circumstances permit. These factors include, but are not limited to:

Immediacy and severity of the threat to officers or others.

The conduct of the individual being confronted, as reasonably perceived by the officer
at the time.

(c) Officer/subject factors (age, size, relative strength, skill level, injuries sustained, level

of exhaustion or fatigue, the number of officers available vs. subjects).

(d)

The effects of drugs or alcohol.

(e) Subject's mental state or capacity.

Proximity of weapons or dangerous improvised devices.

The degree to which the subject has been effectively restrained and his/her ability to
resist despite being restrained.

(h)

The availability of other options and their possible effectiveness.

Seriousness of the suspected offense or reason for contact with the individual.

Training and experience of the officer.

Potential for injury to officers, suspects and others.

(l) Whether the person appears to be resisting, attempting to evade arrest by flight or is

attacking the officer.

(m) The risk and reasonably foreseeable consequences of escape.

(n)

The apparent need for immediate control of the subject or a prompt resolution of the
situation.

(q) Any other exigent circumstances.

PAIN COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES

300.3.3
Pain compliance techniques may be effective in controlling a physically or actively
resisting individual. Officers may apply those pain compliance techniques for which they
have successfully completed department-approved training. Officers utilizing any pain
compliance technique should consider:

(a)

The degree to which the application of the technique may be controlled given the level
of resistance.

(b) Whether the person can comply with the direction or orders of the officer.

(c) Whether the person has been given sufficient opportunity to comply.

The application of any pain compliance technique shall be discontinued once the officer
determines that compliance has been achieved.

NECK RESTRAINT CONTROL HOLD

300.3.4
The proper application of a level one or a level two neck restraint hold may be effective in
restraining a violent or combative individual. However, due to the potential for injury, the
use of the neck restraint hold is subject to the following:

(a)

(b)

(c)

The officer shall have successfully completed department-approved training in the
use and application of the neck restraint.

The neck restraint may only be used when circumstances perceived by the officer
at the time indicate that such application reasonably appears necessary to control a
person in any of the following circumstances:

The subject is violent or physically resisting.

The subject, by words or actions, has demonstrated an intention to be violent
and reasonably appears to have the potential to harm officers, him/herself or
others.

The application of a neck restraint control hold on the following individuals should
generally be avoided unless the totality of the circumstances indicates that other
available options reasonably appear ineffective, or would present a greater danger
to the officer, the subject or others, and the officer reasonably believes that the need
to control the individual outweighs the risk of applying a neck restraint control hold:

Females who are known to be pregnant

Elderly individuals

Obvious juveniles

1.

2.

1.

2.

3.

(d) Any individual who has had the neck restraint hold applied, and was rendered
unconscious, shall be promptly examined by paramedics or other qualified medical
personnel and should be monitored until examined by paramedics or other
appropriate medical personnel.

Use of Force

(e)

(f)

(g)

The officer shall inform any person receiving custody, or any person placed in a
position of providing care, that the individual has been subjected to the neck restraint
control hold and whether the subject lost consciousness as a result.

Any officer attempting or applying the neck restraint control hold shall promptly notify
a supervisor of the use or attempted use of such hold.

The use or attempted use of the neck restraint control hold shall be thoroughly
documented by the officer in any related reports. Such documentation shall be
reviewed by a supervisor for policy compliance.

DEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS

300.4
Use of deadly force like any force used by an officer, must be objectively reasonable based
on the totality of the facts and circumstances known to the officer at the time the force is
used. Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:

(a) An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she

reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.

(b) An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has
probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a
felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death,
and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily
injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended.
Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force,
where feasible.

Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist
even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For
example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the
following:

1.

2.

The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable
to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.

The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon
and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.

SHOOTING AT OR FROM MOVING VEHICLES

300.4.1
Shots fired at or from a moving vehicle are rarely effective. Officers should move out of the
path of an approaching vehicle instead of discharging their firearm at the vehicle or any of its
occupants. An officer should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants
when the officer reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert
the threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or
others.

Officers should not shoot at any part of a vehicle in an attempt to disable the vehicle.

REPORTING THE USE OF FORCE

300.5
Any use of force by a member of this department shall be documented promptly, completely
and accurately in an appropriate report, depending on the nature of the incident. The
officer should articulate the factors perceived and why he/she believed the use of force
was reasonable under the circumstances. To collect data for purposes of training, resource
allocation, analysis and related purposes, the Department may require the completion of
additional report forms, as specified in department policy, procedure or law.

NOTIFICATION TO SUPERVISORS

300.5.1
Supervisory notification shall be made as soon as practicable following the application of
force in any of the following circumstances:

(a)

(b)

The application caused a visible injury (with the exception of minor marks on the wrist
consistent with being handcuffed and minor marks to the face as a result of prone
cuffing).
The application would lead a reasonable officer to conclude that the individual may
have experienced more than momentary discomfort.
The individual subjected to the force complained of injury or continuing pain.
(c)
(d)
The individual indicates intent to pursue litigation.
(e) Any application of the TASER® device or control device.
(f)
(g)
(h) An individual was struck or kicked.
(i)

Any application of a restraint device other than handcuffs, shackles or belly chains.
The individual subjected to the force was rendered unconscious.

An individual alleges any of the above has occurred.

300.6 MEDICAL CONSIDERATION
Prior to booking or release, medical assistance shall be obtained for any person who exhibits
signs of physical distress, who has sustained visible injury, expresses a complaint of injury
or continuing pain, or who was rendered unconscious. Any individual exhibiting signs of
physical distress after an encounter should be continuously monitored until he/she can be
medically assessed.

Based upon the officer's initial assessment of the nature and extent of the subject's injuries,
medical assistance may consist of examination by fire personnel, paramedics, hospital staff
or medical staff at the jail. If any such individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal
shall be fully documented in related reports and, whenever practicable, should be witnessed
If a recording is made of the contact or an
by another officer and/or medical personnel.
interview with the individual, any refusal should be included in the recording, if possible.

The on-scene supervisor, or if not available, the primary handling officer shall ensure that
any person providing medical care or receiving custody of a person following any use of
force is informed that the person was subjected to force. This notification shall include a
description of the force used and any other circumstances the officer reasonably believes
would be potential safety or medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme
agitation, impaired respiration).

Persons who exhibit extreme agitation, violent irrational behavior accompanied by profuse
sweating, extraordinary strength beyond their physical characteristics and imperviousness
to pain (sometimes called  excited delirium ), or who require a protracted physical encounter
with multiple officers to be brought under control, may be at an increased risk of sudden
death. Calls involving these persons should be considered medical emergencies. Officers
who reasonably suspect a medical emergency should request medical assistance as soon
as practicable and have medical personnel stage away if appropriate.

SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY

300.7
When a supervisor becomes aware of an incident in which there has been a reported
application of force that requires a Use of Force Report, the supervisor shall be responsible
for the following:

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Leg Restraint Device

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

306.1
This policy provides guidelines for the use of handcuffs and other restraints during
detentions and arrests.

POLICY

306.2
The Spokane Police Department authorizes the use of restraint devices in accordance with
this policy, the Use of Force Policy and department training. Restraint devices shall not be
used to punish, to display authority or as a show of force.

306.3 USE OF RESTRAINTS
Only members who have successfully completed Spokane Police Department-approved
training on the use of restraint devices described in this policy are authorized to use these
devices.

When deciding whether to use any restraint, officers should carefully balance officer safety
concerns with factors that include, but are not limited to:
The circumstances or crime leading to the arrest.
•
The demeanor and behavior of the arrested person.
•
The age and health of the person.
•
Whether the person is known to be pregnant.
•
Whether the person has a hearing or speaking disability. In such cases, consideration
•
should be given, safety permitting, to handcuffing to the front in order to allow the
person to sign or write notes.
Whether the person has any other apparent disability.

•

RESTRAINT OF DETAINEES

306.3.1
Situations may arise where it may be reasonable to restrain an individual who may, after
brief investigation, be released without arrest. Unless arrested, the use of restraints on
detainees should continue only for as long as is reasonably necessary to assure the safety
of officers and others. When deciding whether to remove restraints from a detainee, officers
should continuously weigh the safety interests at hand against the continuing intrusion upon
the detainee.

RESTRAINT OF PREGNANT PERSONS

306.3.2
Persons who are known to be pregnant should be restrained in the least restrictive manner
that is effective for officer safety.

No person who is in labor shall be handcuffed or restrained except in extraordinary
circumstances and only when a supervisor makes an individualized determination that
such restraints are necessary to prevent escape or injury (RCW 70.48.500).

NOTIFICATIONS

306.3.3
Whenever an officer transports a person with the use of restraints other than handcuffs,
the officer shall inform the jail staff upon arrival at the jail that restraints were used. This

Policy Manual

Leg Restraint Device

notification should include information regarding any other circumstances the officer
reasonably believes would be potential safety concerns or medical risks to the subject
(e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, impaired respiration) that may have occurred
prior to, or during transportation to the jail.

APPLICATION OF HANDCUFFS OR PLASTIC CUFFS

306.4
Handcuffs, including temporary nylon or plastic cuffs, may be used only to restrain a
person's hands to ensure officer safety.

Although recommended for most arrest situations, handcuffing is discretionary and not an
absolute requirement of the Department. Officers should consider handcuffing any person
they reasonably believe warrants that degree of restraint. However, officers should not
conclude that in order to avoid risk every person should be handcuffed, regardless of the
circumstances.

In most situations handcuffs should be applied with the hands behind the person's back.
When feasible, handcuffs should be double-locked to prevent tightening, which may cause
undue discomfort or injury to the hands or wrists.

In situations where one pair of handcuffs does not appear sufficient to restrain the individual
or may cause unreasonable discomfort due to the person's size, officers should consider
alternatives, such as using an additional set of handcuffs or multiple plastic cuffs.

Handcuffs should be removed as soon as it is reasonable or after the person has been
searched and is safely confined within a detention facility.

306.4.1 MEDICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Prior to booking or release, medical assistance shall be obtained for any person who has
sustained visible injury, expressed a complaint of injury, or continuing pain, or who has
been rendered unconscious. Based upon the officer's initial assessment of the nature
and extent of the subject's injuries, medical assistance may consist of examination by fire
personnel, paramedics, hospital staff or medical staff at the jail.
If any individual refuses
medical attention, such a refusal shall be fully documented in related reports and, whenever
practical, should be witnessed by another officer and/or medical personnel.
If an audio
recording is made of the contact or an interview with the individual, any refusal should be
included, if possible.

Persons who exhibit symptoms of excited delirium such as extreme agitation, violent
irrational behavior accompanied by profuse sweating, extraordinary strength beyond their
physical characteristics, unusually high tolerance to pain or who require a protracted
physical encounter with multiple officers to bring under control, may be at an increased
risk of sudden death and should be examined by qualified medical personnel as soon
as practicable. Any individual exhibiting signs of distress after such an encounter shall
be transported to a hospital and medically cleared prior to booking. Transportation by
ambulance should be used when possible.

If any individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal shall be fully documented in related
reports and a supervisor should be notified. Whenever practicable, the refusal should be
witnessed by another officer and/or medical personnel. If an audio recording is made of the
contact or an interview with the individual, any refusal should be included, if possible.

APPLICATION OF SPIT HOODS/MASKS/SOCKS

306.5
Spit hoods/masks/socks are temporary protective devices designed to prevent the wearer
from biting and/or transferring or transmitting fluids (saliva and mucous) to others.

Spit hoods may be placed upon persons in custody when the officer reasonably believes the
person will bite or spit, either on a person or in an inappropriate place. They are generally
used during application of a physical restraint, while the person is restrained, or during or
after transport.

Officers utilizing spit hoods should ensure that the spit hood is fastened properly to allow for
adequate ventilation and that the restrained person can breathe normally. Officers should
provide assistance during the movement of restrained individuals due to the potential for
impaired or distorted vision on the part of the individual. Officers should avoid comingling
individuals wearing spit hoods with other detainees.

Spit hoods should not be used in situations where the restrained person is bleeding
profusely from the area around the mouth or nose, or if there are indications that the
person has a medical condition, such as difficulty breathing or vomiting.
In such cases,
prompt medical care should be obtained. If the person vomits while wearing a spit hood,
the spit hood should be promptly removed and discarded. A spit mask should only be
used in extreme circumstances when a person has been sprayed with oleoresin capsicum
(OC) spray.

Those who have been placed in a spit hood should be continually monitored and shall not
be left unattended until the spit hood is removed. Spit hoods shall be discarded after each
use.

APPLICATION OF AUXILIARY RESTRAINT DEVICES

306.6
Auxiliary restraint devices include transport belts, waist or belly chains, transportation
chains, leg irons and other similar devices. Auxiliary restraint devices are intended for use
during long-term restraint or transportation. They provide additional security and safety
without impeding breathing, while permitting adequate movement, comfort and mobility.

Only department-authorized devices may be used. Any person in auxiliary restraints should
be monitored as reasonably appears necessary.

APPLICATION OF LEG RESTRAINT DEVICES

306.7
Leg restraints may be used to restrain the legs of a violent or potentially violent person
when it reasonably appears necessary to do so during the course of detention, arrest or
transportation. Only restraint devices approved by the department shall be used.

In determining whether to use the leg restraint, officers should consider:

(a) Whether the officer or others could be exposed to injury due to the assaultive or

resistant behavior of a suspect.

(b) Whether it is reasonably necessary to protect the suspect from his/her own actions
(e.g., hitting his/her head against the interior of the patrol unit, running away from the
arresting officer while handcuffed, kicking at objects or officers).

(c) Whether it is reasonably necessary to avoid damage to property (e.g., kicking at

windows of the patrol unit).

306.7.1
GUIDELINES FOR USE OF LEG RESTRAINTS
When applying leg restraints the following guidelines should be followed:

(a)

If practicable, officers should notify a supervisor of the intent to apply the leg restraint
device.
In all cases, a supervisor shall be notified as soon as practicable after the
application of the leg restraint device.

(b) Once applied, absent a medical or other emergency, restraints should remain in place
until the officer arrives at the jail or other facility or the person no longer reasonably
appears to pose a threat.

(c) Once secured, the person should not be placed on his/her stomach for an extended

period, as this could reduce the person's ability to breathe.

(d)

(e)

The restrained person should be continually monitored by an officer while in the leg
restraint. The officer should ensure that the person does not roll onto and remain on
his/her stomach.

The officer should look for signs of labored breathing and take appropriate steps to
relieve and minimize any obvious factors contributing to this condition.

(f) When transported by ambulance/paramedic unit, the restrained person should be
accompanied by an officer when requested by medical personnel. The transporting
officer should describe to medical personnel any unusual behaviors or other
circumstances the officer reasonably believes would be potential safety or medical
risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, impaired respiration).

REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION

306.8
If an individual is restrained and released without an arrest, the officer shall document the
details of the detention and the need for handcuffs or other restraints.

If an individual is arrested, the use of restraints other than handcuffs shall be documented
in the related report. The officer should include, as appropriate:

(a)

The amount of time the suspect was restrained.

(b) How the suspect was transported and the position of the suspect.

(c) Observations of the suspect's behavior and any signs of physiological problems.

(d) Any known or suspected drug use or other medical problems.

TRANSPORTING RESTRAINED SUSPECTS

306.9
When transporting a suspect(s) who has been restrained, officers shall observe the
following procedures:

(a) Restrained suspects may be transported in a patrol unit. Use a blanket insertion,
placing the suspect on his/her side (left, if practical) in the rear of the patrol unit. A seat
bottom from another patrol vehicle will be placed on the floor to prevent the suspect
from falling to the floor. The clip and strapping may be secured in the door or left
attached to the cuffs, depending on the discretion of the arresting officer.

(b)

The transporting patrol unit should consist of two patrol officers. The officers will
monitor the status of the suspect while en route to jail.

(c) When taken by ambulance/paramedic unit, the suspect shall be accompanied by an

officer.

(d) Officers shall inform the jail staff that the suspect was subjected to being restrained

by use of a restraint device prior to arrival at the jail.

BATON GUIDELINES

308.5
The need to immediately control a suspect must be weighed against the risk of causing
serious injury. The head, neck, throat, spine, heart, kidneys and groin should not be
intentionally targeted except when the officer reasonably believes the suspect poses an
imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others.

When carrying a baton, uniformed personnel shall carry the baton in its authorized holder on
the equipment belt. Plainclothes and non-field personnel may carry the baton as authorized
and in accordance with the needs of their assignment or at the direction of their supervisor.

CHEMICAL MUNITIONS GUIDELINES

308.6
Chemical munitions may be used for crowd control, crowd dispersal or against barricaded
suspects based on the circumstances. Only the Shift Commander, Incident Commander
or Crisis Response Unit Commander may authorize the delivery and use of chemical
munitions, and only after evaluating all conditions known at the time and determining that
such force reasonably appears justified and necessary.

When practicable, fire personnel should be alerted or summoned to the scene prior to the
deployment of chemical munitions to control any fires and to assist in providing medical aid
or gas evacuation if needed.

308.7 OLEORESIN CAPSICUM (OC) GUIDELINES
As with other control devices, oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray and pepper projectiles may
be considered for use to bring under control an individual or groups of individuals who are
engaging in, or are about to engage in violent behavior. Pepper projectiles and OC spray
should not, however, be used against individuals or groups who merely fail to disperse or
do not reasonably appear to present a risk to the safety of officers or the public.

OC SPRAY

308.7.1
Uniformed personnel carrying OC spray shall carry the device in its holster on the equipment
belt. Plainclothes and non-field personnel may carry OC spray as authorized, in accordance
with the needs of their assignment or at the direction of their supervisor.

TREATMENT FOR OC SPRAY EXPOSURE

308.7.2
Persons who have been sprayed with or otherwise affected by the use of OC should be
promptly provided with clean water to cleanse the affected areas when it is safe for the
officer to provide such treatment. Those persons who complain of further severe effects
shall be examined by appropriate medical personnel.

POST-APPLICATION NOTICE

308.8
Whenever chemical munitions or OC has been introduced into a residence, building interior,
vehicle or other enclosed area, officers should provide the owners or available occupants
with notice of the possible presence of residue that could result in irritation or injury if the
area is not properly cleaned. Such notice should include advisement that clean up will be
at the owner's expense.
Information regarding the method of notice and the individuals
notified should be included in related reports.

Control Devices and Techniques

TWO PERSON LOADING PROCEDURES

308.8.1
Absent compelling circumstances, officers who must deploy kinetic energy/blunt impact
munitions will employ the two person rule for loading. The two-person rule is a safety
measure achieved by having a second officer watch the loading process to ensure that
the weapon is completely emptied of conventional ammunition.

308.9 KINETIC ENERGY PROJECTILE GUIDELINES
This department is committed to reducing the potential for violent confrontations. Kinetic
energy projectiles, when used properly, are less likely to result in death or serious physical
injury and can be used in an attempt to de-escalate a potentially deadly situation.

DEPLOYMENT AND USE

308.9.1
Only department-approved kinetic energy munitions shall be carried and deployed.
Approved munitions may be used to compel an individual to cease his/her actions when
such munitions present a reasonable option.

Officers are not required or compelled to use approved munitions in lieu of other reasonable
tactics if the involved officer determines that deployment of these munitions cannot be done
safely. The safety of hostages, innocent persons and officers takes priority over the safety
of subjects engaged in criminal or suicidal behavior.

Circumstances appropriate for deployment include, but are not limited to, situations in
which:
(a)

The suspect is armed with a weapon and the tactical circumstances allow for the safe
application of approved munitions.
The suspect has made credible threats to harm him/herself or others.
The suspect is engaged in riotous behavior or is throwing rocks, bottles or other
dangerous projectiles at people and/or officers.
There is probable cause to believe that the suspect has already committed a crime of
violence and is refusing to comply with lawful orders.

(b)
(c)

(d)

DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS

308.9.2
Before discharging projectiles, the officer should consider such factors as:
(a) Distance and angle to target.
Type of munitions employed.
(b)
Type and thickness of subject's clothing.
(c)
The subject's proximity to others.
(d)
(e)
The location of the subject.
(f) Whether the subject's actions dictate the need for an immediate response and the

use of control devices appears appropriate.

A verbal warning of the intended use of the device should precede its application, unless
it would otherwise endanger the safety of officers or when it is not practicable due to the
circumstances. The purpose of the warning is to give the individual a reasonable opportunity
to voluntarily comply and to warn other officers and individuals that the device is being
deployed.

Officers should keep in mind the manufacturer's recommendations and their training
regarding effective distances and target areas. However, officers are not restricted solely

Control Devices and Techniques

to use according to manufacturer recommendations. Each situation must be evaluated on
the totality of circumstances at the time of deployment.

The need to immediately incapacitate the subject must be weighed against the risk of
causing serious injury or death. The head and neck should not be intentionally targeted,
except when the officer reasonably believes the suspect poses an imminent threat of
serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others.

SAFETY PROCEDURES

308.9.3
Shotguns specifically designated for use with kinetic energy projectiles will be specially
marked in a manner that makes them readily identifiable as such.

Officers will inspect the shotgun and projectiles at the beginning of each shift to ensure that
the shotgun is in proper working order and the projectiles are of the approved type and
appear to be free from defects.

When it is not deployed, the shotgun will be unloaded and properly and securely stored in
the vehicle. When deploying the kinetic energy projectile shotgun, the officer shall visually
inspect the kinetic energy projectiles to ensure that conventional ammunition is not being
loaded into the shotgun.

Absent compelling circumstances, officers who must
transition from conventional
ammunition to kinetic energy projectiles will employ the two-person rule for loading. The
two-person rule is a safety measure in which a second officer watches the unloading
and loading process to ensure that the weapon is completely emptied of conventional
ammunition.

TRAINING FOR CONTROL DEVICES

308.10
The Training Lieutenant shall ensure that all personnel who are authorized to carry a control
device have been properly trained and certified to carry the specific control device and are
retrained or recertified as necessary.

(a) Proficiency training shall be monitored and documented by a certified, control-device

(b) All training and proficiency for control devices will be documented in the officer's

weapons or tactics instructor.

training file.

(c) Officers who fail to demonstrate proficiency with the control device or knowledge of
this agency's Use of Force Policy will be provided remedial training. If an officer cannot
demonstrate proficiency with a control device or knowledge of this agency's Use of
Force Policy after remedial training, the officer will be restricted from carrying the
control device and may be subject to discipline.

REPORTING USE OF CONTROL DEVICES AND TECHNIQUES

308.11
Any application of a control device or technique listed in this policy shall be documented in
the related incident report and reported pursuant to the Use of Force Policy.

Policy

309

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Conducted Energy Device

309.1
This policy provides guidelines for the issuance and use of TASER® devices.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

POLICY

309.2
The TASER device is intended to control a violent or potentially violent individual, while
minimizing the risk of serious injury. The appropriate use of such a device should result in
fewer serious injuries to officers and suspects.

ISSUANCE AND CARRYING TASER DEVICES

309.3
Only members who have successfully completed department-approved training may be
issued and carry the TASER device.

TASER devices are issued for use during a member's current assignment. Those leaving
a particular assignment may be required to return the device to the department's inventory.

Officers shall only use the TASER device and cartridges that have been issued by the
Department. Uniformed officers who have been issued the TASER device shall wear
the device in an approved holster on their person or in the designated pocked on their
uniform/jumpsuit. Non-uniformed officers may secure the TASER device in the driver's
compartment of their vehicle.

Members carrying the TASER device should perform a spark test on the unit prior to every
shift.

When carried while in uniform officers shall carry the TASER device on the weak-side
opposite their duty weapon.

(a) All TASER devices shall be clearly and distinctly marked to differentiate them from

the duty weapon and any other device.

(b) Whenever practicable, officers should carry two or more cartridges on their person

when carrying the TASER device.

(c) Officers shall be responsible for ensuring that their issued TASER device is properly

maintained and in good working order.

(d) Officers should not hold both a firearm and the TASER device at the same time.

VERBAL AND VISUAL WARNINGS

309.4
A verbal warning of the intended use of the TASER device should precede its application,
unless it would otherwise endanger the safety of officers or when it is not practicable due
to the circumstances. The purpose of the warning is to:
(a) Provide the individual with a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply.
(b) Provide other officers and individuals with a warning that the TASER device may be

deployed.

If, after a verbal warning, an individual is unwilling to voluntarily comply with an officer's
lawful orders and it appears both reasonable and feasible under the circumstances, the
officer may, but is not required to, display the electrical arc (provided that a cartridge has

not been loaded into the device), or the laser in a further attempt to gain compliance prior
to the application of the TASER device. The aiming laser should never be intentionally
directed into the eyes of another as it may permanently impair his/her vision.

The fact that a verbal or other warning was given or the reasons it was not given shall be
documented by the officer deploying the TASER device in the related report.

309.5 USE OF THE TASER DEVICE
The TASER device has limitations and restrictions requiring consideration before its use.
The TASER device should only be used when its operator can safely approach the subject
within the operational range of the device. Although the TASER device is generally effective
in controlling most individuals, officers should be aware that the device may not achieve the
intended results and be prepared with other options.

APPLICATION OF THE TASER DEVICE

309.5.1
The TASER device may be used in any of
circumstances perceived by the officer at
reasonably necessary to control a person:
(a)
(b)

The subject is violent or is physically resisting.
The subject has demonstrated, by words or action, an intention to be violent or to
physically resist, and reasonably appears to present the potential to harm officers,
him/herself or others.

the following circumstances, when the
the time indicate that such application is

Mere flight from a pursuing officer, without other known circumstances or factors, is not
good cause for the use of the TASER device to apprehend an individual.

Individuals who are known to be pregnant.

SPECIAL DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS

309.5.2
The use of the TASER device on certain individuals should generally be avoided unless
the totality of the circumstances indicates that other available options reasonably appear
ineffective or would present a greater danger to the officer, the subject or others, and the
officer reasonably believes that the need to control the individual outweighs the risk of using
the device. This includes:
(a)
(b) Elderly individuals or obvious juveniles.
(c)
(d)
(e)

Individuals with obviously low body mass.
Individuals who are handcuffed or otherwise restrained.
Individuals who have been recently sprayed with a flammable chemical agent or
who are otherwise in close proximity to any known combustible vapor or flammable
material, including alcohol-based oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray.
Individuals whose position or activity may result in collateral injury (e.g., falls from
height, operating vehicles).

(f)

Because the application of the TASER device in the drive-stun mode (i.e., direct contact
without probes) relies primarily on pain compliance,
the use of the drive-stun mode
generally should be limited to supplementing the probe-mode to complete the circuit, or as
a distraction technique to gain separation between officers and the subject, thereby giving
officers time and distance to consider other force options or actions.

The TASER device shall not be used to psychologically torment, elicit statements or to
punish any individual.

Policy Manual

Conducted Energy Device

TARGETING CONSIDERATIONS

309.5.3
Reasonable efforts should be made to target lower center mass and avoid the head, neck,
chest and groin. If the dynamics of a situation or officer safety do not permit the officer to
limit the application of the TASER device probes to a precise target area, officers should
monitor the condition of the subject if one or more probes strikes the head, neck, chest or
groin until the subject is examined by paramedics or other medical personnel.

309.5.4 MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS OF THE TASER DEVICE
Officers should apply the TASER device for only one standard cycle and then evaluate
the situation before applying any subsequent cycles. Multiple applications of the TASER
device against a single individual are generally not recommended and should be avoided
unless the officer reasonably believes that the need to control the individual outweighs the
potentially increased risk posed by multiple applications.

If the first application of the TASER device appears to be ineffective in gaining control of an
individual, the officer should consider certain factors before additional applications of the
TASER device, including:

(a) Whether the probes are making proper contact.

(b) Whether the individual has the ability and has been given a reasonable opportunity

to comply.

(c) Whether verbal commands, other options or tactics may be more effective.

Officers should generally not intentionally apply more than one TASER device at a time
against a single subject.

ACTIONS FOLLOWING DEPLOYMENTS

309.5.5
Officers shall notify a supervisor of all TASER device discharges. Confetti tags should
be collected and the expended cartridge, along with both probes and wire, should be
submitted into evidence. The cartridge serial number should be noted and documented
on the evidence paperwork. The evidence packaging should be marked "Biohazard" if the
probes penetrated the subject's skin.

DANGEROUS ANIMALS

309.5.6
The TASER device may be deployed against an animal as part of a plan to deal with a
potentially dangerous animal, such as a dog, if the animal reasonably appears to pose an
imminent threat to human safety and alternative methods are not reasonably available or
would likely be ineffective.

309.5.7
Officers are not authorized to carry department TASER devices while off-duty.

OFF-DUTY CONSIDERATIONS

Officers shall ensure that TASER devices are secured while in their homes, vehicles or any
other area under their control, in a manner that will keep the device inaccessible to others.

DOCUMENTATION

309.6
Officers shall document all TASER device discharges in the related arrest/crime report and
the TASER device report form. Notification shall also be made to a supervisor in compliance
with the Use of Force Policy. Unintentional discharges, pointing the device at a person, laser
activation and arcing the device will also be documented on the report form.

(e) Any known or suspected drug use, intoxication or other medical problems

309.7 MEDICAL TREATMENT
Consistent with local medical personnel protocols and absent extenuating circumstances,
only appropriate medical personnel should remove TASER device probes from a person's
body. Used TASER device probes shall be treated as a sharps biohazard, similar to a used
hypodermic needle and handled appropriately. Universal precautions should be taken.

All persons who have been struck by TASER device probes or who have been subjected
to the electric discharge of the device shall be medically assessed prior to booking.
Additionally, any such individual who falls under any of the following categories should, as
soon as practicable, be examined by paramedics or other qualified medical personnel:

(a)

The person is suspected of being under the influence of controlled substances and/or
alcohol.

a likelihood the TASER device may be used. A supervisor should respond to all incidents
where the TASER device was activated.

A supervisor should review each incident where a person has been exposed to an activation
of the TASER device. The device's onboard memory should be downloaded through the
data port by a supervisor or Rangemaster and saved with the related arrest/crime report.
Photographs of probe sites should be taken and witnesses interviewed.

TRAINING

309.9
Personnel who are authorized to carry the TASER device shall be permitted to do so only
after successfully completing the initial department-approved training. Any personnel who
have not carried the TASER device as a part of their assignment for a period of six months or
more shall be recertified by a department-approved TASER device instructor prior to again
carrying or using the device.

Proficiency training for personnel who have been issued TASER devices should occur every
year. A reassessment of an officer's knowledge and/or practical skill may be required at
any time if deemed appropriate by the Training Lieutenant. All training and proficiency for
TASER devices will be documented in the officer's training file.

Command staff, supervisors and investigators should receive TASER device training as
appropriate for the investigations they conduct and review.

Officers who do not carry TASER devices should receive training that is sufficient to
familiarize them with the device and with working with officers who use the device.

The Training Lieutenant is responsible for ensuring that all members who carry TASER
devices have received initial and annual proficiency training. Periodic audits should be used
for verification.

Vehicle Pursuit Policy

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

314.1
Vehicle pursuits expose innocent citizens, law enforcement officers and fleeing violators
to the risk of serious injury or death. The primary purpose of this policy is to provide
officers with guidance in balancing the safety of the public and themselves against law
enforcement's duty to apprehend violators of the law. Another purpose of this policy is to
minimize the potential for pursuit related collisions. Vehicular pursuits require officers to
exhibit a high degree of common sense and sound judgment. Officers must not forget that
the immediate apprehension of a suspect is generally not more important than the safety
of the public and pursuing officers.

Deciding whether to pursue a motor vehicle is a critical decision that must be made quickly
and under difficult and unpredictable circumstances.
In recognizing the potential risk to
public safety created by vehicular pursuits, no officer or supervisor shall be criticized or
disciplined for deciding not to engage in a vehicular pursuit because of the risk involved.

This includes circumstances where department policy would permit
the initiation or
continuation of the pursuit. It is recognized that vehicular pursuit situations are not always
predictable and decisions made pursuant to this policy will be evaluated according to the
totality of the circumstances reasonably available at the time of the pursuit.

Officers must remember that the most important factors to the successful conclusion of a
pursuit are proper self discipline and sound professional judgment. Officers' conduct during
the course of a pursuit must be objectively reasonable½¾ That is, what a reasonable officer
would do under the circumstances. An unreasonable individual's desire to apprehend a
fleeing suspect at all costs has no place in professional law enforcement (RCW 43.101.225).

VEHICLE PURSUIT DEFINED

314.1.1
A vehicle pursuit is an event involving one or more law enforcement officers attempting
to apprehend a suspect who is attempting to avoid apprehension while operating a motor
vehicle by using high speed driving or other evasive tactics such as driving off a highway,
turning suddenly, or driving in a legal manner but willfully failing to yield to an officer's signal
to stop.

VEHICLE FOLLOW DEFINED

314.1.2
A vehicle follow is an event involving one or more law enforcement officers attempting to
detain a suspect vehicle that is failing to yield to the visual and/or audio signals of the law
enforcement officers but not operating the vehicle in a reckless manner.

ATTEMPTING TO ELUDE

314.1.3
Refers to the actions of a vehicle operator who after being given a visual or audible signal
to bring the vehicle to a stop, fails or refuses to immediately stop the vehicle and drives in a
reckless manner while attempting to elude a uniformed officer operating a pursuing police
vehicle that is equipped with emergency lights and siren (RCW 46.61.024).

314.2 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES
It shall be the policy of this department that a motor vehicle pursuit shall be conducted
only with emergency lights and siren as required by RCW 46.61.035 for exemption from
compliance with the rules of the road. The following policy is established to provide officers
with guidelines for driving with due regard and caution for the safety of all persons using
the highway as required by RCW 46.61.035(4).

314.2.1 WHEN TO INITIATE A PURSUIT
It is the policy of the Spokane Police Department that pursuits are permissible only when the
necessity for immediate apprehension outweighs the danger created by the pursuit itself.
Officers shall not initiate a pursuit solely for traffic infractions nor property crimes, whether
misdemeanor or felony. Officers may initiate pursuits for the following reasons:

Violent Felony or warrant for same, DV Assault (within mandatory arrest window) DUI,
Reckless Driving of an egregious manner prior to the officer encountering the suspect
vehicle.

While officers may initiate a pursuit for the above listed reasons, officers shall at all times
consider the following factors individually and collectively in deciding whether to initiate or
continue a pursuit:

(a)

(c)

(f)

(i)
(j)

The importance of protecting the public and balancing the known or reasonably
suspected offense and the apparent need for immediate capture against the risks to
officers, innocent motorists and others.

(b) Apparent nature of the fleeing suspect(s) (e.g., whether the suspect(s) represent a

serious threat to public safety).
Safety of the public in the area of the pursuit, including the type of area, time of day,
the amount of vehicular and pedestrian traffic and the speed of the pursuit relative to
these factors.

(d) Pursuing officer(s) familiarity with the area of

the quality of radio
communications between the pursuing units and the dispatcher/supervisor and the
driving capabilities of the pursuing officers under the conditions of the pursuit.
(e) Weather, traffic and road conditions that substantially increase the danger of the

the pursuit,

pursuit beyond the worth of immediately apprehending the suspect.
Performance capabilities of the vehicles used in the pursuit in relation to the speeds
and other conditions of the pursuit.

(g) Vehicle speeds.
(h) Other persons in or on the pursued vehicle (e.g., passengers, co-offenders and

hostages).
Availability of other resources such as helicopter assistance.
The police unit is carrying passengers other than police officers. Pursuits shall not be
undertaken with a prisoner(s) in the police vehicle. Pursuits shall not be initiated or
entered into when a passenger is in the vehicle. Exceptions may be granted by the
Office of the Chief or designee.

As previously stated, pursuits are prohibited when initiated solely for traffic
infractions and property crimes (whether felony or misdemeanor), or based on
the mere fact that the vehicle is fleeing. The decision to initiate a pursuit must be
based on the officer's conclusion that the immediate danger to the public and to
the officer(s) created by the pursuit is less than the immediate or potential danger

pursuits, the initiating officer must be able to clearly articulate the reason(s) why
the pursuit was initiated.

314.2.2 WHEN TO TERMINATE A PURSUIT
Pursuits should be discontinued whenever the totality of objective circumstances known or
which reasonably ought to be known to the officer or supervisor during the pursuit indicates
that the present risks of continuing the pursuit reasonably appear to outweigh the risks
resulting from the suspect(s)' escape.

The factors listed in Policy Manual § 314.2.1 are expressly included herein and will apply
equally to the decision to discontinue as well as the decision to initiate a pursuit. Officers
and supervisors must objectively and continuously weigh the seriousness of the offense
against the potential danger to innocent motorists and themselves when electing to continue
a pursuit.
In the context of this policy, the term "terminate" shall be construed to mean
discontinue or to stop chasing the fleeing vehicle(s).

"Terminate" shall mean all pursuing officers shall pull their vehicle to the side of the
roadway, stop, shut off emergency equipment and notify the Combined Communications
Center of their location. Officers not directly involved as primary or secondary vehicles
shall discontinue following the pursuit.

In addition to the factors listed in Policy Manual § 314.2.1, the following factors should also
be considered in deciding whether to terminate a pursuit:

(a) Distance between the pursuing officers and the fleeing vehicle(s) is so great that
further pursuit would be futile or require the pursuit to continue for an unreasonable
time and/or distance.

(b) Pursued vehicle's location is no longer definitely known.

(c) Officer's pursuit vehicle sustains any type of damage that renders it unsafe to drive.

(d) Extended pursuits of violators for misdemeanors not involving violence or risk of

serious harm (independent of the pursuit) are discouraged.

(e) Hazards to uninvolved bystanders or motorists.

(f)

If the identity of the felony offender is known and it appears that the immediate risks to
the public and officer(s) associated with continuing the pursuit now outweigh the risks
that the felony offender will continue to pose to the public if allowed to temporarily
escape.

(g) Directed by any commissioned supervisor, to include a corporal

SPEED LIMITS

314.2.3
The speed of a pursuit is a factor that should be evaluated on a continuing basis by the
officer and supervisor. Evaluation of vehicle speeds shall take into consideration public
safety, officer safety and the safety of the occupants of the fleeing vehicle. Should high
vehicle speeds be reached during a pursuit, officers and supervisors shall also consider
these factors when determining the reasonableness of the speed of the pursuit:

(a) Pursuit speeds have become unreasonably unsafe for the surrounding conditions.

(b) Pursuit speeds have exceeded the driving ability of the officer.

(c)

Pursuit speeds are beyond the capabilities of the pursuit vehicle thus making its
operation unsafe.

PURSUIT UNITS

314.3
Pursuit units should be limited to two vehicles; However, the number of units involved will
vary with the circumstances. An officer or supervisor may request additional units to join a
pursuit if, after assessing the factors outlined above, it appears that the number of officers
involved would be insufficient to safely arrest the suspect(s). All other officers should stay
out of the pursuit, but should remain alert to its progress and location. Any officer who drops
out of a pursuit may then, if necessary, proceed to the termination point in a safe manner.

AUTHORIZED PURSUIT VEHICLES

314.3.1
The Crown Victoria is currently the only manufacturer certified pursuit vehicle in use by
the Spokane Police Department. Special service vehicles to include sport utility vehicles,
traditional passenger cars, motorcycles and other non-pursuit certified
trucks, vans,
vehicles should not be used in pursuits.

VEHICLES WITHOUT EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT

314.3.2
Vehicles not equipped with emergency lights and siren are generally prohibited from
initiating or joining in any pursuit. Officer(s) in such vehicles, however, may become
involved in emergency activities involving serious crimes or life threatening situations.

Those officers should terminate their involvement in any pursuit immediately upon arrival of
a sufficient number of emergency police vehicles or any police helicopter. The exemptions
provided by RCW 46.61.035 do not apply to officers using vehicles without emergency
equipment.

PRIMARY UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES

314.3.3
The initial pursuing unit will be designated as the primary pursuit unit and will be responsible
for the conduct of the pursuit unless it is unable to remain reasonably close enough to
the violator's vehicle. The primary responsibility of the officer initiating the pursuit is the
apprehension of the suspect(s) without unreasonable danger to themselves or other
persons.

Notify the Combined Communications Center that a vehicle pursuit has been initiated and
as soon as practical provide information including, but not limited to:

(a) Reason for the pursuit.

Location and direction of travel.

Speed of the fleeing vehicle.

(b)

(c)

Vehicle Pursuit Policy

The officer in the primary unit shall be responsible for broadcasting the progress of
the pursuit unless directed otherwise by a supervisor or when practical circumstances
indicate. Whenever possible, the primary unit, if a one-officer unit, should relinquish the
responsibility of broadcasting the progress of the pursuit to a secondary unit or aircraft in
order to concentrate on pursuit driving.

"Progress" shall mean updating speed, location, direction of travel and traffic conditions.

314.3.4
The second officer in the pursuit is responsible for the following:

SECONDARY UNIT(S) RESPONSIBILITIES

(a)

The officer in the secondary unit should immediately notify the dispatcher of entry into
the pursuit.

(b) Remain a safe distance behind the primary unit unless directed to assume the role of

(c)

primary officer, or if the primary unit is unable to continue the pursuit.
The secondary officer should be responsible for broadcasting the progress of the
pursuit unless the situation indicates otherwise.

PURSUIT DRIVING TACTICS

314.3.5
The decision to use specific driving tactics requires the same assessment of considerations
outlined in the factors to be considered concerning pursuit initiation and termination. The
following are tactics for units involved in the pursuit:

(a) Officers, considering their driving skills and vehicle performance capabilities, will
space themselves from other involved vehicles so that they are able to see and avoid
hazards or react safely to maneuvers by the fleeing vehicle.

(b) Because intersections can present increased risks, the following tactics should be

Available units not directly involved in the pursuit may proceed safely to
controlled intersections ahead of the pursuit in an effort to warn cross traffic.
Pursuing units should exercise due caution when proceeding through controlled
intersections.

2.

(c) Officers should not pursue vehicles that proceed the wrong way on a highway,
freeway access or one-way street unless specifically authorized by a

considered:
1.

freeway,
supervisor.

(d) Notifying the Washington State Patrol and/or other jurisdictional agency if it appears

that the pursuit may enter their jurisdiction.

(e) Officers involved in a pursuit should not attempt to pass other units unless the situation

indicates otherwise or requested to do so by the primary unit.

TACTICS/PROCEDURES FOR UNITS NOT INVOLVED IN THE PURSUIT

314.3.6
Other officers in the area of the pursuit shall monitor the progress of the pursuit. They
should not become directly involved in the pursuit unless requested to do so by the primary
or secondary unit or the supervisor. They should be available in case they are needed
to help provide resources that may be needed to terminate the pursuit and assist in the
apprehension of the suspects after the pursuit has been terminated. Paralleling the pursuit
is allowed for the limited purposes of assisting with traffic control or for other public safety
purposes. Officers are authorized to use emergency equipment at intersections along the
pursuit path to clear intersections of vehicular and pedestrian traffic to protect the public.

Vehicle Pursuit Policy

Officers not involved directly in the pursuit, who are needed to assist, will operate their
vehicles utilizing emergency equipment as necessary per RCW 46.61.035 and RCW
46.37.190.

The primary and secondary units should be the only units operating under emergency
conditions (emergency lights and siren) unless other units are assigned to the pursuit.

the availability of air support should be

The supervising sergeant and/or dispatch supervisor will ensure that this option
is considered.

•

•

•

•

If air support is available, officers or supervisors should request assistance.
–

"Available" means currently operating in-flight.

When air support arrives on scene and is able to assume and maintain visual contact
with the fleeing vehicle, SPD pursuing officers will discontinue close pursuit, unless
the tactical needs of the situation clearly call for continuing close pursuit.
The intent of discontinuing close pursuit is to encourage the fleeing vehicle to cease
driving in a reckless manner because the driver believes police pursuit has ended. It
is also recognized that a frequent result of discontinued pursuits is that the suspect
driver stops the vehicle and flees on foot.
When close pursuit is discontinued, units may continue to safely position themselves
strategically to respond in the event that the fleeing vehicle stops and/or the suspect(s)
flee on foot. This repositioning should be outside of the view of the fleeing vehicle and
officers shall use due care and caution when doing so.

SUPERVISORY CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY

314.4
It is the policy of this department that available supervisory and management control will be
exercised over all motor vehicle pursuits involving officers from this department. The field
supervisor of the officer initiating the pursuit, or if unavailable, the nearest field supervisor
(corporal or above) will be responsible for the following:

(a) Upon becoming aware of a pursuit, immediately ascertain all reasonably available
information to continuously assess the situation and risk factors associated with the
pursuit in order to ensure that the pursuit is conducted within established department
guidelines.

(b) Engage in the pursuit, when appropriate, to provide on scene supervision.
(c)
Exercise management and control of the pursuit even if not engaged in it
(d) Ensure that no more than the number of required police units needed are involved in

the pursuit under the guidelines set forth in this policy.

(e) Direct that the pursuit be terminated if, in his/her judgment, it is unjustified to continue

the pursuit under the guidelines of this policy.
Ensure that aircraft are requested if available.
(f)
(g) Ensure that the proper radio channel is being used.
(h) Ensure the notification and/or coordination of outside agencies if the pursuit either

leaves or is likely to leave the jurisdiction of this agency.
Control and manage SPD units when a pursuit enters another jurisdiction.

SHIFT COMMANDER RESPONSIBILITY

314.4.1
Upon becoming aware that a pursuit has been initiated, the Shift Commander should
monitor and continually assess the situation and ensure the pursuit is conducted within
the guidelines and requirements of this policy. The Shift Commander has the final
responsibility for the coordination, control and termination of a motor vehicle pursuit and
shall be in overall command. The Shift Commander shall review all pertinent reports for
content and forward them through the chain of command to the Patrol Commander.

PATROL COMMANDER RESPONSIBILITY

314.4.2
The Patrol Commander shall review all pertinent reports for content. The Patrol Commander
shall be responsible to identify and address any trends that require training or correction
within the Patrol Division. The Patrol Commander shall forward the pursuit reviews to the
Traffic Unit for storage.

COMMUNICATIONS

314.5
If the pursuit is confined within the City limits, radio communications will be conducted on the
primary channel unless instructed otherwise by a supervisor or communications dispatcher.

If the pursuit leaves the jurisdiction of this department, involved units may switch radio
communications, whenever available, to a channel that is most advantageous for effective
radio communications.

314.5.1
COMBINED COMMUNICATIONS CENTER RESPONSIBILITIES
Upon notification that a pursuit has been initiated, the Combined Communications Center
will:

(a) Coordinate pursuit communications of the involved units and personnel.

(b) Notify and coordinate with other involved or affected agencies as practical.

(c)

Ensure that a field supervisor is notified of the pursuit.

(d) Assign an incident number and log all pursuit activities.

(e) Broadcast pursuit updates as well as other pertinent information as necessary.

(f)

Notify the Shift Commander as soon as practical.

INTER-JURISDICTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

314.6
When a pursuit enters another agency's jurisdiction,
the primary officer or supervisor
should determine whether or not to request the other agency to assume the pursuit, taking
into consideration distance traveled, unfamiliarity with the area, and other pertinent facts.
Unless entry into another jurisdiction is expected to be brief, it is generally recommended
that the primary officer or supervisor ensure that notification is provided to each outside
jurisdiction into which the pursuit is reasonably expected to enter, regardless of whether
or not such jurisdiction is expected to assist.

The potential for a pursuit to continue to another jurisdiction should be considered a factor
that could influence the decision of the supervisor or shift commander to terminate the
pursuit.

Vehicle Pursuit Policy

Officers making a felony arrest in another state are responsible to have the defendant taken,
without unnecessary delay, before a magistrate of the county in the state in which the arrest
is made.

ASSUMPTION OF PURSUIT BY ANOTHER AGENCY

314.6.1
Units originally involved will discontinue the pursuit when this agency has requested and the
other agency has advised that it has assumed the pursuit and assistance of the Spokane
Police Department is no longer needed. Upon discontinuing the pursuit, the primary unit
may proceed upon request, and at the direction of a supervisor, to the termination point to
assist in the investigation. The role and responsibilities of officers at the termination of a
pursuit initiated by this department shall be coordinated with appropriate consideration of
the units from the agency assuming the pursuit.

Notification of a pursuit in progress should not be construed as a request to join the pursuit.

Requests to or from another agency to assume a pursuit should be specific.

PURSUITS EXTENDING INTO THIS JURISDICTION

314.6.2
The agency that initiates a pursuit shall be responsible for conducting the pursuit. Units
from this department should not join a pursuit unless specifically requested to do so by the
agency whose officers are in pursuit. The exception to this is when a single unit from the
initiating agency is in pursuit. Under this circumstance, a unit from this department may join
the pursuit until sufficient units from the initiating agency join the pursuit. When a request
is made for this department to assist or take over a pursuit from another agency that has
entered this jurisdiction, the supervisor should consider these additional factors:

(a)

The original reason for the pursuit is compliant with SPD pursuit policy, section
314.2.1.

(b) Ability to maintain the pursuit.

(c)

(d)

Adequate staffing to continue the pursuit.

The public's safety within this jurisdiction.

(e) Safety of the pursuing officers.

As soon as practical, a supervisor or the Shift Commander should review a request for
assistance from another agency. The Shift Commander or supervisor, after consideration
of the above factors, may decline to assist in, or assume the other agency's pursuit.

Assistance to a pursuing allied agency by officers of this department will terminate at the
City limits provided that the pursuing officers have sufficient assistance from other sources.

Ongoing participation from this department should continue until sufficient assistance is
present.

In the event that a pursuit from another agency terminates within this jurisdiction, officers
shall provide appropriate assistance to officers from the allied agency including, but not
limited to, scene control, coordination and completion of supplemental reports and any other
assistance requested or needed.

PURSUIT INTERVENTION/FORCIBLE STOPS

314.7
Forcible stops are an attempt to terminate the ability of a suspect to continue to flee in a
motor vehicle through tactical application of technology, road spikes, blocking, boxing, PIT
(Pursuit Intervention Technique), ramming or roadblock procedures.

314.7.1 WHEN USE AUTHORIZED
In deciding whether to use forcible stops, officers/supervisors should balance the risks of
allowing the pursuit to continue with the potential hazards arising from the use of each tactic
to the public, the officers and persons in or on the pursued vehicle. With these risks in mind,
the decision to use any forcible stop should be reasonable in light of the circumstances
confronting the officer at the time of the decision.

It is imperative that officers act within the bounds of legality, good judgment and accepted
practices

DEFINITIONS

314.7.2
Blocking A slow speed coordinated maneuver where two or more patrol vehicles
simultaneously intercept and block the movement of a momentarily stopped suspect
vehicle, the driver of which may be unaware of the impending enforcement stop, with the
goal of containment and preventing a pursuit. Blocking is not a moving or stationary road
block.

Boxing Technique A tactic designed to stop a violator's vehicle by surrounding it with law
enforcement vehicles and then slowing all vehicles to a stop.

Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT) A maneuver designed to cause the suspect vehicle
to spin out and terminate the pursuit.

Ramming The deliberate act of impacting a violator's vehicle with another vehicle to
functionally damage or otherwise force the violator's vehicle to stop.

Roadblocks A tactic designed to stop a violator's vehicle by intentionally placing an
emergency vehicle or other immovable object in the path of the violator's vehicle.

Spike Strips or Stop Sticks A device that extends across the roadway designed to
puncture the tires of the pursued vehicle.

USE OF FIREARMS

314.7.3
The use of firearms to disable a pursued vehicle is not generally an effective tactic and
involves all the dangers associated with discharging firearms. Officers should not utilize
firearms during an ongoing pursuit unless the conditions and circumstances dictate that
such use reasonably appears necessary to protect life. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to prohibit any officer from using a firearm to stop a suspect from using a vehicle
as a deadly weapon.

INTERVENTION/FORCIBLE STOP STANDARDS

314.7.4
Any intervention/forcible stop tactic, depending upon the conditions and circumstances
under which it is used, may present dangers to the officers, the public, or anyone in or
on the vehicle being pursued. Certain applications of intervention/forcible stop tactics
may be construed to be a use of deadly force and subject to the requirements for such
use. Officers who have not received certified departmental training in the application and
use of any forcible stop or intervention tactic or equipment shall consider these facts and

Vehicle Pursuit Policy

requirements prior to deciding how, when, where, and if an intervention/forcible stop tactic
should be employed.

(a) Blocking should only be considered in cases involving felony suspects or impaired
drivers who pose a threat to public safety when officers reasonably believe that
attempting a conventional enforcement stop will likely result in the driver attempting
to flee in the vehicle. Because of the potential risks involved this technique should
only be employed by officers who have received training in such tactics after giving
consideration to the following:
1.

The need to immediately stop the suspect vehicle or prevent it from leaving
substantially outweighs the risks of injury or death to occupants of the suspect
vehicle, officers, or other members of the public.
All other reasonable intervention techniques have failed or reasonably appear
ineffective.
Employing the blocking maneuver does not unreasonably increase the risk to
officer safety.
The target vehicle is stopped or traveling at a low speed.
At no time should civilian vehicles be used to deploy this technique.

2.

3.

4.
5.

(b) Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT) Only those officers trained and certified in the use
of the Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT) will be authorized to use this procedure.
PIT is authorized to apprehend fleeing offenders when less intrusive measures have
been tried or considered and have been judged to be ineffective.
1.

The officer employing the PIT must balance the necessity of apprehension of
the suspect with the risk of utilizing the technique. PIT executed at 40 MPH or
less is at the discretion of the officer. PIT executed at more than 40 MPH may be
considered only after supervisory approval. The use of a PIT maneuver shall be
reported in the incident report and the pursuit review form. Damage to vehicles
or property as a result of a PIT maneuver shall be investigated as a collision.

(c) Ramming a fleeing vehicle should be done only after other reasonable tactical means
at the officer's disposal have been exhausted. This tactic should be reserved for
situations where there does not appear to be another reasonable and alternative
method. This policy is an administrative guide to direct officers in their decision making

criminal litigation to judge the propriety of the act½¾ that is a matter for the courts
to determine by established law. When ramming is to be employed as a means with
which to stop a fleeing vehicle, one or more of the following factors should be present:
is an actual or suspected felon who reasonably appears to

The suspect
represent a serious threat to society if not apprehended.
The suspect is driving in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons½¾
or, driving in a reckless and life endangering manner.
If there does not reasonably appear to be a present or immediately foreseeable
serious threat to the public, the use of ramming is not authorized.

3.

2.

(d) Boxing Technique: Pursuing officers should obtain supervisor approval before
attempting to box a suspect vehicle during a pursuit. The use of such a technique
must be carefully coordinated with all involved units, taking into consideration the
circumstances and conditions presented at the time as well as the potential risk of
injury to officers, the public and occupants of the pursued vehicle.
If the pursued
vehicle is a motorcycle, a vehicle transporting hazardous materials, or a school

bus transporting children, then officers and supervisors should weigh the potential
consequences against the need to immediately stop the vehicle.

(e) Spike strips should be deployed only when the involved officers are reasonably certain
that only the pursued vehicle will be affected by their use. Officers should carefully
consider the limitations of such devices as well as the potential risks to officers, the
public and occupants of the pursued vehicle.

(f)

Because roadblocks involve a potential for serious injury or death to occupants of the
pursued vehicle if the suspect does not stop, the intentional placement of roadblocks
in the direct path of a pursued vehicle is discouraged and should not be deployed
without prior approval of a supervisor and only then under extraordinary conditions
when all other reasonable intervention techniques have failed or reasonably appear
ineffective and the need to immediately stop the pursued vehicle substantially
outweighs the risks of injury or death to occupants of the pursued vehicle, officers or
other members of the public.
If a roadblock is approved, there must be an escape
route left for the pursued vehicle to use.

judgment are the keys to a successful
Proper self-discipline and sound professional
conclusion of a pursuit and apprehension of evading suspects. Officers shall use only
that amount of force, which reasonably appears necessary under the circumstances, to
properly perform their lawful duties.

Unless relieved by a supervisor, the primary officer should coordinate efforts to apprehend
the suspect(s) following the pursuit. Officers should consider safety of the public and the
involved officers when formulating plans to contain and capture the suspect.

314.8
The following reports should be completed:

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

(a) Officers shall complete appropriate crime/arrest reports. The primary officer shall

complete a report, which shall minimally contain the following information.

1. Whether any person involved in the pursuit or subsequent arrest was injured,

the safe and appropriate response to emergency and

RESPONSE TO CALLS

316.2
Calls for service are prioritized by the Combined Communications Center (see policy § 802).
Officers dispatched to Priority 1 or Priority 2 calls shall consider the call an emergency
response and proceed immediately. Officers responding to these emergency calls may
determine that it is appropriate to utilize emergency equipment in order to facilitate a safe,
efficient response. When operating "Code 3" (with emergency equipment engaged), officers
shall continuously operate emergency lighting equipment, including at minimum a steady
forward facing emergency lights, and shall sound the siren as reasonably necessary (RCW
46.61.035).

Responding with emergency light(s) and siren does not relieve the officer of the duty to
continue to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons. The use of any other warning
equipment without emergency lights and siren does not provide any exemption from the
RCW.

Any Priority 3, 4 or 5 call is a routine call. Officers are not authorized to respond Code-3 for
routine calls. Officers responding to routine calls shall observe all traffic laws and proceed
without the use of emergency lights and siren.

316.3
REQUESTING NON-EMERGENCY AND EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE
Under normal circumstances, officers will request non-emergency assistance in plain
speech. Officers should specify the number of backup officers needed.

Code 4: Where a situation has stabilized and emergency response is no longer required,
the requesting officer shall immediately notify the Combined Communications Center that
no further backup is required.

Code 6: When an officer needs immediate assistance due to a quickly developing,
potentially dangerous situation.

Code 13: When an officer requires a back-up, but not emergency, assistance. Officers
responding to a Code 13 will respond immediately and by the most direct route, but without
utilizing emergency equipment and in compliance with all traffic laws.

Code 98: When an officer is unable to make a voice transmission, she/he may utilize the
panic button on either the patrol vehicle MDC or portable radio.

Code 99: When an officer is involved in a situation that is an immediate threat to the safety
of officers, or assistance is needed to prevent imminent serious harm to a citizen.

Officers responding to a Code 6, Code 99 or Code 98 should respond Code 3 (emergency
lights and siren).

INITIATING CODE 3 RESPONSE

316.4
If an officer believes a Code-3 response to any call is appropriate, the officer shall engage
emergency equipment and proceed to the call. Officers who respond should reasonably
assess factors such as:

(a) Distance from the call.

(b) Relative exigency of the call.

(c) Weather and geographical conditions.

(d)

Traffic.

(e) Officer's driving experience and ability.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF RESPONDING OFFICER(S)

316.5
Officers shall exercise sound judgment and care with due regard for life and property when
responding to an emergency call. Officers shall reduce speed at all street intersections to
such a degree that they shall have complete control of the vehicle.

The decision to continue a Code-3 response is at the discretion of the officer.
If, in the
officer's judgment, the roadway conditions or traffic congestion does not permit such a
response without unreasonable risk, the officer may elect to respond to the call without the
use of emergency lights and siren at the legal speed limit. An officer shall also discontinue
the Code-3 response when directed by a supervisor.

Upon receiving a Priority 1 or Priority 2 call, an officer shall immediately give the location
from which he/she is responding.

COMMUNICATIONS RESPONSIBILITIES

316.6
A dispatcher shall dispatch Priority 1 and 2 calls via voice transmission. The dispatcher
shall utilize the alert tone when appropriate under Communications Policy. The dispatcher
shall:

(a) Attempt to assign the closest available unit to the location requiring assistance.

(b) Notify and coordinate allied emergency services (e.g., fire and ambulance).

(c) Continue to obtain and broadcast information as necessary concerning the response

and monitor the situation until it is stabilized or terminated.

(d) Control all radio communications during the emergency and coordinate assistance
under the direction of the Shift Commander, field supervisor and communications

The field supervisor should monitor the response to Priority 1 and 2 calls, as practical, until
the situation has been stabilized or terminated. If necessary, the field supervisor may assert
control by directing units into or out of the response. If, in the supervisor's judgment, the
circumstances require additional units to be assigned a Code-3 response, the supervisor
may do so.

It is the supervisor's responsibility to terminate a Code-3 response that, in his/her judgment
is inappropriate due to the circumstances.

When making the decision as to the appropriateness of a Code-3 response, the Shift

Canine Program

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

318.1
The Canine Program was established to augment police services to the community. Highly
skilled and trained teams of handlers and canines have evolved from the program and are
used to supplement police operations to locate individuals, contraband and to apprehend
criminal offenders.

318.2 GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF CANINES
A canine may be used to locate and apprehend a suspect if the canine handler reasonably
believes the individual has either committed or threatened to commit any criminal offense
and if any of the following conditions exist:

There is a reasonable belief the individual poses an imminent threat of violence or
serious harm to the public, any officer, or the handler.

The individual is physically resisting arrest and the use of a canine reasonably appears
to be necessary to overcome such resistance.

The individual(s) is/are believed to be concealed in an area where entry by other than
the canine would pose a threat to the safety of officers or the public.

It is recognized that situations may arise that do not fall within the provisions set forth in this
policy. In any such case, a standard of objective reasonableness shall be used to review
the decision to use a canine in view of the totality of the circumstances.

Mere flight from pursuing officer(s) shall not serve as good cause for the use of a canine to
apprehend an individual.

PREPARATIONS FOR UTILIZING A CANINE

318.2.1
Prior to the use of a canine to search for or apprehend any individual, the canine handler
and/or the supervisor on scene shall carefully consider all pertinent information reasonably
available at the time. The information should include, but is not limited to the following:

The individual's age or estimate thereof.

The nature of the suspected offense.

Any potential danger to the public and/or other officers at the scene if the canine is
released.

The degree of resistance the subject has shown.

The potential for escape or flight if the police canine is not utilized.

The potential for injury to officers or the public caused by the suspect if the police
canine is not utilized.

As circumstances permit,
communicate and coordinate with other involved personnel
unintended injury.

the canine handler should make every reasonable effort to
to minimize the risk of

Generally, a canine handler has the authority to deploy or not to deploy the canine. The
handler will evaluate each situation and determine if the use of a canine is technically

feasible. A supervisor sufficiently apprised of the situation may override the decision of
the canine handler and shall assume the responsibility associated with that.

318.2.2 WARNINGS GIVEN TO ANNOUNCE THE USE OF A CANINE
Unless it would otherwise increase the risk of injury or escape, a clearly audible warning
to announce that a canine will be released if the person does not come forth, shall be
made prior to releasing a canine. The canine handler, when practical, shall first advise the
supervisor of his/her decision if a verbal warning is not given prior to releasing the canine.
In the event of an apprehension, the handler shall document in any related report whether
or not a verbal warning was given and, if none was given, the reasons why.

USE OF NARCOTIC-DETECTION CANINES

318.2.3
A narcotic-detection-trained canine may be used in accordance with current law under the
following circumstances:

(a)
(b)
(c)

To assist in the search for narcotics during a search warrant service.
To obtain a search warrant by using the detection canine in support of probable cause.
To search vehicles, buildings, bags, and any other articles or areas deemed
necessary.

(d) Absent a warrant, a narcotic-detection canine will not be used to search a person for

narcotics.

USE OF BOMB/EXPLOSIVE DETECTION DOGS

318.2.4
Because of the high risk of danger to the public and officers when a bomb or other explosive
device is suspected, the use of a trained explosive detection dog team may be warranted.
When available, a trained explosive detection dog team may be used in accordance with
current law and under the following circumstances:
(a)

To assist in the search of a building, structure, area, vehicle or article where an actual
or suspected explosive device has been reported or located.
To conduct preventative searches at locations such as special events, VIP visits,
official buildings and other restricted areas. Because a dog sniff may be considered
a search, such searches of individuals should remain minimally intrusive and shall be
strictly limited to the purpose of detecting explosives.
To assist with searches at transportation facilities and vehicles (e.g., buses, airplanes
and trains).
To assist in the search of scenes where an explosion has occurred and an explosive
device or secondary explosive device is suspected.

(b)

(d)

(c)

(e) At no time will a detection dog be used to render a suspected device safe or clear.

GUIDELINES FOR NON-APPREHENSION USE

318.2.5
Because police canines have senses far superior to those of humans, they may often be
effectively utilized to track or search for non-criminals (e.g., lost children, individuals who
may be disoriented or in need of medical attention) or suspects wanted for minor criminal

conditions and the ability of the canine to determine the feasibility of such an application.

Patrol canines will only be used in community care-taking situations when it has been
established that the risk of death or serious injury outweighs the risk of any injury that may
be accidentally inflicted by the canine. Handlers will make a supervisor fully aware of the

situation and receive explicit permission from the supervisor prior to deploying the canine
in all such situations, unless immediate action by the handler is required. During these
searches, the handler will take great precaution to avoid unintentional canine contact,
always keeping the canine leashed.

REPORTING CANINE USE, BITES AND INJURIES

318.2.6
Whenever the canine is deployed, documentation shall be completed by the handler and
turned in to the canine supervisor.

If a bite or injury results from the use of the canine, that information shall be documented
on a Canine Contact Report form and included in the case narrative/supplemental report
and forwarded through the chain of command. The report should include, at a minimum,
the following:

In all cases of bites or injury resulting from the use of a canine, photographs shall
be taken of the bite or injury after first tending to the immediate needs of the injured
party.
If the injury requires medical attention, the subject should be transported to
an appropriate medical facility. In the event an in-custody suspect requires medical
attention, an officer should standby with the suspect until
treatment has been
rendered.

(b) Whenever a bite results, the canine supervisor shall notify the County Health Office

as soon after the incident as practical.

If a subject alleges an injury that is not visible, notification shall be made to a
supervisor and the location of the alleged injury should be photographed.

If an unintentional bite has taken place, the canine supervisor will then contact the
person(s) that were injured and take a statement as soon as possible. The duty staff
officer will also be notified and on-call risk manager will be notified.

If injuries are sustained by a City employee or volunteer, a supervisor will be notified
and the supervisor will assure that all appropriate reports, to include L & I Injury Report,
are completed.

(a)

(c)

(d)

(e)

REPORTING CANINE INJURIES

318.2.7
In the event that a canine is injured, the injury will be immediately reported to the canine
sergeant or to the on-duty shift commander in his/her absence.

Depending on the severity of the injury, the canine shall either be treated by the designated
veterinarian or transported to a designated emergency medical facility for treatment. If the
handler and dog are out of the area, the handler may use the nearest available veterinarian.

The injury will be documented by the canine sergeant.

ASSIGNMENT OF CANINES

318.2.8
The canine teams shall be assigned to the Operations Bureau to supplement and assist the
Operations Bureau.

Canine teams should function primarily as cover units however; they may be assigned by
the Shift Commander to other functions based on the shift needs at the time.

Generally, canine teams should not be assigned to handle matters that will take them out of
service for extended periods of time unless absolutely necessary and only with the approval
of the Shift Commander.

The Chief of Police or his/her designee may provide controlled substances for training
purposes under the following conditions:

(a)

To any duly authorized peace officer assigned to the canine unit.

(b) Provided the controlled substances are no longer needed as criminal evidence.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

319.1
It is the policy of the Spokane Police Department that persons not directly involved in an
incident may be allowed to remain in proximity of any stop, detention, or arrest, or any
other incident occurring in a public place. Allowing persons to remain in proximity to these
policing actions is contingent that their presence is lawful and their activities, including their
verbal comments, do not obstruct, hinder, delay or threaten the safety of anyone present,
including the officers.

No person present should be allowed to compromise the outcome of legitimate police
actions and/or rescue efforts.

POLICE ACTIONS

it

(b) Officer safety, the protection of the suspect or person(s) being detained, including
his/her right to privacy, as well as the safety of onlookers are all important factors to
consider. With these factors in mind, officers shall recognize and obey the right of
persons to observe, photograph, and/or make verbal comments in the presence of
police officers performing their duty.

(c) Citizens, regardless of their intent to video and/or audio record a police activity, shall
not enter any established, well marked and protected crime scene. This applies as
well to any restricted area that would normally be unavailable to the general public.
At any secure scene, officers or detectives will determine who enters or leaves the
secured area.

In public areas, there is not a distinction between citizens employed by a news media
organization and those who are not. Under most circumstances, the existence of
"press credentials" extends no special privileges to any citizen, nor does the absence
of such credentials limit a citizen's free access to record law enforcement activities
while in public.

BYSTANDER FILMING OF OFFICER-SUSPECT CONTACTS

It is increasingly common for those near any police action and who are not directly
involved in any criminal activity, to record contacts between officers and citizens.

319.4 OBTAINING EVIDENCE OF RECORDED MEDIA

(a)

Interviews or contacts with citizens to obtain their identification, as well as accurate
and complete evidence are encouraged. Officers shall not demand identification,
detain citizens, or seize their recorded media when that media contains video, still
images or sounds associated with any police action or crime being investigated.

(b) When recorded media of any kind is being sought from an uninvolved citizen, the first
course of action in securing this evidence should be a request for voluntary surrender
of the recorded media. Officers making this request and the citizen's response will
be documented in the officer's report. If the citizen voluntarily surrenders the media,
they will be given the Incident number and the requesting officer's name.

(c) When officers do not have sufficient authority to seize any recorded media, but
believe it may be of value in an investigation, officers should attempt to obtain their
identification and advise the citizen that the recorded media may be evidence of
a crime, that a court order will be sought for the media, and that it should not be
tampered with, altered or destroyed. This information will be documented in the
officer's report.

320.2 OFFICER SAFETY
The investigation of domestic violence cases places officers in emotionally charged and

supersede the responsibility of all officers to exercise reasonable care for the safety of any
officers, public and parties involved.

OFFICER PROTECTION FROM LIABILITY

320.2.1
No officer may be held criminally or civilly liable for making a domestic violence arrest
if the officer acts in good faith and without malice (RCW 26.50.140, 10.31.100 (12), and
10.99.070). Officers who willfully fail to enforce the law are not immune from liability, the
above statutes notwithstanding. Victims of domestic violence must receive equal protection
under the law and it is the policy of the Spokane Police Department that all officers will be
held accountable for any willful failure to enforce domestic violence laws.

ENFORCEMENT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

320.3
In its response to domestic violence all employees of the Spokane Police Department
should consistently stress the enforcement of the laws in order protect the victim and
communicate that criminal behavior will not be tolerated. When determining whether a
mandatory arrest is required by law, officers should be aware that the following factors do
not prevent the arrest:

(a) Marital status of suspect and victim.

(b) Whether or not the suspect lives on the premises with the victim.

(c) Claims by the suspect that the victim provoked or perpetuated the violence.

(d) Potential financial consequences of arrest.

The physical or mental health of either party.

Use of drugs or alcohol by either party.

(g) Denial that the abuse occurred where evidence indicates otherwise.

Speculation that complainant may not follow through with the prosecution.

The racial, cultural, social, professional position or sexual orientation of the victim or
suspect.

For domestic violence involving law enforcement employees, see Policy Manual § 1052.

320.3.1 MANDATORY ARRESTS
Officers who respond to an incident of domestic disturbance shall arrest and take into
custody, pending release on bail, personal recognizance, or court order, a person without
a warrant when the officer has probable cause to believe that:

(a) An order has been issued of which the person has knowledge under RCW 26.44.063,
or Chapter 7.90, 10.99, 26.09, 26.10, 26.26, 26.50, or 74.34 restraining the person
and the person has violated the terms of the order restraining the person from acts or
threats of violence, or restraining the person from going onto the grounds of or entering
a residence, workplace, school, or day care, or prohibiting the person from knowingly
coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location or, in
the case of an order issued under RCW 26.44.063, imposing any other restrictions or
conditions upon the person.

(b) A foreign protection order has been issued of which the person under restraint
has knowledge and the person under restraint has violated a provision of
the
foreign protection order prohibiting the person under restraint from contacting or
communicating with another person, or excluding the person under restraint from a
residence, workplace, school, or day care, or prohibiting the person from knowingly
coming within, or knowingly remaining within, a specified distance of a location, or a
violation of any provision for which the foreign protection order specifically indicates
that a violation will be a crime.

(c)

The person is sixteen years or older and within the preceding four hours has assaulted
a family or household member and the officer believes (RCW 10.31.100 (2)):

A felonious assault has occurred.

1.

2.

An assault has occurred which has resulted in bodily injury to the victim, whether
the injury is observable by the responding officer or not.

That any physical action has occurred which was intended to cause another
person reasonably to fear imminent serious bodily injury or death. Bodily injury
means physical pain, illness, or an impairment of physical condition.

DUAL ARRESTS

320.3.2
In responding to domestic violence incidents, officers should generally be reluctant to
make dual arrests. Officers shall make reasonable efforts to identify the primary physical
aggressor in any incident. The primary physical aggressor is the person determined to
be the most significant, and not necessarily the first aggressor. In identifying the primary
physical aggressor, an officer shall make reasonable effort to consider the following (RCW
10.31.100(2)(c)):
(a)

The intent of the law, which is to protect victims of domestic violence from continuing
abuse.
The comparative extent of injuries inflicted or serious threats creating fear of physical
injury.
The history of domestic violence of each person involved, including whether the
conduct was part of an ongoing pattern of abuse.

(b)

(c)

RELEASE

320.3.3
Once a suspect has been arrested under the provisions of RCW 10.31.100(2) the suspect
shall be taken to jail. Officers have no authority to subsequently release the arrested
person and any post incarceration release decision will be the responsibility of corrections
personnel.

VICTIM'S RIGHTS

320.3.4
The officer shall notify the victim of the their right to initiate a criminal proceeding in all cases
where the officer has not exercised arrest powers or decided to initiate criminal proceedings
by citation or otherwise. The parties in such cases shall also be advised of the importance
of preserving evidence (RCW 10.99.030(6)(a)). Issuance of a Crime Victims Rights Card
will satisfy these requirements.

PROTECTIVE ORDER VIOLATIONS

320.3.5
A willful violation of a no-contact provision of a court order is a criminal offense and shall be
enforced accordingly to preserve the integrity and intent of the domestic violence act (RCW
26.50.110 (1)). An officer shall arrest without a warrant and take into custody a person
whom the officer has probable cause to believe has violated a valid protective order (RCW
chapter 7.90, 9.94A, 10.99, 26.09, 26.10, 26.26, or 74.34), or a valid foreign protection order
that restrains the person or excludes the person from a residence, workplace, school, or day
care, or prohibits the person from knowingly coming within, or knowingly remaining within,
a specified distance of a location, if the person restrained knows of the order. Presence of
the order in the law enforcement computer-based criminal intelligence information system
is not the only means of establishing knowledge of the order (RCW 26.50.110 (2)(2)).

320.3.6

TENANCY ISSUES

(a)

If there is no court order in effect, officers may request a person who is not in lawful
possession of the premises to leave when:
1.

The complainant is in lawful possession of the premise (as exhibited by rent
receipts, lease, deed, verification by apartment manager, etc.); and
The complainant has requested that the person leave the premises.

Such civil standbys should be limited to no more than 20 minutes.

If the suspect does not leave upon request, an arrest may be made for trespass.
If the complainant requesting removal of the suspect cannot show proof of lawful
possession, the officer should refer the complainant for a Protection Order or other
appropriate civil remedy.

COURT PROTECTIVE ORDERS

320.4
There are three different types of court orders that can be issued by a court in domestic
violence situations. They are intended as legal measures to prevent further acts of violence,
contact threats or harassment. The three types of orders are:

Orders of Protection must be personally served on the respondent by law
enforcement or a process server; unless the court has ordered service by
publication. The plaintiff cannot serve the respondent.

A restraining order is served on the respondent or the respondent's attorney.
Usually this is part of a civil process, e.g., divorce.

(a) Orders of Protection.

(b) Civil Restraining Order.

(c) Criminal Court Orders.

A criminal No-Contact order is served on the defendant upon release from
jail, at arraignment or sentencing. This department maintains a complete and
systematic record of all outstanding court orders and proof of service (RCW
26.50.100(1)).

RETURN OF SERVICE

320.4.1
Whenever a member of this department serves or assists in serving a court order and that
service is completed, a Return of Service form shall be completed and submitted to the
Washington Crime Information Center (WACIC). Such forms shall include:

(a) Who was served.

(b) What documents were served.

(c) Court order name and number.

(d) Date and time of service.

(e) Address where service occurred.

(f)

Serving officers' names, signatures and personnel numbers.

320.4.2

VERIFICATION OF RESTRAINING ORDERS

(a) When officers respond to alleged violations of court orders, it is necessary to verify
the court order and its service through the Combined Communications Center prior to
taking any enforcement action. All restraining orders issued in Washington are facially
valid statewide. The court orders can be verified by:

1.

A proof of service attached to the plaintiff's copy of the order, showing service
on the respondent - no further verification is required.

(a) No proof of service is required for No-Contact orders as the respondent's

presence is required at the time of issue.

(b)

If
the order has been served, but neither the complainant nor the
respondent has a copy reflecting the terms of the order, request that
dispatch check the terms.

(b)

If the order is not verifiable:

The order shall not be enforced and the complainant should be advised to
contact the court that issued the order, or the attorney who drafted the order.

Arrest the suspect if probable cause exists that a separate crime has been
committed.

VALID FOREIGN (OUT OF STATE) ORDERS FOR PROTECTION WILL

320.4.3
BE ENFORCED
Officers of the Spokane Police Department will enforce valid Foreign Orders for Protection
as if these orders were issued in Washington State. Prior to taking enforcement action,
officers must verify that the Foreign Order for Protection is valid and that the respondent
has been served. There is a presumption in favor of validity where a foreign order appears
authentic on its face. This does not stop an officer from taking action to investigate domestic
violence incidents (e.g., stalking, harassment) which may be taking place in Washington
State.

(a) Disputes regarding provisions in out-of-state protection orders dealing with custody of
children, residential placement of children or visitation with children will be resolved
judicially. Officers will not remove a child from his/her current placement unless:

A writ of habeas corpus to produce the child has been issued by a superior court
of Washington State; or

There is probable cause to believe that the child is at risk of being abused or
neglected and the child would be injured or could not be taken into custody if it
were necessary to first obtain a court order.

EVIDENCE

320.5
The following guidelines should be considered by officers investigating domestic violence
cases:

PHOTOGRAPHS OF INJURIES

320.5.1
The investigating officer should have photographs taken of the victim's injuries. The
victim should be referred to the Spokane Regional Domestic Violence Team for additional
information. If there is a need for any follow-up photographs, the victim should call 911 and
request a corporal respond to take photographs. However, for follow-up photographs of
injuries that are in intimate areas, the victim shall be photographed by a same sex officer
or corporal or be referred to the Spokane County Sheriff's Office Forensic Unit.

Policy Manual

Domestic Violence

Officers should request that the victim complete and sign an authorization for release of
medical records.

OTHER EVIDENCE

320.5.2
All injuries, whether observable or not, should be documented in the incident report. The
emotional demeanor of the victim and suspect should be noted.

Officers should impound all appropriate physical evidence that substantiates the victim's
injuries and/or the crimes charged (e.g., weapons, torn clothing, and broken items).

In cases of serious assaults, officers should attempt to preserve the 9-1-1 tape of the call
for assistance, particularly when the victim is the calling party.

Victims with injuries which may require medical attention at present or in the future, will be
asked by the investigating officer to sign the Authorization for Release of Information form
regarding medical records.

VICTIM ASSISTANCE

320.6
During the course of investigating and reporting domestic violence cases, an officer may
assist a victim in many ways. Some suggested methods of assistance are:

(a) Assist in obtaining appropriate medical attention if a complainant claims injury,

whether visible or not.

(b) Assist in arranging to transport the victim to an alternate shelter if the victim expresses

a concern for their safety, or the officer determines a need exists.

(c)

Stand by for a reasonable amount of time when a complainant requests police
assistance while removing essential items of personal property.

320.6.1 WRITTEN NOTICE TO VICTIMS
In all cases when an officer responds to a domestic violence call, the officer shall advise
victims of all reasonable means to prevent further abuse, including advising each person
of the availability of a shelter or other services in the community, and giving each person
immediate notice of the legal rights and remedies available. The notice shall
include
handing each person a copy of the following statement (RCW 10.99.030(7)):

"IF YOU ARE THE VICTIM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, you can ask the city or County
Prosecutor to file a criminal complaint. You also have the right to file a petition in
superior, district, or municipal court requesting an order for protection from domestic
abuse which could include any of the following: (a) An order restraining your abuser
from further acts of abuse; (b) an order directing your abuser to leave your household;
(c) an order preventing your abuser from entering your residence, school, business,
or place of employment; (d) an order awarding you or the other parent custody of or
visitation with your minor child or children; and (e) an order restraining your abuser
from molesting or interfering with minor children in your custody. The forms you need
to obtain a protection order are available in any municipal, district, or superior court.
Information about shelters and alternatives to domestic violence is available from a
statewide twenty-four-hour toll-free hot line at (include appropriate phone number).

landlord/tenant dispute) he/she will notify the Combined Communications Center to change
the call's type code in CAD (Computer Aided Dispatch System).

Victims will be asked to provide a written statement on the victim/witness statement form to
include signing it. He/she will be asked to sign the Authorization For Release of Information
form regarding medical records.

Reporting officers should provide the victim with the case number of the report. The case
number may be placed in the space provided on the domestic violence pamphlet provided

Search & Seizure

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

322.1
Case law regarding search and seizure is ever changing and frequently subject
to
interpretation under the varying facts of each situation. This policy is intended to provide
a few of the basic guidelines that may assist an officer in evaluating search and seizure
issues. Specific situations should be handled according to current training and an officer's
familiarity with clearly established case law.

REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY

322.2
Both the United States and the Washington Constitutions provide every individual with the
right to be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion. As a general rule, members of
this department should not physically enter any area where an individual has a reasonable
expectation of privacy in order to conduct a search or seizure without one or more of the
following:

•

•

•

•

•

A valid search warrant

An arrest warrant

Exigent circumstances

Valid consent

Incident to arrest

Always be mindful of the specific terms of the warrant or consent. Also, probable cause
alone is never justification to search a person, place or vehicle.

322.2.1

SEARCH PROTOCOL

(a) Members of this department will conduct person searches with dignity and courtesy.

(b) Members of this department will conduct property searches in a manner that returns
the condition of the property to its pre-search status as nearly as reasonably practical.

(c) Members of this department should attempt to gain keys to locked property when a
search is anticipated and the time and effort required to gain the keys makes it a
practical option.

(d) When the person to be searched is of the opposite sex of the officer, an officer of the

like sex should, if practical, conduct the search.

(e) A search may be undertaken of a member of the opposite sex when it is not practical
In these instances the officers will adhere to the

to use an officer of the like sex.
following guidelines:

1.

2.

A supervisor and/or one other officer should witness the search, if practical.

Officers will use the back side of their hands and fingers to search sensitive
areas of the opposite sex to include the breast, crotch and buttocks areas.

(f)

The officer should explain to the person being searched the reason for the search and
how the officer will conduct the search.

SPECIFIC SITUATIONS

RESIDENCE

322.3.1
Absent a valid search warrant, arrest warrant, exigent circumstances, probation or parole
authorization, or valid consent, every person has a reasonable expectation of privacy
inside his/her home. Individuals do not, however, generally have a reasonable expectation
of privacy in areas around their home where the general public (e.g., mail carriers and
solicitors) would reasonably be permitted to go.

PLAIN VIEW

322.3.2
Because an individual does not have an expectation of privacy as to items that are in plain
view, no search has taken place in a constitutional sense when an object is viewed from a
location where the officer has a right to be.

An item in plain view may generally be seized when all of the following conditions exist:

(a)
(b)
(c)

It was viewed from a lawful location.
There is probable cause to believe that the item is linked to criminal activity.
The location of the item can be legally accessed.

It is important to note that the so-called "Nexus Rule" requires that even items in plain view
must not be seized unless there is probable cause to believe that the item will aid in an
investigation. Such a nexus should be included in any related reports.

EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES

322.3.3
Exigent circumstances permitting entry into premises without a warrant or valid consent
generally include any of the following:

Imminent danger of injury or death

(a)
(b) Serious damage to property
(c)
(d)

Imminent escape of a suspect
The destruction of evidence

An exigency created by the officer's own conduct as an excuse for a warrantless entry is
not generally permitted.

CONSENT

322.4
Entry into a location for the purpose of conducting a search for any item reasonably believed
relevant to any investigation is permitted once valid consent has been obtained. A search
by consent however is only valid if the following criteria are met:

•
•
•

Voluntary (i.e., clear, specific, and unequivocal)
Obtained from a person with authority to give the consent
Does not exceed the scope of the consent given

Prior to conducting a consensual search officers shall inform all persons giving consent of
the following, and shall describe such circumstances in the related report(s):

The person may refuse to give consent if they so choose.

Juvenile non-offender - An abused, neglected, dependent or alien juvenile who may be
legally held for his/her own safety or welfare. This also includes any juvenile who may have
initially been contacted for an offense that would not subject an adult to arrest (e.g., fine-only
offense) but was taken into custody for his/her protection or for purposes of reuniting the
juvenile with a parent, guardian or other responsible person.

Juvenile offender - A juvenile 17 years of age or younger who is alleged to have committed

is completed.

CUSTODY OF JUVENILE STATUS OFFENDERS

324.4.2
Status offenders should generally be released by citation or with a warning rather than taken
into temporary custody. However, officers may take custody of a status offender if requested
to do so by a parent or legal guardian in order to facilitate reunification (e.g., transported
home or to the station to await a parent). Juvenile status offenders may not be held in
secure custody (42 USC § 5633).

CUSTODY OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS

(RCW 13.40.040(1)):

(b) Without a court order, by an officer if grounds exist for the arrest of an adult in identical

Members and supervisors assigned to monitor or process any juvenile at the Spokane
Police Department shall ensure the following:

(a)

The Shift Commander should be notified if it is anticipated that a juvenile may need
to remain at the Spokane Police Department more than four hours. This will enable
the Shift Commander to ensure no juvenile is held at the Spokane Police Department
more than six hours.

(b) A staff member of the same sex shall supervise personal hygiene activities and care,
such as changing clothing or using the restroom, without direct observation to allow
for privacy.

Personal visual checks and significant incidents/activities shall be noted on the log.

There shall be no viewing devices, such as peep holes or mirrors, of which the juvenile
is not aware. Therefore, an employee should inform a juvenile under his/her care that
the juvenile will be monitored at all times, unless he/she is using the toilet. This does
not apply to surreptitious and legally obtained recorded interrogations.

Juveniles shall have reasonable access to toilets and wash basins.

Food should be provided if a juvenile has not eaten within the past four hours or is
otherwise in need of nourishment, including any special diet required for the health of
the juvenile.

security or enabling escape.

Juveniles shall have adequate furnishings, including suitable chairs or benches.

custody.

(o) No discipline may be administered to any juvenile, nor may juveniles be subjected to

corporal or unusual punishment, humiliation or mental abuse.

324.9 USE OF RESTRAINT DEVICES
Juvenile offenders may be handcuffed in accordance with the Handcuffing and Restraints
Policy. A juvenile offender may be handcuffed at the Spokane Police Department when the
juvenile presents a heightened risk. However, non-offenders and status offenders should
not be handcuffed unless they are combative or threatening.

Other restraints shall only be used after less restrictive measures have failed and with the
approval of the Shift Commander. Restraints shall only be used so long as it reasonably
appears necessary for the juvenile's protection or the protection of others.

Temporary Custody of Juveniles

Juveniles in restraints shall be kept away from other unrestrained juveniles or monitored in
such a way as to protect the juvenile from abuse.

PERSONAL PROPERTY

324.10
The officer taking custody of a juvenile offender or status offender at the Spokane Police
Department shall ensure a thorough search of the juvenile's property is made and all
property is removed from the juvenile, especially those items that could compromise
safety, such as pens, pencils and belts.

The personal property of a juvenile should be placed in a property bag. The property should
be kept in a monitored or secure location until the juvenile is released from the custody of
the Spokane Police Department.

SECURE CUSTODY

324.11
Only juvenile offenders 14 years and older may be placed in secure custody. Shift
Commander approval is required before placing a juvenile offender in secure custody.

that the juvenile is a serious risk of harm to him/herself or others.

Members of
non-secure custody is, or later becomes, a reasonable option.

this department should not use secure custody for convenience when

When practicable, handcuffing one hand of a juvenile offender to a fixed object while
otherwise maintaining the juvenile in non-secure custody should be considered as the
method of secure custody, rather than the use of a locked enclosure. An employee must
be present at all times to ensure the juvenile's safety while secured to a stationary object.

Generally, juveniles should not be secured to a stationary object for more than 60 minutes.
Supervisor approval is required to secure a juvenile to a stationary object for longer than
60 minutes and every 30 minutes thereafter. Supervisor approval should be documented.

LOCKED ENCLOSURES

324.11.1
A thorough inspection of the area shall be conducted before placing a juvenile into the
enclosure. A second inspection shall be conducted after removing the juvenile. Any
damage noted to the room should be photographed and documented in the crime report.

The following requirements shall apply to a juvenile offender who is held inside a locked
enclosure:

The juvenile shall constantly be monitored by an audio/video system during the entire
custody.

Juveniles shall have constant auditory access to department members.

Initial placement into and removal from a locked enclosure shall be logged.

(d) Random personal visual checks of the juvenile by staff member, no less than every

15 minutes, shall occur.

All checks shall be logged.

The check should involve questioning the juvenile as to his/her well-being
(sleeping juveniles or apparently sleeping juveniles should be awakened).

Requests or concerns of the juvenile should be logged.

Abuse of Vulnerable Adults

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

326.1
The purpose of this policy is to provide members of this department with direction and
understanding of their role in the prevention, detection, and intervention in incidents of
vulnerable adult abuse. It is the policy of the Spokane Police Department to treat reports of
violence or other exploitation against vulnerable adults as high priority criminal activity that
is to be fully investigated regardless of the relationship between the victim and suspect(s).

326.2
For purposes of this policy, the following definitions are provided (RCW 74.34.020).

DEFINITIONS

Abuse - The willful action or inaction that
intimidation, or punishment on a vulnerable adult.
In instances of abuse of a vulnerable

the abuse is presumed to cause physical harm, pain, or mental anguish. Abuse includes
sexual abuse, mental abuse, physical abuse, and exploitation of a vulnerable adult.

Consent - Express written consent granted after the vulnerable adult or his/her legal

to provide the goods and services that maintain physical or mental health of a vulnerable
adult, or that fails to avoid or prevent physical or mental harm or pain to a vulnerable adult;

magnitude as to constitute a clear and present danger to the vulnerable adult's health,
welfare, or safety, including but not limited to conduct prohibited under RCW 9A.42.100.

restraints unless the restraints are consistent with licensing requirements, and includes
restraints that are otherwise being used inappropriately.

Self-neglect - The failure of a vulnerable adult, not living in a facility, to provide for
him/herself the goods and services necessary for the vulnerable adult's physical or mental
health, and the absence of which impairs or threatens the vulnerable adult's well-being.
This definition may include a vulnerable adult who is receiving services through home
health, hospice, or a home care agency, or an individual provider when the neglect is not a
result of inaction by that agency or individual provider.

Sexual abuse - Any form of non-consensual sexual contact, including but not limited
to, unwanted or inappropriate touching, rape, sodomy, sexual coercion, sexually explicit
photographing, and sexual harassment. Sexual abuse includes any sexual contact

of a program authorized under RCW Chapter 71A.12, and a vulnerable adult living in
that facility or receiving service from a program authorized under RCW Chapter 71A.12,
whether or not it is consensual.

Vulnerable adult- Includes a person 60 years of age or older who has the functional,
inability to care for him/herself; is found to be incapacitated under
mental, or physical
RCW Chapter 11.88; has a developmental disability as defined under RCW 71A.10.020;
is admitted to any facility; is receiving services from home health, hospice, or home care
agencies licensed or required to be licensed under RCW Chapter 70.127; is receiving

services from a personal aide.

326.3 MANDATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
Pursuant to RCW 74.34.020(8) any officer of the Spokane Police Department is considered
a mandated reporter. When there is reasonable cause to believe that abandonment,
abuse, sexual or physical assault, financial exploitation, or neglect of a vulnerable adult
has occurred, mandated reporters shall immediately report to the Department of Social
and Health Services, Adult Protective Services (APS) regardless of jurisdiction (RCW
74.34.035).

RECORDS DIVISION RESPONSIBILITY

326.3.1
The Records Division is responsible for providing a copy of the vulnerable adult abuse report
to the Department of Social and Health Services/APS. This requirement is applicable even
if the initial call was received from Department of Social and Health Services.

326.4 OFFICER RESPONSE
All incidents involving actual or suspected elder and dependent adult abuse shall be fully
investigated and appropriately documented.

INITIAL RESPONSE

326.4.1
Officers may be called upon to effect a forced entry as the first responder to the scene of a
suspected elder abuse. Entry should be immediate when it appears reasonably necessary
to protect life or property. When the need for an emergency entry is not evident, officers
should seek supervisory approval. Officers must be prepared to provide emergency care
pending the arrival of medical personnel, if not already present.

Abuse of Vulnerable Adults

STABILIZE THE SITUATION

326.4.2
Officers must quickly assess the situation in an effort to ensure the immediate safety of all
persons. Officers shall also consider the following:

(a) Attempt to identify the victim, suspect and witnesses as well as the roles and
relationships of all parties. Parties should be interviewed separately whenever
possible. Frequently it is wrongfully assumed that vulnerable adults are incapable
of accurately reporting the incident. Do not automatically discount the statement of
an elderly person.

(b) Preserve the crime scene where evidence may be present. All persons should be
removed from the scene until it has been photographed and processed. Any evidence
such as injuries that may change in appearance should be photographed immediately.
Assess and define the nature of the problem. Officers should assess the available
information to determine the type(s) of abuse that may have taken place or the
potential for abuse in the future that may be eliminated by our intervention.

(c)

(d) Make on-scene arrests when appropriate. Immediate arrest of an abuser (especially
when the abuser/suspect is a family member or caretaker) may leave the vulnerable
adult victim without necessary support and could result in institutionalization. The
effect of an arrest on the victim should be considered and weighed against the
assessed risk, domestic violence laws and the competent victim's desires. The
present and future safety of the victim is of utmost importance and institutionalization
is generally preferable to continued victimization.

SUPPORT PERSONNEL

326.4.3
The following person(s) should be considered for notification and response if it appears an
in-depth investigation is appropriate:

Patrol supervisor
Detective personnel
Evidence collection personnel
DSHS/APS personnel

EMERGENCY PROTECTIVE ORDERS

326.4.4
In any situation which an officer reasonably believes that an elder or dependant adult is in
immediate and present danger of abuse based on an allegation of a recent incident of abuse
or threat of abuse (other than financial abuse alone), the officer should make an attempt to
facilitate a protective order against the person alleged to have committed or threatened such
abuse pursuant to RCW 74.34.110; 74.34.150; 74.34.210; or other applicable statutes.

Adult Protective Services is responsible for obtaining the protective order.

ELDER ABUSE REPORTING

326.5
Every allegation of vulnerable adult abuse shall be documented. Reporting of cases of
vulnerable adult abuse is confidential and will only be released as per Policy Manual § 810.
The following information should be provided in addition to the general information provided
on the crime report (RCW 74.34.035(7) and 74.34.040):

The name and address of the person making the report
The name of address of the vulnerable adult and the name of the facility or agency

Policy Manual

Discriminatory Harassment

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

328.1
This policy is intended to prevent department members from being subjected to
discrimination or sexual harassment.

POLICY

328.2
The Spokane Police Department is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to
creating and maintaining a work environment that is free of all forms of discriminatory
harassment, including sexual harassment and retaliation. The Department will not tolerate
discrimination against employees in hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation, fringe
benefits and other privileges of employment. The Department will take preventive and
corrective action to address any behavior that violates this policy or the rights it is designed
to protect.

The non-discrimination policies of the Department may be more comprehensive than state
or federal law. Conduct that violates this policy may not violate state or federal law but still
could subject a member to discipline.

328.3

DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED

DISCRIMINATION

328.3.1
The Department prohibits all forms of discrimination, including any employment-related
action by an employee that adversely affects an applicant or employee and is based on
race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin or ancestry, genetic information, disability,
military service, sexual orientation and other classifications protected by law.

Discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, is verbal or physical conduct that
demeans or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual based upon that individual's
protected class.
It has the effect of interfering with an individual's work performance or
creating a hostile or abusive work environment.

Conduct that may, under certain circumstances, constitute discriminatory harassment,
can include making derogatory comments, crude and offensive statements or remarks,
making slurs or off-color jokes, stereotyping, engaging in threatening acts, making indecent
gestures, pictures, cartoons, posters or material, making inappropriate physical contact,
or using written material or department equipment and/or systems to transmit or receive
offensive material, statements or pictures. Such conduct is contrary to department policy
and to the department's commitment to a discrimination free work environment.

Retaliation is treating a person or applicant differently or engaging in acts of reprisal or
intimidation against the person because he/she has engaged in protected activity, filed
a charge of discrimination, participated in an investigation or opposed a discriminatory
practice. Retaliation will not be tolerated.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT

328.3.2
The Department prohibits all
forms of discrimination and discriminatory harassment,
including sexual harassment. It is unlawful to harass an applicant or an employee because
of that person's sex.

INVESTIGATION DILIGENCE

332.2.1
Members of this department should accept any report, including any telephonic report, of
a missing person, including runaways, without delay and shall give priority to the handling
of these reports over the handling of reports relating to crimes involving property. The
investigative actions include the following:

(a) Make an assessment of reasonable steps to be taken to locate the person.

(b)

If the missing person is under 16-years of age, or there is evidence the person is
at-risk or endangered, the Department should broadcast a "be-on-the-lookout" radio
transmission without delay within this jurisdiction.

The agency having jurisdiction over the missing person's residence normally will handle
the case after the initial report is taken, however department members may assist in the
investigation on a person who was last seen in this jurisdiction.

TASK FORCE ON MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN

332.2.2
The Washington State Patrol Multiagency Taskforce on Missing and Exploited Children is

(c)

Technical assistance.

Personnel training.

(d) Referral for assistance from local, state, national, and international agencies.

ENDANGERED AND RUNAWAY JUVENILES

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

The juvenile is a runaway from home or official child placement.

If there is reason to believe, based upon the totality of the circumstances that the
juvenile would be in danger if not taken into custody.
In such case the officer shall
report the circumstance and custody to the Department of Social and Health Services.

A juvenile court has determined that the juvenile has violated a placement order or
has issued a court order to take custody of a juvenile.

There is reasonable suspicion that a child is being unlawfully harbored in violation of
RCW 13.32A.080.

Missing Person Reporting

Whenever practicable, the officer should inform a supervisor of the circumstances prior to
taking a child into protective custody. If prior notification is not practicable, officers should
contact a supervisor promptly after taking a child into protective custody. The officer should
also inform the juvenile of the reason for the custody.

Officers shall not extend beyond the amount of time reasonably necessary to transport the
child to a destination authorized under RCW 13.32A.060. Officers should maintain custody
of a juvenile until the person, agency or entity to whom the child is released agrees to accept
custody.

Officers who transport juveniles to a crisis residential center who were either a runaway or
endangered child shall, within 24 hours of delivering the child to the center, provide to the
center a written report detailing the reasons the officer took the child into custody.

Endangered and runaway juveniles, except when in custody for separate criminal offenses,
are status offenders. Status offenders may not be detained in police jails or lockups. They
may not be held in a detention environment or come into contact with adults in custody in
the station.

CRIME INFORMATION CENTER

332.2.4
The Washington State Patrol (WSP) Missing and Unidentified Persons Unit (MUPU) assists
law enforcement agencies and parents in locating missing persons. At the request of a
parent, legal custodian or guardian who has reported a child as having run away from
home, WSP will make the information about the runaway child available on its website
(RCW 43.43.510(2)(a)).

At the time a report is taken for a missing or runaway child, officers should inform
parents of the service provided by WSP and direct them to the appropriate website
(http://www.wsp.wa.gov/crime/mpufaqs.htm).

ENDANGERED MISSING PERSON ADVISORY

334.5
The Endangered Missing Person Advisory is a voluntary partnership between law
enforcement, other government agencies and local broadcasters to rapidly disseminate
information to law enforcement agencies, the media and the public about a missing and
endangered person in circumstances that do not qualify for an AMBER Alert.

occur:

(a) Officer(s) will be promptly assigned to contact the victim, witness, or reporting party

to investigate the matter further as circumstances may dictate.

(b) A supervisor should be notified of the circumstances as soon as practical.

(c) Once "in progress" aspects of any such situation have been stabilized (e.g., treatment
of victims, apprehension of present suspects, etc.), the assigned officer(s) will take
all reasonable steps to preserve available evidence that may tend to establish that a
hate crime was involved.

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Disciplinary Policy

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

340.1
This policy establishes standards of conduct that are consistent with the values and mission
of this department and are expected of its members. The standards contained in this policy
are not intended to be an exhaustive list of requirements and prohibitions but they do identify
many of the important matters concerning member conduct. Members are also subject to
provisions contained throughout this manual as well as any additional guidance on conduct
that may be disseminated by the Department or the member's supervisors.

This policy applies to all employees (full- and part-time), reserve officers and volunteers.

DISCIPLINE POLICY

340.2
The continued employment of every employee of this department shall be based on conduct
that reasonably conforms to the guidelines set forth herein. Failure of any employee to
meet the guidelines set forth in this policy, whether on-duty or off-duty, may be cause for
disciplinary action.

An employee's off-duty conduct shall be governed by this policy to the extent that it is related
to act(s) that may materially affect or arise from the employee's ability to perform official
duties or to the extent that it may be indicative of unfitness for his/her position.

PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE

340.2.1
The administration of discipline is generally expected to be progressive in nature,
with relatively minor violations of rules resulting in minor disciplinary action for first
offenders. Repetitive similar violations, or more serious violations, would generally result
in progressively more serious forms of discipline being administered.

Nothing in this policy is intended to preclude the administration of more serious forms of
discipline, including termination, for a first offense when warranted by the seriousness of
the offense.

CONDUCT WHICH MAY RESULT IN DISCIPLINE

340.3
The following list of causes for disciplinary action constitutes a portion of the disciplinary
standards of this department. This list is not intended to cover every possible type of
misconduct and does not preclude the recommendation of disciplinary action for specific
action or inaction that is detrimental to efficient department service:

COMPUTER AND COPIER HARD DRIVES

342.9
The Spokane Police Department handles sensitive law enforcement related data and
information. This information is often stored on computers, copiers and other devices
owned by the Police department.

Once a device, copier or computer is to be taken out of service by the department,
the hard drive within that device must be destroyed in compliance with guidelines set
forth by the following governing agencies, policies or laws. Federal mandates require
compliance with stringent laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act (HIPPA), the Gramm-Leach-Biley Act (GLB), Personal Information and Protection
and Electronics Documents Act (PIPEDA), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) to protect
medical, consumer, personal and financial records, respectively. Additionally, government
agencies must comply with security-relevant policies, such as DISA's Security Technical
Implementation Guide Requirements, NSTISSP #11 and DOD Directive 8500. FIPS
Pub-199 will act as the policy regarding security categorization levels.

To meet these requirements, the internal hard drives will be removed and gathered by LEIS,
recorded by serial number and delivered to the Office of Professional Standards. The Office
of Professional Standards will complete an audit and conduct and witness departmental
computer hard drive destruction and verify departmental compliance with the standards set
forth. The Office of Professional Standards will retain the necessary records.

Electronic Reporting

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

343.1
The accurate and timely reporting of police reports and information is a primary function
and duty of law enforcement. The appropriate use of technology in accomplishing that
function requires standard usage and policy. While this policy is specific to the Xpediter
product, the principles and practices should be extended to any electronic method of report
documentation.

DEFINITIONS

343.2
Xpediter C/S: A "Client/Server" relational database computer program. This program
allows you to collect, store, sort, and retrieve data for cases and then print the case
information onto forms or reports.

Xpediter Server: The central computer that is connected to the network. This is where the
main Xpediter C/S database is stored.

Network Client: Any computer that is connected to the Xpediter server computer. The
desktop icon will be green, indicating the computer is currently a network client.

Mobile Client: A computer that is not directly connected to the Xpediter server computer.
The desktop icon will be red. Computers in a vehicle, such as laptops and MDDs are mobile
clients. Mobile clients need to synchronize their data daily because they do not have a
direct connection to the Xpediter server. All reports created from a mobile client must be
transferred to the Xpediter server before they can be approved.

Control Center: The heart of the Xpediter C/S program is the control center. All modules
and features of this program will be accessed from it. This is the first screen that a user will
see after logging on to Xpediter C/S.

Approval Module: The approval module allows supervisors to review, approve, and/or
return reports submitted by officers.

Messaging Module: The Messaging module allows users to send and receive messages
from other users in the Xpediter C/S system.

ELECTRONIC REPORTING

343.3
All officers serving in the Uniformed Bureau are expected to be proficient in the use of the
Xpediter C/S report-writing program, and will be required to attend Xpediter C/S certification
training. Upon completion of Xpediter C/S certification training, officers will use the Xpediter
C/S report-writing program to write reports.

Officers should complete incident reports prior to returning to service. If an officer is unable
to complete a report immediately, they can save it on a portable memory device or transfer
it to the Xpediter server and complete it later (see § 344.6, delayed reporting writing).
All incomplete reports must be transferred to the Xpediter server by the end of the shift.
Delayed reporting necessitates supervisory approval.

DISTRIBUTING REPORTS

343.4
The Records Division will continue to be the main source for the distribution of police
reports. No copies of incomplete or pending reports will be used as a work product. If the
Records Division, Investigations, or case screening needs a copy of one of these reports,
a supervisor will be notified.

343.5 WRITING REPORTS

(a) Supervisors and officers will be responsible for synchronizing mobile client computers
from the Xpediter server. Laptop computers will be synchronized at the beginning of
the shift. A mobile client at a cop shop will be synchronized prior to writing reports.
Officers and supervisors will log in with their own personal user identification and
password. Passwords must be changed quarterly. Utilizing another's password is
prohibited. Officers will not leave the Xpediter C/S program running when it is not in
use. This will insure that a report is not written using another person's account.

(b) When an officer has completed a report from a mobile client, they will transfer that
report to the Xpediter server for supervisor approval. Officers will use the "Monitor
Button" to confirm that transfers are successful. The transferred report is then stored
on the Xpediter server and can only be viewed and altered from a network client. Only
the submitting officer can alter a report that has not been approved by a supervisor.

(c)

All reports written on mobile clients, whether finished or not, must be transferred to
the Xpediter server by the end of the officer's shift. A copy of every report written will
be transferred to the officer's portable memory device or to their personal folder on the
'H' drive. All reports will then be manually deleted from the mobile client computers.

(d) Officers who are assigned laptops will properly shut down all computer applications
and turn off the laptop at the end of their shift. Computers will then be placed in the
laptop cabinets for storage. Officers will not take the laptops home without supervisory
authorization nor will they leave the laptops in a patrol vehicle once they have secured.

(e) Reports will be allowed to remain temporarily on a mobile client computer only when
the report cannot be transferred to a portable memory device, the officer's personal
'H' drive folder, or to the Xpediter server. In these situations the officers will call the
help desk at 625-4099 giving their name, location of the mobile client, and the problem
that was encountered. If the report was written at a cop shop mobile client, the officer
will be responsible to return to that mobile client to delete his/her report. This will
take place within one workweek of writing the report and when the Xpediter server
connection has been restored.

(f) When multiple officers are writing reports for the same incident, only the primary officer
will write the original face sheet. If an arrest was made, only the primary officer will
list the charges in his report. All other officers will use the supplemental form located
in the report module.

(g) At the start of every shift, officers will be responsible to check the Control Center for
returned and incomplete reports. This check must be completed from a network client
computer.

(h) At the start of every shift, supervisors will be responsible for checking the Control
Center for returned and incomplete reports of officers from his/her team. This check
must be completed from a network client computer.

(i)

At the end of every shift, officers will check the Control Center to insure all completed
reports are either in "pending" or "approved" status. This check must be completed
from a network client computer. All arrest reports must be approved prior to securing
at the end of shift.

APPROVAL PROCESS

(a) Supervisors will review pending reports in the approval module from a network
client computer. Supervisors should review reports periodically during their shift and
approve or return all pending reports before the end of their shift.

If reports are correct and complete,
appropriate investigative unit for follow-up if appropriate and approve the report.

the supervisors will route the report to the

Supervisors will electronically return insufficient reports to the officer using the
approval module. The supervisor will use our e-mail system to inform the officer of
the additional information needed to complete the report. The approving supervisor
will e-mail a copy of this message to the involved officer's supervisor.

(d) All arrest reports must be approved by a supervisor prior to the end of the officers'

shift.

If an arrest report is to be returned and the officer cannot be reached, the supervisor
reviewing the report will create a supplemental report in Xpediter C/S explaining the
reason the report is insufficient prior to approving the insufficient report. The reviewing
supervisor will notify the officer's supervisor that the officer left prior to getting the
arrest report approved.

Report Preparation

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

344.1
Report preparation is a major part of each officer's job. The purpose of reports is to
document sufficient information to refresh the officer's memory and to provide sufficient
information for follow-up investigation and successful prosecution. Report writing is the
subject of substantial formalized training and on-the-job training.

REPORT PREPARATION

344.1.1
Employees should ensure that reports are sufficiently detailed for their purpose and free
from errors prior to submission. It is the responsibility of the assigned employee to complete
and submit all reports taken during the shift before going off-duty unless permission to hold
the report has been approved by a supervisor. Generally, reports requiring prompt follow-up
action on active leads, or arrest reports where the suspect remains in custody should not
be held.

Handwritten reports must be prepared legibly.
If the report is not legible, the submitting
employee will be required by the reviewing supervisor to promptly make corrections and
resubmit the report. Employees who dictate reports shall use appropriate grammar, as
content is not the responsibility of the typist. Employees who generate reports on computers
are subject to all requirements of this policy.

All reports shall accurately reflect
the persons involved, all pertinent
the identity of
information seen, heard, or assimilated by any other sense, and any actions taken.
Employees shall not suppress, conceal or distort the facts of any reported incident, nor
shall any employee make a false report orally or in writing. Generally, the reporting
employee's opinions should not be included in reports unless specifically identified as such.

REQUIRED REPORTING

344.2
Written reports are required in all of the following situations on the appropriate department
approved form unless otherwise approved by a supervisor.

CRIMINAL ACTIVITY REPORTING

344.2.1
When an employee responds to a call for service, or as a result of self-initiated activity
becomes aware of any activity where a crime has occurred, the employee is required to
document the activity. The fact that a victim is not desirous of prosecution is not an exception
to documenting a report. The following are examples of required documentation:

(a)

(b)

(c)

In every instance where a felony has occurred, the documentation shall take the form
of a written crime report.
In every instance where a misdemeanor crime has occurred and the victim desires a
report, the documentation shall take the form of a written crime report. If the victim
does not desire a report, the incident will be recorded on the CAD incident history for
the call.
In every case where force is used against any person by police personnel per Policy
Manual § 300.4.

(d) All incidents involving domestic violence.
(e) All arrests.

surrounding the incident and a determination will be made on how to proceed. The following
cases shall be appropriately investigated and documented using the approved report:

(a) Sudden or accidental deaths.

(b) Suicides

(c) Homicide or suspected homicide.

(e)

Found dead bodies or body parts.

(d) Unattended deaths (No physician in attendance within 36 hours preceding death).

INJURY OR DAMAGE BY CITY PERSONNEL

Additionally, reports shall be taken involving damage to city property, city equipment, or
to the property of another by a city employee.

be corrected or modified by the authoring officer only with the knowledge and authorization
of a supervisor.

DELAYED REPORT WRITING

344.6
This section formalizes the process for delaying the writing of certain miscellaneous reports.

Identity Theft

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

362.1
The purpose of this policy is to provide employees with protocols for accepting, recording,
and investigating the crime of identity theft. Identity theft is one of the fastest growing and
most serious economic crimes in the United States for financial institutions, businesses,
organizations and persons whose identifying information has been illegally used.
It can
also be a tool that terrorists and those who are attempting to evade the law can use to
their advantage. Therefore, the Spokane Police Department shall take those measures
necessary to record criminal complaints, assist victims in contacting other relevant
investigative and consumer protection agencies, and work with other federal, state and
local law enforcement and reporting agencies to identify perpetrators.

DEFINITIONS

362.2
Identity Theft: No person may knowingly obtain, possess, use, or transfer a means of
identification or financial information of another person, with the intent to commit, or to aid
or abet, any crime.

Person: To include any natural person and, where relevant, a corporation, joint stock
association, or an unincorporated association.

Financial information: Any of the following information identifiable to the individual that
concerns the amount and conditions of an individual's assets, liabilities, or credit: Account
information concerning an account; and codes,
numbers and balances;
passwords, social security numbers, tax identification numbers, driver's license or permit
numbers, state identicard numbers issued by the Department of Licensing, and other
information held for the purpose of account access or transaction initiation.

transactional

Means of Identification: Information or an item that is not describing finances or credit but
is personal to or identifiable with an individual or other person, including: A current or former
name of the person, telephone number, an electronic address, or identifier of the individual
or a member of his or her family, including the ancestor of the person; information relating
to a change in name, address, telephone number, or electronic address or identifier of the
individual or his or her family; a social security, driver's license, or tax identification number
of the individual or a member of his or her family; and other information that could be used
to identify the person, including unique biometric data.

JURISDICTION

362.3
Identity theft is punishable under federal law "when any person knowingly transfers or uses,
without lawful authority, a means of identification of another person with the intent to commit,
or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a felony under any applicable state
or local law and state law" (18U.S.C. 1028(a)(7)).

Identity theft is punishable under Washington State law RCW 9.35.020.

The crime will be considered to have been committed in any locality where the person
whose means of identification or financial information was appropriated resides, or in which
any part of the offense took place, regardless of whether the defendant was ever actually
in that locality.

Identity Theft

362.4

REPORTING

(a)

In an effort to maintain uniformity in reporting, officers presented with the crime of
identity theft shall initiate a report for victims residing within the jurisdiction of this
department. For incidents of identity theft occurring outside this jurisdiction, officers
should observe the following:

For any victim not residing within this jurisdiction, the officer may either take a
courtesy report to be forwarded to the victim's residence agency or the victim
should be encouraged to promptly report the identity theft to the law enforcement
agency where he or she resides.

(b) While the crime of identity theft should be reported to the law enforcement agency
where the victim resides, officers of this department should investigate and report
crimes occurring within this jurisdiction which have resulted from the original identity
theft (e.g., the identity theft occurred elsewhere, but the credit card fraud occurred
and is reported in this jurisdiction).

Fully record information concerning criminal acts that may have been committed
illegally using another's personal identity as covered by state and federal law.

If the victim has filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, a copy of
that report may be attached to the police report, documenting the details of the
identity theft.

Obtain or verify as appropriate, identifying information of the victim, which may
include date of birth, social security number, driver's license number, other photo
identification, current and most recent prior addresses, telephone numbers,
fingerprint and photograph.

Document the nature of the fraud or other crimes committed in the victim's name.

Determine which types of personal identifying information may have been used
to commit these crimes (i.e., social security number, driver's license number,
birth certificate, financial account information, etc.) and whether any of these
have been lost, stolen or potentially misappropriated.

Document any information concerning whether the crime took place,
financial
whereabouts of the victim at the time of these events.

the
institutions or related companies involved and the residence or

Determine whether the victim has knowledge or belief that a specific person or
persons have used the victim identity to commit fraud or other crimes.

Determine whether the victim is willing to assist in the prosecution of suspects
identified in the crime.

Determine if the victim has filed a report of the crime with other law enforcement
agencies and whether such agency provided the complainant with a report
number.

10. Determine whether or not

the victim was a relatively recent victim of a
precipitating crime, i.e. vehicle prowling, vehicle theft, mail theft, burglary, etc.
If so, cross reference the identity theft report with the original data acquisition
report.

11.

If not otherwise provided, document/describe the crime, the documents or
information used, and the manner in which the victim's identifying information
was obtained.

officers and immediately to intelligence agencies and federal agencies, if it
appears to have national security implications.

ASSISTING VICTIMS

362.5
Officers taking reports of identity theft should take those steps reasonably possible to
help victims resolve their problem. This may include providing victims with the following
suggestions where appropriate.

(a) Provide the victim with a copy of the Spokane Police Department Identity Theft Victim
Packet. If the packet is not available in the field, provide the victim with information
to obtain the packet, i.e. download from the department website, contact the police
front desk, etc. The information suggested below is listed in further detail in the ID
Theft Victim packet.

(b) Provide the victim with the report number and instructions on how to obtain a copy of

the report.

(c)

Provide the identity theft victim with the opportunity and/or information if applicable to
have their information entered into the WACIC Identity Theft Victim file, see below.

(d) Advise the victim to cancel each compromised credit or debit card.

(e) Advise the victim to contact any financial institutions to cancel existing, compromised

or potentially compromised accounts.

(f)

Recommend the identity theft victim file a "fraud alert" by contacting each of the
three major consumer reporting agencies and to add a victim's statement requesting
creditors contact the victim before opening new accounts in the victim's identity.

(g) Advise the identity theft victim of

to obtain a "security freeze", per
their right
Washington State Law, RCW 19.182.170. The freeze prevents the victim's credit file
from being shared with potential creditors. Each of the three major credit reporting
agencies must be contacted in writing with a proof of identity and a copy of the police
report.

(h) Advise the victim of their right to obtain information and documentation regarding any
transactions conducted using his or her identity by unauthorized persons, per the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, FCRA 609(e).

(i)

the victim report

Suggest
to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC
at 1-877-IDTHEFT) or on-line www.consumer.gov, which acts as the nation's
clearinghouse for information related to identity theft crimes. The FTC has trained
counselors that can assist in resolving credit related problems.

VOLUNTARY FINGERPRINTS

362.6
Whenever a person claiming to be a victim of identity theft appears before the Spokane
Police Department and requests an impression of his or her fingerprints to be made:

(a) Spokane Police Department will refer the victim to Spokane County Forensics Unit to

take fingerprints.

(b) Spokane County Forensics Unit will make the required copies of the impressions on
forms marked "Voluntary Finger/Palm Print and Photo Submission form." The victim
will be provided with the appropriate documents to forward to WSP (RCW 43.43.760).

INVESTIGATIONS

362.7
Investigations of identity theft shall include but not be limited to the following actions where
appropriate:

(a) Review identity theft reports while reviewing the daily fraud reports. If the victim has
not received victim assistance/information, forward victim information if applicable.
Not all identity theft reports will be investigated by detectives; however the identity
theft victim will need victim information in order to correct the fraudulent accounts and
activity(s) conducted in their identity.

(b) Review the assigned identity theft report and any other cross referenced or related

incident reports.

(c) Determine whether or not the victim completed and forwarded an Identity Theft Packet
to law enforcement. Contact the victim as necessary for clarification/expansion of the
information.

(d) Contact other involved or potentially involved investigative departments within
the Spokane Police Department as well as other law enforcement agencies for
collaboration and avoidance of duplication.

(e)

Following supervisory review and departmental processing, the initial report should
be forwarded to the appropriate detective for follow up investigation, coordination with
other agencies and prosecution as circumstances dictate.

362.8 WACIC IDENTITY THEFT VICTIM FILE
Identity Theft Reports may be entered into the WACIC/NCIC Identity Theft Victim File,
pursuant to WSP ACCESS Manual Chapter 15.

(a)

If the victim of identity theft wants their information entered into the WACIC Identity
Theft File database, the following steps will be taken.

(b) Criteria: Someone is using a means of identification of the victim (denoted in the
Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 as any name or number that
may be used, alone or in conjunction with any other information, to identify a specific
individual) without the victim's permission.

The victim must have an identity theft report on file with law enforcement.

The victim will provide adequate identification which may include the victim's
name, date of birth, Social Security number, voluntary fingerprints and
photographs to verify their identity.

(c)

Procedure

The victim and a commissioned officer must complete a victim profile (Identity
Theft Consent Waiver) and select a unique password.

The victim will be referred to the front desk officer who will then contact the
Records Division and have the data entered into the WACIC/NCIC Identity Theft
File.

During subsequent encounters by law enforcement, the Identity Theft Victim
File will be automatically checked during WACIC/NCIC name checks. The
officer will receive a response listing the victim profile, including the password,
thereby providing the officer with the information necessary to verify that the
person encountered is the victim or that the person may be using a false
identity. The response should be considered along with additional information
or a circumstance surrounding the encounter before the officer takes action.

Limited English Proficiency Services

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

368.1
Language barriers can sometimes inhibit or even prohibit individuals with limited English
proficiency (LEP) from gaining meaningful access to, or an understanding of important
rights, obligations and services.
It is therefore the policy of this department to take all
reasonable steps to ensure timely and equal access to all individuals, regardless of national
origin or primary language (Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, § 601, 42 USC 2000d).

DEFINITIONS

368.1.1
Limited English Proficient (LEP) - Designates individuals whose primary language is
not English and who have a limited ability to read, write, speak, or understand English.
LEP individuals may be competent in certain types of communication (e.g., speaking or
understanding), but still be LEP for other purposes such as reading or writing. Similarly, LEP
designations are context-specific. An individual may possess sufficient English language
skills to function in one setting, but these skills may be insufficient in other situations.

Bilingual - The ability to communicate in two languages fluently, including the ability to
communicate technical and law enforcement terminology. Bilingual includes a variety of
skill levels. For example, some bilingual individuals may be fluent enough to engage in
direct communications in a non-English language, but insufficiently fluent to interpret or
translate from one language into another. For example, a bilingual individual, depending
on his or her skill level, could be utilized to communicate fluently in a non-English language,
but not to interpret between two languages if he or she does not possess the specialized
skills necessary to interpret between two languages effectively.
In order to be utilized to
interpret or translate from one language into another an individual must possesses the skill,
training, and demonstrated competence to do so.

Interpretation - The act of listening to a communication in one language (source language)
and orally converting it to another language (target language) while retaining the same
meaning.

Translation - The replacement of written text from one language (source language) into an
equivalent written text (target language).

FOUR FACTOR ANALYSIS

368.2
Since there are potentially hundreds of languages department personnel could encounter,
the Department will utilize the four-factor analysis outlined in the United States Department
of Justice LEP Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients in determining which
measures will provide reasonable and meaningful access to various rights, obligations,
It is recognized that law enforcement contacts and
services and programs to everyone.
circumstances will vary considerably. This analysis therefore, must remain flexible and
requires an ongoing balance of the following four factors:

(a)

(b)

The number or proportion of LEP individuals eligible to be served or likely to be
encountered by officers or who may benefit from programs or services within the
Department's jurisdiction or a particular geographic area.

The frequency with which LEP individuals are likely to come in contact with officers,
programs or services.

Policy Manual

Limited English Proficiency Services

(c)

(d)

The nature and importance of the contact, program, information or service provided.

The cost of providing LEP assistance and the resources available.

As indicated above, the intent of this analysis is to provide a balance that reasonably
ensures meaningful access by LEP individuals to critical services while not imposing
undue burdens on the Department or its personnel.

While this department will not discriminate against or deny any individual access to services,
rights or programs based upon national origin or any other protected interest or right, the
above analysis will be utilized to determine the availability and level of assistance provided
to any LEP individual or group.

IDENTIFICATION OF LEP INDIVIDUAL'S LANGUAGE

368.2.1
The Department will utilize all reasonably available tools, such as language identification
cards, when attempting to determine an LEP individual's primary language in an effort to
avoid misidentifying that language.

TYPES OF LEP ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE

368.3
Depending on the balance of the above four factors, this department will make every
reasonable effort to provide meaningful and timely assistance to LEP individuals through
a variety of services, where available. LEP individuals may elect to accept interpreter
services offered by the Department at no cost or choose to provide their own interpreter
services at their own expense. Department personnel should document in any related
report whether the LEP individual elected to use interpreter services provided by the
Department or some other source. Department-provided interpreter services may include,
but are not limited to the following assistance methods.

BILINGUAL PERSONNEL

368.3.1
Personnel utilized for LEP services need not be certified as interpreters but must have
through established department procedures, a level of competence to
demonstrated,
ascertain whether his/her language skills are best suited to monolingual communications,
interpretation, translation, or all or none of these functions.

All personnel used for communication with LEP individuals must demonstrate knowledge
of the functions of an interpreter and the ethical issues involved when functioning as a
language conduit.
In addition, employees who serve as interpreters and/or translators
must have demonstrated competence in both English and the non-English language.
When bilingual personnel from this department are not available, personnel from other city
departments who have the requisite training may be requested.

368.3.2 WRITTEN FORMS AND GUIDELINES
This department will endeavor to provide frequently used and critical forms and guidelines
in languages most commonly represented within the community or a particular area and/or
provide interpretive services.

TELEPHONE INTERPRETER SERVICES

368.3.3
The Shift Commander and the Communications Manager will maintain a list of qualified
interpreter services. These services shall be available, with the approval of a supervisor,
to assist department personnel in communicating with LEP individuals via official cellular
telephones.

COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS AND OTHER SOURCES OF

368.3.4
INTERPRETATION
Where competent bilingual departmental personnel or other department-certified staff are
unavailable to assist, responsible members of the community who have demonstrated
competence in either monolingual (direct) communication and/or in interpretation and
translation (as noted above) may be called upon to assist in communication efforts.
Sources for these individuals may include neighboring police departments, university
languages and linguistics departments, local businesses, banks, churches, neighborhood
leaders and school officials. Department personnel should ensure that community
members are able to provide unbiased assistance. The nature of
the contact and
relationship between the LEP individual and the individual offering services must be
carefully considered (e.g., victim/suspect).

Except for exigent or very informal and non-confrontational circumstances, the use of an
LEP individual's bilingual friends or family members, particularly children, are generally not
recommended and department personnel shall make case-by-case determinations on the
appropriateness of using such individuals (for further guidance see section V(3) of the U.S.
DOJ Final Guidance available at the U.S. DOJ website).

LEP CONTACT SITUATIONS AND REPORTING
law enforcement contacts, services and individual rights are important,

368.4
While all
this
department will utilize the four-factor analysis to prioritize language services so that they
may be targeted where they are most needed.

Whenever any member of this department is required to complete a report or when other
documentation and interpretation or translation services are provided to any involved LEP
individual, such services should be noted in the related report.

RECEIVING AND RESPONDING TO REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE

368.4.1
In order to provide LEP individuals with meaningful access to police services when they are
victims of, or witnesses to, alleged criminal activity or other emergencies, this department
has designated its 9-1-1 lines as its top priority for language services. Department personnel
will make every reasonable effort to promptly accommodate such LEP individuals utilizing
9-1-1 lines through any or all of the above resources.

While 9-1-1 calls shall receive top priority, reasonable efforts should also be made to
accommodate LEP individuals seeking routine access to services and information by
utilizing the resources listed in this policy.

EMERGENCY CALLS TO 9-1-1

368.4.2
When a 9-1-1 call-taker determines that the caller is an LEP individual, the call-taker should
quickly determine whether sufficient information can be obtained to initiate an appropriate
If language assistance is still needed, the language is known and
emergency response.
a language-appropriate authorized interpreter is available in Combined Communications
Center, the call-taker should immediately connect the LEP caller to the interpreter.

If an appropriate authorized interpreter is not available, the call-taker will promptly connect
the LEP caller to the contracted telephonic interpretation service directly for assistance in
completing the call. Dispatchers will make every effort to dispatch a bilingual officer to the
assignment, if available.

FIELD ENFORCEMENT AND INVESTIGATIONS

368.4.3
Field enforcement will generally include such contacts as traffic stops, pedestrian stops,
serving warrants and restraining orders, crowd/traffic control and other routine field contacts
which may involve LEP individuals. The scope and nature of these activities and contacts
will inevitably vary. Department personnel must assess each situation to determine the
need and availability for translation services to all involved LEP individuals and utilize the
methods outlined in this policy to provide appropriate language assistance.

Although not every situation can be addressed within this policy,
it is important that
department personnel are able to effectively communicate the reason for a contact, the
need for information and the meaning or consequences of any enforcement action taken
with an LEP individual. It would, for example, be meaningless to request consent to search
if the person requesting is unable to effectively communicate with an LEP individual.

INVESTIGATIVE INTERVIEWS

368.4.4
In any situation where the translation of an interview may contain information that might
be used in a criminal trial, it is important to take certain steps to improve the chances
of admissibility. This includes interviews conducted during an investigation with victims,
witnesses, and suspects. In such situations, audio recordings of the interviews should be
made when reasonably possible. Identification and contact information for the interpreter
(e.g., name, address) should be documented so that the person can be subpoenaed for
trial if necessary.

Any person selected as an interpreter and/or
translator must have demonstrated
competence in both English and the non-English language involved and knowledge of the
functions of an interpreter that allows for correct and effective translation, and should not
be a person with an interest in the case. The person providing interpretation or translation
services may be required to establish the accuracy and trustworthiness of the interpretation
or translation to the court.

custodial
this department places a high priority on providing competent
interpretation during such situations. It is further recognized that miscommunication during
custodial interrogations may have a substantial impact on the evidence presented in any
related criminal prosecution. As such, department personnel providing interpretation
services or translated forms in these situations will have demonstrated competence in
interpretation/translation and make every reasonable effort to accurately interpret/translate
all communications with LEP individuals.

In order to ensure that translations during criminal investigations are documented accurately
and are admissible as evidence, audio recordings of interrogations, victim interviews and
witness interviews should be used whenever reasonably possible.

Employees providing translation services shall also be aware of the inherent communication
impediments to gathering information from the LEP individual throughout the booking
process or any other situation in which an LEP individual is within the control of department
personnel. Medical screening questions are commonly used to elicit information on an
individual's medical needs, suicidal inclinations, presence of contagious diseases, potential
illness, resulting symptoms upon withdrawal from certain medications, or the need to
segregate the arrestee from other prisoners. Therefore it is important for members of

Hearing Impaired/Disabled
Communications

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

370.1
Individuals who suffer from deafness, hearing impairment, blindness, impaired vision,
mental or other disabilities may encounter difficulties in gaining meaningful access to, or
In accordance with the
an understanding of important rights, obligations and services.
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and RCW 2.42.120 (4) and (5), it is therefore the
policy of this department to take all reasonable steps to accommodate such individuals in
any law enforcement contact.

FACTORS TO CONSIDER

370.2
Because the nature of any law enforcement contact may vary substantially from one
situation to the next, employees of
information
reasonably available to them when determining how to communicate with an individual
suffering from any disability. These factors may include, but are not limited to:

this department should consider all

(c)

The extent to which a disability is obvious or otherwise made known to the involved
Impaired or disabled individuals may be reluctant to acknowledge their
employee.
condition and may even feign a complete understanding of a communication despite
actual confusion.

The nature of the disability (e.g., total deafness or blindness vs. impairment).

The nature of the law enforcement contact (e.g., emergency vs. non-emergency,
custodial vs. consensual contact).

(d) Availability of resources to aid in communication.

When considering these and other available information, the involved employee(s) should
carefully balance all factors in an effort to reasonably ensure meaningful access by
individuals suffering from apparent disabilities to critical services while not imposing undue
burdens on the department or its officers.

INITIAL AND IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATIONS

370.2.1
Recognizing that various law enforcement encounters may be potentially volatile and/or
emotionally charged, department employees should remain alert to the possibility of
communication problems and exercise special care in the use of all gestures, and verbal
and written communication in an effort to minimize initial confusion and misunderstanding
when dealing with any individual(s) with known or suspected disabilities or communication
impairments.

TYPES OF ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE

370.3
this
Depending on the balance of the factors available for consideration at the time,
department will make every reasonable effort to provide meaningful and timely assistance
to disabled individuals through a variety of services, where available. Disabled individuals
may elect to accept such assistance at no cost, choose to provide their own communication
services at their own expense or any combination thereof. In any situation, the individual's
expressed choice of communication method shall be given primary consideration and

honored unless the employee can adequately demonstrate that another effective method
of communication exists under the circumstances.

Officers should document
the type of communication utilized in any related report
and whether a disabled or impaired individual elected to use services provided by the
department or some other identified source. Department provided services may include,
but are not limited to the following:

FIELD RESOURCES

370.3.1
Individual officers and employees are encouraged to utilize resources immediately available
to them in any contact with a known or suspected disabled or impaired person. Examples
of this would include such simple methods as:

(a) Hand gestures or written communications exchanged between the employee and a

deaf or hearing impaired individual.

(b)

(c)

Facing an individual utilizing lip reading and speaking slowly and clearly.

Slowly and clearly speaking or reading simple terms to any visually or mentally
impaired individual.

AUDIO RECORDINGS AND ENLARGED PRINT

370.3.2
From time to time, the department may develop audio recordings of important information
needed by blind or visually impaired individuals. In the absence of such audio recordings,
employees may elect to read aloud a department form or document such as a Citizen
Complaint form to a visually impaired individual or utilize a photocopier to enlarge printed
forms for a visually impaired individual.

TELEPHONE INTERPRETER SERVICES

370.3.3
The Combined Communications Center supervisor will maintain a list of qualified interpreter
services to be contacted at department expense to assist deaf or hearing impaired
individuals upon approval of a supervisor. When utilized, notification to such interpreters
shall be made at the earliest reasonable opportunity and the interpreter should be available
to respond within a reasonable time (generally not to exceed three hours).

TTY AND RELAY SERVICES

370.3.4
Individuals who are deaf or hearing impaired must be given the opportunity to use available
text telephones (TTY or TDD). All calls placed by such individuals through such services
shall be accepted by this department.

COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS

370.3.5
Depending on the circumstances, location and availability, responsible members of the
community may be available to provide qualified interpreter services, such as those who
are proficient in American Sign Language (ASL). Sources for these individuals may include
local businesses, banks, churches, neighborhood leaders and school officials. In addition
to such sources developed by individual officers, the department will attempt to maintain
and update a list of qualified community volunteers who may be available to respond within
a reasonable time.

370.3.6
FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF DISABLED OR IMPAIRED INDIVIDUAL
While family and friends of a disabled or impaired individual may frequently offer to assist
with interpretation, employees should carefully consider the circumstances before relying

Hearing Impaired/Disabled Communications

on such individuals. For example, children should not be relied upon except in emergency
or critical situations. Further, the nature of the contact and relationship between the
disabled individual and the individual offering services must be carefully considered (e.g.,
victim/suspect).

CONTACT SITUATIONS AND REPORTING

370.4
While all contacts, services, and individual rights are important, this department will carefully
consider reasonably available information in an effort to prioritize services to disabled and
impaired individuals so that such services and resources may be targeted where most
needed because of the nature and importance of the particular law enforcement activity
involved.

Whenever any member of this department is otherwise required to complete a report or
other documentation, and communication assistance is provided to any involved disabled
or impaired individual(s), such services should be noted in the related report.

RECEIVING AND RESPONDING TO REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE

370.4.1
In order to provide disabled and impaired individuals with meaningful access to law
enforcement services when they are victims of, or witnesses to, alleged criminal activity or
other emergencies, this department through Spokane County 911 Services, designated
its 9-1-1 lines as its top priority for assistance with such services. Department personnel
will make every reasonable effort to promptly accommodate such disabled and impaired
individuals utilizing 9-1-1 lines through any or all of the above resources.

While 9-1-1 calls shall receive top priority, it is also important that reasonable efforts be
made to accommodate disabled and impaired individuals seeking more routine access to
services and information from this department.

CUSTODIAL INTERROGATIONS AND BOOKINGS

370.4.2
In an effort to ensure the rights of all disabled and impaired individuals are protected during
this department places a high priority on providing
arrest and custodial
reasonable communication assistance during such situations. It is further recognized that
miscommunication during custodial interrogations may have a substantial impact on the
evidence presented in any related criminal prosecution. As such, department personnel
providing communication assistance in these situations will make every reasonable effort
to accurately and effectively communicate with disabled or impaired individuals.

interrogation,

Employees providing such assistance shall also be aware of the inherent communication
impediments to gathering information from disabled or impaired individuals throughout the
booking process or any other situation in which a disabled or impaired individual is within
the control of department personnel. Medical screening questions are commonly used to
elicit information on individual's medical needs, suicidal inclinations, presence of contagious
diseases, potential illness, resulting symptoms upon withdrawal from certain medications,
or the need to segregate the arrestee from other prisoners, therefore it is important for this
department to make every reasonable effort to provide effective communication assistance
in these situations.

(a)

Individuals who require communication aids (e.g., hearing aids) should be permitted
to retain such devices while in custody.

(b) While it may present officer safety or other logistical problems to allow a physically
disabled individual to retain devices such as a wheel chair or crutches during a
the removal of such items will require that other reasonable
custodial situation,

Hearing Impaired/Disabled Communications

accommodations be made to assist such individuals with access to all necessary
services.

(c)

Since medical screening is usually done by the jail staff at time of booking, and they
decide what is to remain with the arrestee, officers should also be aware of medical
issues.

FIELD ENFORCEMENT AND INVESTIGATIONS

370.4.3
Field enforcement will generally include such contacts as traffic stops, pedestrian stops,
serving warrants and restraining orders, crowd/traffic control and other routine field
contacts which may involve disabled or impaired individuals. The scope and nature of
these activities and contacts will inevitably vary, therefore the department recognizes that
it would be virtually impossible to provide immediate access to complete communication
services to every officer in the field. Each officer and/or supervisor must, however, assess
each such situation to determine the need and availability for communication assistance
to any and all involved disabled or impaired individuals.

Although not every situation can be addressed within this policy,
it is important that
employees are able to effectively communicate the reason for a contact, the need for
information and the meaning or consequences of any enforcement action taken with a
disabled or impaired individual. For example, it would be meaningless to verbally request
consent to search if the officer is unable to effectively communicate with a deaf individual.

COMMUNITY OUTREACH

370.4.4
Community outreach programs and other such services offered by this department have
become increasingly recognized as important to the ultimate success of more traditional
law enforcement duties. As such, this department will continue to work with community
groups, local businesses and neighborhoods to provide equal access to such programs
and services to disabled individuals and groups.

TRAINING

370.5
In an effort to ensure that all employees in public contact positions (or having contact with
those in custody) are properly trained, this department will provide periodic training in the
following areas:

(a) Employee awareness of related policies, procedures, forms and available resources.

(b) Employees having contact with the public (or those in our custody) are trained to work

effectively with in-person and telephone interpreters and related equipment.

(c)

Training for management staff, even if they may not interact regularly with disabled
individuals, in order that they remain fully aware of, and understand this policy, so
they can reinforce its importance and ensure its implementation by staff.

Child Safety Policy

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

380.1
The Spokane Police Department recognizes that children who are subjected to traumatic
events, such as the arrest of a parent or guardian, may experience negative emotional
effects that can last throughout the lifetime of the individual. After such an event the child
may not receive the appropriate care, which can lead to further emotional or physical
trauma. This policy is intended to provide guidelines for officers to take reasonable steps
to minimize the impact to the child when it becomes necessary to take action involving the
child's parent or guardian.

POLICY

380.1.1
It is the policy of this department to mitigate, to the extent reasonably possible, the stressful
experience children may have when their parent or caregiver is arrested. The Spokane
Police Department will endeavor to create a strong cooperative relationship with local, state
and community-based child social services to ensure an effective, collaborative response
that addresses the needs of affected children.

PROCEDURES DURING AN ARREST

380.2
When encountering an arrest situation officers should make reasonable attempts to
determine if the arrestee is responsible for minor dependent children. In some cases this
is obvious, such as when children are present. However, officers should inquire if the
person has any other dependent minor children who are without appropriate supervision.
The following steps should be taken:

(a)

(b)

(c)

Inquire about and confirm the location of any dependent minor children.

Look for evidence of children. Officers should be mindful that some arrestees may
conceal the fact that they have dependent children for fear their children may be taken
from them.

Inquire of witnesses, neighbors, friends and relatives of the arrestee as to whether
the person is responsible for a dependent child.

Whenever possible, officers should take reasonable steps to accomplish the arrest of a
parent or guardian out of the presence of his/her child. Removing children from the scene
in advance of the arrest will generally ensure the best outcome for the child.

Whenever it is safe to do so, officers should allow the parent to assure children that they will
be provided care. If this is not safe or if the demeanor of the in-custody parent suggests this
conversation would be non-productive, the Officer at the scene should explain the reason
for the arrest in age-appropriate language and offer reassurance to the children that both
parent and children will receive appropriate care.

AFTER AN ARREST

380.2.1
Whenever an arrest is made, the officer should take all reasonable steps to ensure the
safety of the arrestee's disclosed or discovered, dependent minor children.

Officers should allow the arrestee reasonable time to arrange for care of minor children.
Temporary placement of the child with family or friends may be appropriate. However, any

Policy Manual

Child Safety Policy

decision should give priority to a child-care solution that is in the best interest of the child.
In such cases the following guidelines should be followed:

(a) Allow the person reasonable time to arrange for the care of minor children with a

responsible party, as appropriate.

1.

Unless there is evidence to the contrary (e.g., signs of abuse, drug use,
unsafe environment), officers should respect the parent's judgment regarding
arrangements for child care.
It is generally best if the child remains with
relatives or family friends the child knows and trusts. Consideration regarding
the child's familiarity with the surroundings, comfort, emotional state and safety
should be paramount.

2.

Except when a court order exists limiting contact, the officer should attempt to
locate and place dependent children with the non-arrested parent or guardian.

(b) Provide for the immediate supervision of minor children until an appropriate caregiver

arrives.

(c) Notify the Department of Social and Health Services.

(d) Notify the field supervisor or Shift Commander of the disposition of minor children.

If children are at school or at a known location outside the household at the time of arrest,
the arresting officer should attempt to contact the school or other known location and inform
the principal or appropriate responsible adult of the parent's arrest and of the arrangements
being made for the care of the arrestee's children, and then record the result of such actions
in the associated report.

Officers shall promptly notify Child Protective Services (CPS) whenever a child under age
13 is present in a vehicle and his/her parent, guardian or legal custodian is arrested for a
drug or alcohol driving offense in accordance with the department Child Abuse Reporting
Policy.

REPORTING

380.2.2
For all arrests where children are present or living in the household, the reporting employee
will include information about the children, including names, gender, age and how they were
placed.

CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES

380.3
Whenever an arrestee is unwilling or incapable of arranging for the appropriate care of
any dependent minor children, the handling officer should consider taking children into
protective custody and placing them with the appropriate county child protective service
or other department-approved social service.

Only when other reasonable options are exhausted should a child be transported to the
police's facility, transported in a marked patrol car or taken into formal protective custody.

Under no circumstances should a child be left unattended or without appropriate care.

TRAINING

380.4
The Training Lieutenant is responsible to ensure that all personnel of this department
who may be involved in arrests affecting children, participate on a timely basis in
department-approved training on effective child safety when a parent or guardian is
arrested.

Service Animal Policy

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

382.1
Service animals play an important role in helping to overcome the limitations often faced
by people with disabilities. The Spokane Police Department recognizes this need and is
committed to making reasonable modifications to its policies, practices, and procedures in
accordance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to permit the
use of service animals that are individually trained to assist a person with a disability.

SERVICE ANIMALS

382.2
The ADA defines a service animal as any dog or miniature horse that is individually trained to
do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical,
sensory, psychiatric, intellectual or other mental disability. The work or tasks performed by
a service animal must be directly related to the owner's disability (28 CFR 35.104).

USE OF SERVICE ANIMALS

382.2.1
Some service animals may be readily identifiable. However, many do not have a distinctive
symbol, harness or collar. Service animals are not pets and may be trained by an individual
or organization to assist people with disabilities.

Examples of how service animals may be used to provide assistance include:

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

Guiding people who are blind or have low vision.

Alerting people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

Retrieving or picking up items, opening doors, or flipping switches for people who
have limited use of their hands, arms or legs.

Pulling wheelchairs.

Providing physical support and assisting with stability and balance.

Doing work or performing tasks for persons with traumatic brain injury, intellectual
disabilities, or psychiatric disabilities, such as reminding a person with depression to
take medication.

Alerting a person with anxiety to the onset of panic attacks, providing tactile
stimulation to calm a person with post-traumatic stress disorder, assisting people
with schizophrenia to distinguish between hallucinations and reality, and helping
people with traumatic brain injury to locate misplaced items or follow daily routines.

Service animals that are assisting individuals with disabilities are permitted in all public
facilities and areas where the general public is allowed. Department members are
expected to treat individuals with service animals with the same courtesy and respect that
the Spokane Police Department affords to all members of the public.

If an animal exhibits vicious behavior, poses a direct threat to the health of others or
unreasonably disrupts or interferes with normal business operations, an officer may direct
the owner to remove the animal from the premises. Barking alone is not a threat nor
does a direct threat exist if the person takes prompt, effective action to control the animal.
Each incident must be considered individually and past incidents alone are not cause for

excluding a service animal. Removal of a service animal may not be used as a reason to
refuse service to an individual with disabilities. Members of this department are expected
to provide all services as are reasonably available to an individual with a disability.

If it is apparent or if the officer is aware the animal is a service animal, the owner should
not be asked any questions as to the status of the animal.
If it is unclear whether an
animal meets the definition of a service animal, the officer should ask the individual only
the following questions:

•

•

Is the animal required because of a disability?

What task or service has the service animal been trained to perform?

If the individual explains that the animal is required because of a disability and has been
trained to work or perform at least one task, the animal meets the definition of a service
animal and no further questions as to the animal's status should be asked. The person
should not be questioned about his/her disabilities nor should the person be asked to
provide any license, certification or identification card for the service animal.

Service animals are not pets. Department members should not interfere with the important
work performed by a service animal by talking to, petting or otherwise initiating contact with
a service animal.

When handling calls of a complaint regarding a service animal, members of this department
should remain neutral and should be prepared to explain the ADA requirements concerning
service animals to the concerned parties. Businesses are required to allow service animals
to accompany their owner into all areas that other customers or members of the public are
allowed.

Absent a violation of law independent of the ADA, officers should take no enforcement
action beyond keeping the peace.
Individuals who believe they have been discriminated
against as a result of a disability should be referred to the Civil Rights Division of the U.S.
Department of Justice.

Off-Duty Law Enforcement Actions

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

386.1
The decision to become directly involved in a law enforcement action when off-duty
can place an officer as well as others at greater risk, and should be done with careful
consideration.

This policy is intended to provide guidelines for officers of the Spokane Police Department
with respect to taking law enforcement action while in an off-duty capacity.

POLICY

386.2
There is no legal requirement for off-duty officers to take direct law enforcement action.
Initiating law enforcement action while off-duty is generally discouraged. Officers should
not attempt to initiate any enforcement action when witnessing minor crimes. These minor
crimes would include for example, suspected intoxicated drivers, reckless driving and minor
Incidents such as these should be promptly reported to the appropriate
property crimes.
law enforcement agency by calling either Crime Check or 911. Officers are not expected to
place themselves in unreasonable peril. However, any sworn member of this department
who becomes aware of an incident or circumstances that he/she reasonably believes poses
an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death, or serious property damage may take
reasonable action to minimize the threat. When public safety or the prevention of major
property damage requires immediate action, officers should first consider reporting and
monitoring the activity and only take direct action as a last resort.

DECISION TO INTERVENE

386.3
The following list is not intended to be inclusive of every off-duty situation that may be
presented to an officer.

Should an officer decide to intervene, they should evaluate whether the action is necessary
or desirable, and should take into consideration the following:

(a) The tactical disadvantage of being alone and the fact that there may be multiple or
hidden suspects.

(b) The inability to communicate developing information to other responding units.

(c) The lack of needed equipment, e.g. handcuffs, OC, or baton.

(d) The lack of proper cover.

(e) The potential for increased risk to bystanders if the off-duty officer were to intervene.

(f) Unfamiliarity with the location or surroundings.

(g) The potential for the off-duty officer to be misidentified by other law enforcement officers
or members of the public.

Off-duty officers should consider waiting for on-duty, uniformed officers or deputies to
arrive, while gathering as much accurate information as possible, instead of immediately
intervening.

INTERVENTION PROCEDURE

386.3.1
If direct involvement is reasonably necessary, the officer should attempt to call or have
someone else call 9-1-1 to request immediate assistance. The operator should be informed
that an off-duty officer is on scene as well as providing a description of the off-duty officer
when practical.

Whenever practicable, the officer should loudly and repeatedly indentify him/herself as
a Spokane City Police Officer until acknowledged. Officer identification should also be
displayed.

INCIDENTS OF PERSONAL INTEREST

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

386.3.4
When encountering a non-uniformed officer or deputy in public, uniformed officers should
wait for acknowledgment by the non-uniformed officer/deputy in case he/she needs to
maintain an undercover capability.

REPORTING

386.4
Any off-duty officer who engages in any law enforcement activity, regardless of jurisdiction,
shall notify the Shift Commander as soon as practicable. The Shift Commander shall
determine whether a report should be filed by the employee. Officers should cooperate

Bias-Based Policing

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

402.1
This policy provides guidance to department members and establishes appropriate controls
to ensure that employees of the Spokane Police Department do not engage in racial- or
bias-based profiling or violate any related laws while serving the community.

402.1.1
Definitions related to this policy include:

DEFINITION

Racial- or bias-based profiling - An inappropriate reliance on factors such as race,
ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, economic status, age, cultural
group, disability or affiliation with any other similar identifiable group as a factor in deciding
whether to take law enforcement action or to provide service.

POLICY

402.2
The Spokane Police Department is committed to providing law enforcement services to the
community with due regard for the racial, cultural or other differences of those served. It
is the policy of this department to provide law enforcement services and to enforce the law
equally, fairly and without discrimination toward any individual or group.

Race, ethnicity or nationality, religion, sex, sexual orientation, economic status, age, cultural
group, disability or affiliation with any other similar identifiable group shall not be used as
the basis for providing differing levels of law enforcement service or the enforcement of the
law.

RACIAL- OR BIAS-BASED PROFILING PROHIBITED

402.3
Racial- or bias-based profiling is strictly prohibited. However, nothing in this policy
is intended to prohibit an officer from considering factors such as race or ethnicity in
combination with other legitimate factors to establish reasonable suspicion or probable
cause (e.g., suspect description is limited to a specific race or group).

OTHER PROFILING PROHIBITED

402.3.1
The Spokane Police Department also condemns the illegal use of an individual or group's
attire, appearance or mode of transportation, including the fact that an individual rides a
motorcycle or wears motorcycle-related paraphernalia, as a factor in deciding to stop and
question, take enforcement action, arrest or search a person or vehicle, with or without a
legal basis under the United States Constitution or Washington State Constitution (RCW
43.101.410).

402.4 MEMBER RESPONSIBILITY
Every member of this department shall perform his/her duties in a fair and objective manner
and is responsible for promptly reporting any known instances of racial- or bias-based
profiling to a supervisor.

REASON FOR DETENTION

402.4.1
Officers detaining a person shall be prepared to articulate sufficient reasonable suspicion
to justify the detention, independent of the individual's membership in a protected class.

To the extent that written documentation would otherwise be completed (e.g., arrest report,
Field Interview card), the involved officer should include those facts giving rise to the officer's
reasonable suspicion or probable cause for the detention, as applicable.

Nothing in this policy shall require any officer to document a contact that would not otherwise
require reporting.

STATE REPORTING

402.6
Subject to any fiscal constraints, the Patrol Bureau Commander should review available
data related to traffic stops, including demographic data, existing procedures, practices and
training, as well as complaints. The data should be analyzed for any patterns or other
possible indicators of racial- or bias-based profiling and included in an annual report for the
Washington Association of Sheriffs and Chiefs of Police (RCW 43.101.410(3)).

ADMINISTRATION

402.7
Each year, the Patrol Bureau Commander shall review the efforts of the Department to
prevent racial- or bias-based profiling and submit an overview, including public concerns
and complaints, to the Chief of Police. This report should not contain any identifying
information regarding any specific complaint, citizen or officers. It should be reviewed by

Policy Manual

Crime and Disaster Scene Integrity

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

406.1
The protection and integrity of a crime scene is of the utmost importance for the successful
apprehension of criminals and successful prosecution. The integrity of a disaster scene
is equally as critical for the protection of life and property and investigation by proper
authorities.

CRIME SCENE RESPONSIBILITY

406.2
The first officer at the scene of a crime or major incident is generally responsible for
the preservation of the scene. Officers shall also consider officer safety and public
safety issues, including rendering medical aid to any injured parties. Once an officer has
assumed or been assigned to maintain the integrity of the crime/disaster scene, it shall be
maintained until the officer is relieved by a supervisor.

FIRST RESPONDER CONSIDERATIONS

406.2.1
The following list generally describes the first responder's function at a crime or disaster
scene. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive, is not necessarily in order and may be
altered according to the demands of each situation:

(a) Ensure no suspects are still in the area.

(b) Broadcast emergency information including all requests for additional assistance.

(c)

Provide first aid to injured parties if it can be done safely.

(d) Secure the inner perimeter with crime scene tape.

(e) Protect items of apparent evidentiary value.

(f)

Start a chronological log noting critical times and personnel allowed access.

406.2.2 MEDIA ACCESS
Authorized and bona fide members of the media shall be provided access to scenes of
disasters, criminal investigations, emergencies and other law enforcement activities subject
to the following conditions:

(a)

The media representative shall produce valid press credentials that shall be
prominently displayed at all times while in areas otherwise closed to the public.

(b) Media representatives may be prevented from interfering with emergency operations

and criminal investigations.

1.

In situations where media access would appear to interfere with emergency
operations and/or a criminal investigation. A reasonable effort should be made
to provide media representatives with access to a designated media area.

(c) No member of this department shall be subjected to media visits or interviews without

the consent of the involved employee.

(d) Media interviews with individuals who are in SPD custody shall not be permitted.

(e)

The scene of a tactical operation will be coordinated in the same manner as a crime
scene.

Policy Manual

Crime and Disaster Scene Integrity

TEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS

406.2.3
Crime and disaster scenes can sometimes attract news helicopters and other sightseeing
aircraft. Whenever such aircraft pose a threat to public safety due to congestion or when
the noise levels caused by loitering aircraft hamper incident operations, the field supervisor
should consider requesting Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR) through the Federal
Aviation Administration (Federal Aviation Regulations § 91.137). All requests for TFR
should be routed through the Combined Communications Center.

SEARCHES AT CRIME OR DISASTER SCENES

406.3
Officers arriving at crime or disaster scenes are often faced with the immediate need to
search for and render aid to victims and determine if suspects are present and continue to
pose a threat. Once officers are satisfied that no additional suspects are present and/or
there are no injured persons to be treated, those exigent circumstances will likely no longer
exist. Officers should thereafter secure the scene and conduct no further search until proper
authority for the search is obtained.

CONSENT

406.3.1
While consent to search should be obtained from authorized individuals where possible,
it is often more prudent to obtain a search warrant in the case of serious crimes or major
investigations.

CLEARANCE TO ENTER PROTECTED CRIME SCENE AREA
406.4
All employees, regardless of rank, shall obtain permission from the crime scene supervisor
before entering the crime scene area. This does not apply to employees assisting in an
emergency situation.

406.5

REPORT OF ACTIVITY REQUIRED

(a) Each member will report to the crime scene log officer the time they entered and/or

exited the crime scene.

(b) Each member shall make a report regarding his/her activities in the crime scene or

his/her participation in the investigation.

(c)

Each member responding to a major event controlled by a command post will make
a report detailing his/her activities.

command level officers with the decision making process regarding the management of
critical incidents. This form should be used by supervisors to evaluate the risk factors
associated with the incident in order to determine whether or not the activation of the
S.W.A.T. Team would be merely prudent or required. The S.W.A.T. Risk Analysis form is
available to all officers and can be accessed in the "forms" file within the "alphalist" folder
residing on the "H" drive.

Hazardous Material Response

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

412.1
Hazardous materials present a potential harm to employees resulting from their exposure.
To comply with RCW 70.105, WAC 173-303, and guidelines from the Washington State
Department of Ecology, the following is to be the policy of this department.

HAZARDOUS MATERIAL DEFINED

412.1.1
A hazardous material is a substance which by its nature, containment and reactivity, has
the capability of inflicting harm during exposure; characterized as being toxic, corrosive,
flammable, reactive, an irritant or strong sensitizer and thereby posing a threat to health
when improperly managed.

412.2 HAZARDOUS MATERIAL RESPONSE
Employees may encounter situations involving suspected hazardous materials, such as at
the scene of a traffic accident, chemical spill, or fire. When employees come into contact
with a suspected hazardous material, certain steps should be taken to protect themselves
and citizens.

The following steps should be considered at any scene involving suspected hazardous
materials:

(a) Notify the Spokane Fire Department (SFD). SFD will have overall command of HazMat

scenes.

(b) Establish a perimeter of sufficient distance from the incident to ensure the safety of

first responders and the general public.

(c)

Attempt to identify type of hazardous substance. (Identification can be determined by
placard, driver's manifest or statements from person transporting).

(d) Provide first-aid for injured parties if it can be done safely and without contamination.

(e) Begin evacuation of immediate area and surrounding areas dependent on substance.
Voluntary evacuation should be considered, however, depending on the substance,
mandatory evacuation will be in compliance with the Spokane City/County
Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan (CEMP) published by the Spokane
County Department of Emergency Management.

(f) Weather conditions such as wind speed and direction should be considered.

REPORTING EXPOSURE(S)

412.3
Department personnel who believe that they have been exposed to a hazardous material
shall immediately report the exposure to a supervisor. Each exposure shall be documented
by the employee in an employee exposure form that shall be forwarded via chain of
command to the commanding officer. Should the affected employee be unable to document
the exposure for any reason, it shall be the responsibility of the notified supervisor to
complete the memorandum.

Injury or illness caused or believed to be caused from exposure to hazardous materials shall
be reported the same as any other on-duty injury or illness in addition to a crime report or
incident report.

Hostages and Barricaded Suspects

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

414.1
Hostage situations and barricaded suspects present unique problems for agencies. The
protection of the public and law enforcement personnel is of the utmost importance. Proper
planning and training will tend to reduce the risks involved with these incidents.

DEFINITIONS

414.1.1
Hostage - A person held by one party in a conflict as security so that specified terms will
be met by the opposing party.

Barricaded Suspect - A person who takes a position of cover or concealment or maintains a
position in a structure and who resists capture by law enforcement personnel. A barricaded
suspect may be armed or suspected of being armed.

414.2 HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS
Promises of immunity or leniency and payment of ransom demands are rarely effective and
will generally not be offered to barricaded suspects. Trained hostage negotiators, however,
will be permitted to exercise flexibility in each situation based upon the circumstances
presented and consistent with their training in coordination with the Incident Commander.

Personnel involved in barricaded/hostage situations are urged to exercise patience and
extreme caution. The use of deadly force against any armed suspect will be governed by
Policy Manual § 300.

FIRST RESPONDER RESPONSIBILITY

414.3

Response to Bomb Calls

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

416.1
These guidelines have been prepared to assist officers in their initial response to incidents
involving explosives, explosive devices, or explosion/bombing incidents. Under no
circumstances should these guidelines be interpreted as compromising the safety of first
responders or the public. When confronted with an incident involving explosives, safety
shall always be the primary consideration.

FOUND EXPLOSIVES/SUSPECT DEVICES

416.2
When handling an incident involving a suspected explosive device, the following guidelines
shall be followed:

(a) No known or suspected explosive item should be considered safe regardless of its
size or apparent packaging. The bomb squad should be summoned for assistance.

(b) A minimum perimeter of 300 feet should be established around the location of the

device. An access point should be provided for support personnel.

(c)

As much information as is available should be promptly relayed to the Shift
Commander, without touching the device, including:

The stated threat.

Exact comments.

Time of discovery.

Exact location of the device.

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

(d)

The device should not be touched or moved except by qualified bomb squad
personnel.

(e) All equipment within 300 feet of the suspected device capable of producing radio
frequency energy should be turned off. This includes two-way radios, cell phones
and other personal communication devices.

(f)

Consideration should be given to evacuating any buildings near the device.

(g) A search of the area should be conducted for secondary devices or other objects that
are either hazardous or foreign to the area and a perimeter should be established
around any additional suspicious device found.

(h) Other hazardous devices such a commercial fireworks,

improvised fireworks,
containers of gunpowder and large caliber ammunition (.50 caliber and over) shall
be referred to the bomb squad for disposal.

EXPLOSION/BOMBING INCIDENTS

416.3
When an explosion has occurred, there are multitudes of considerations which may confront
the responding officers. As in other catastrophic incidents, a rapid response may help to
minimize injury to victims, contamination of the scene by gathering crowds or additional
damage by resulting fires or unstable structures. Whether the explosion was the result of
an accident or a criminal act, the responding officers should consider the following actions:

Secure the perimeter.

Secure the ingress/egress for fire and EMS.

Sweep for secondary devices.

Assess the scope of the incident, including the number of victims and extent of injuries.

Assist with first aid (Fire Department has primary responsibility).

Assist with evacuation of victims (Fire Department has primary responsibility).

Request additional resources needed.

Identify witnesses.

Preservation of evidence and possible crime scene.

Mental Illness Commitments

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

418.1
This procedure describes an officer's duties when a person is to be committed to a mental
health facility. The commitment of a person does not constitute an arrest.
If an officer
believes that a person falls within the provisions of RCW 71.05, he/she shall transport that
person to the designated facility for evaluation and commitment.

POLICY

418.1.1
It is the policy of this department to utilize on-duty and available Crisis Intervention Team
(CIT) members to be dispatched, respond to, and handle calls involving a suspected or
actual mentally disabled individual.

418.2 OFFICER CONSIDERATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Any officer responding to or handling a call involving a suspected or actual mentally disabled
individual or commitment should carefully consider the following (RCW 71.05.010):

(a)

That it is vitally important to safeguard the rights of mentally disabled individuals.

(b) Any available information which might assist in determining the cause and nature of

the mental illness or developmental disabilities.

(c) Conflict resolution and de-escalation techniques for potentially dangerous situations

involving mentally disabled persons.

(d) Appropriate language usage when interacting with mentally disabled persons.

presents a likelihood of serious harm; or is gravely disabled. In such cases, officers
may take the subject into custody only when:

1.

2.

3.

The mentally disabled person has been evaluated by a designated mental
health professional; and

Upon determining the need for detention, the mental health professional has
filed a petition for initial detention; and

The mental health professional has requested that the officer take the subject
into custody and have him or her placed in a treatment facility (RCW 71.05.150).

(b) An emergent detention is defined as one where, as the result of a mental disorder
a person presents an imminent likelihood of serious harm, or is in imminent danger
because of being gravely disabled. In such cases, officers may take the subject into
custody only under the following circumstances (RCW 71.05).

1.

At the written or oral request of a designated mental health professional who
has evaluated the subject and determined the need for an emergent detention,
or

2. When the officer has reasonable cause to believe that the person is in need of

emergent detention.

(c)

(d)

(e)

Emergent detentions based upon the written or oral request of a designated mental
health professional evaluation will be 72-hour holds. Emergent detentions based upon
the officer's reasonable cause will be 12-hour holds.

In all circumstances where a person is taken into custody on a mental health detention,
the officer shall also provide a verbal summary to an emergency department staff
member regarding the circumstances leading to the involuntary detention.

In general, any person involuntarily or voluntarily committed to an institution has the
right to counsel at all times. If a person suspected of a mental disorder makes it known
to the officer that he/she wishes to contact her/his attorney, the officer shall facilitate
those arrangements as soon as practicable.

TRANSPORTATION

418.2.2
When transporting any individual for a commitment, the handling officer should contact
the Combined Communications Center to determine which facility the patient should be
transported.

Officers may transport patients in the patrol unit and shall secure them in accordance
with the handcuffing policy. Time and mileage shall be given when transporting a person
under these circumstances. Violent patients or those that are medically unstable may
be restrained and transported by ambulance and ambulance personnel. The officer will
escort the patient into the facility and place that person in a designated treatment room as
directed by a staff member, and physically remain in the treatment room with the patient
until released by treatment staff.

RESTRAINTS

418.2.3
If the patient is violent or potentially violent, the officer will notify the staff of this concern.
The staff member in charge will have discretion as to whether soft-restraints will be used. If
these restraints are desired, the officer will wait while they are being applied to help provide
physical control of the patient, if needed.

SECURING OF WEAPONS

418.2.4
If a receiving and secured facility prohibits weapons or if an extraordinary event occurs in
the treatment facility and officers determine a need to secure their firearms, the firearm shall
be secured in the appropriate gun locker at the facility or in the police unit.

418.3

CRIMINAL CHARGES AND INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS

(a) When an officer has reasonable cause to believe that the individual has committed
acts constituting a non-felony crime that is not a serious offense, as identified in RCW
10.77.092, and the individual is known by history or consultation with the regional
support network to suffer from a mental disorder, the officer may, with the approval of
a supervisor (RCW 10.31):

1.

Take the individual to a crisis stabilization unit. Individuals delivered to a crisis
stabilization unit pursuant to this section may be held by the facility for a period
of up to 12 hours.

Refer the individual to a mental health professional for evaluation for initial
detention and proceeding under RCW Chapter 71.05.
Release the individual upon agreement to voluntary participation in outpatient
treatment.

(b)

(c)

In deciding whether to refer the individual to treatment under this section, the officer
shall be guided by standards mutually agreed upon with the county prosecutor's office.
Any agreement to participate in treatment shall not require individuals to stipulate to
any of the alleged facts regarding the criminal activity as a prerequisite to participation
in a mental health treatment alternative. The agreement is inadmissible in any criminal
or civil proceeding. The agreement does not create immunity from prosecution for the
alleged criminal activity.

(d) Officers are immune from liability for any good faith conduct under this section.
(e) When practical, any person charged with a crime, who also appears to suffer from
mental illness, shall be booked at the Spokane County Jail before being transported
to the authorized facility. If the person has injuries or some other medical condition,
he/she may be taken directly to the hospital with the approval of a supervisor.

CONFISCATION OF FIREARMS AND OTHER WEAPONS

418.4
Whenever a person has been detained or apprehended for examination and is found to own,
have in his/her possession or under his/her immediate control, any firearm whatsoever or
any other dangerous weapon, and the handling officer reasonably believes the weapon
represents a danger to the person or others if the person is released, the firearm or other
dangerous weapon should be taken into temporary custody for safekeeping. Any weapon
seized shall be booked into property pending disposition.

Officers are cautioned that a search warrant may be needed before entering a residence
to search unless lawful, warrantless entry has already been made (e.g., exigent
circumstances, valid consent).

Whenever the handling officer or the assigned detective has cause to believe that the
future return of any confiscated weapon might endanger the person or others, the officer
shall detail those facts and circumstances in a report and direct the property and evidence
technician to hold the weapons pending judicial review. The Investigative Services Bureau
shall, within five (5) days, prepare a petition to the Superior Court or District Court for an
order authorizing retention or other disposition of the weapons.

The handling officer shall further advise the person of the below described procedure for
the return of any firearm or other dangerous weapon which has been confiscated.

RETURN OF CONFISCATED FIREARMS AND WEAPONS (RCW 9.41.098)

418.4.1
Weapons taken into custody for safekeeping under section 418.4 will be returned to the
lawful owner upon request unless the seizing officer or the assigned detective has placed
a hold on the weapons pending a petition for retention, the petition has been granted, or is
pending before the court. Once the petition has been ruled on by the court, the weapons
will be released or disposed of in accordance with the court order.

Prior to releasing any weapon, Property and Evidence Facility personnel shall be required
to ensure the person is legally eligible to possess the weapon.

In the event that no timely petition is filed with the court or the court denies such a petition,
the seized weapon shall be eligible for release to the lawful owner or other authorized

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

420.1
Officers may use citation, a notice to appear or juvenile referral release procedures in
lieu of arrest for misdemeanor and gross misdemeanor offenses with certain exceptions.
The state courts have stated the intent to release all persons on misdemeanor and gross
misdemeanor citations, if qualified for such release.

420.2

RELEASE METHODS

(a) Release of adult violators by citation for misdemeanor and gross misdemeanor

offenses can be accomplished in two separate ways:

A field release is when the violator is released in the field without being
transported to a jail facility.

A jail release is when a violator is released after being transported to the jail and
booked.

(b) Release of juvenile violators for misdemeanor and gross misdemeanor offenses can

be accomplished in two separate ways:

A field release in which the case is handled by referral.

A jail release in which the juvenile is booked into the juvenile facility.

DISCRETION TO ARREST

420.2.1
While this department recognizes the statutory power of peace officers to make arrests
throughout the state, officers are encouraged to use sound discretion in the enforcement of
the law. On-duty arrests will not generally be made outside the jurisdiction of this department
except in cases of hot and/or fresh pursuit, while following up on crimes committed within
the City, or while assisting another agency. On-duty officers who discover criminal activity
outside the jurisdiction of the City should, when circumstances permit, consider contacting
the agency having primary jurisdiction before attempting an arrest.

Off-duty officers observing criminal activity should generally take enforcement action only
when it reasonably appears that imminent risk to life or property exists and the reasonable
opportunity does not exist to contact the law enforcement agency with primary jurisdiction.
In such situations the involved officer shall clearly identify him/herself as a Police officer.

Officers are authorized to use verbal warnings to resolve minor traffic and criminal violations
when appropriate.

An officer booking a suspect into jail shall notify a commissioned supervisor prior to the
booking, or as soon as practicable.

A supervisor may authorize an "exceptional booking": when he/she has determined that
immediate incarceration is necessary for public safety.

420.3
The following procedure will be followed to comply with state court rules.

FIELD RELEASE

420.3.1
Whenever a person is pursuant to statute for a violation of law which is punishable as a
misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor, the arresting officer or any other authorized peace
officer, may release the person in the field and serve upon the person a citation and Notice
to Appear in court (CrRLJ 2.1 (b)(2)).

JAIL RELEASE

420.3.2
In certain cases, it may be impractical to release a person arrested for misdemeanor
offenses in the field. With a supervisors approval the person arrested may instead be
booked into jail.

DISQUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES

420.3.3
In determining whether to release the person or to book him or her into jail, officers shall
consider the following factors (CrRLJ 2.1 (b)(2)):

(a) Whether the person has identified himself or herself satisfactorily.

(b) Whether detention appears reasonably necessary to prevent imminent bodily harm

to himself, herself, or another, or injury to property, or breach of the peace.

(c) Whether the person has ties to the community reasonably sufficient to assure his/her
appearance or whether there is substantial likelihood that he or she will refuse to
respond to the citation and notice.

(d) Whether the person previously has failed to appear in response to a citation and notice

issued pursuant to this rule or to other lawful process.

INSTRUCTIONS TO CITED PERSON

420.3.4
The citing officer shall, at the time he/she issues the defendant the notice to appear, call
attention to the time and place for appearance and take any other steps he/she deems
necessary to ensure that the defendant understands his/her written promise to appear.

JUVENILE REFERRAL AND BOOKING

420.4
Completion of criminal citations for juveniles is generally not appropriate with the following
exception:

•

Misdemeanor traffic violations of the RCW and SMC.

All other misdemeanor violations for juveniles shall be documented with a case number and
the case should be referred to Juvenile Court for further action including diversion.

If the juvenile is arrested for a felony, the juvenile may be booked into the juvenile facility.
However, a referral is also acceptable in these circumstances. In the case of a referral, the
officer shall release the juvenile to a parent or legal guardian. When considering whether to
book the juvenile or handle by referral, the officer should consider the following, in addition
to factors listed in 420.3.3, as reasonable circumstances in which to book the juvenile:

•

•

•

the gravity of the offense

the past record of the offender

the age of the offender

Arrest or Detention of Foreign Nationals

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

422.1
Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, sets forth certain rights of
foreign nationals from member countries when arrested, detained or imprisoned by law
enforcement officials in this country. This section provides direction to officers when
considering a physical arrest or detention of a foreign national. All foreign service personnel
shall be treated with respect and courtesy, regardless of the level of established immunity.
As noted herein, the United States is a party to several bilateral agreements that obligate
our authorities to notify the consulate upon the person's detention, regardless of whether
the detained person(s) request that his/her consulate be notified. The list of specific
countries that the United States is obligated to notify is listed in the U.S. Department of
State website.

DEFINITIONS

422.1.1
Foreign National - Anyone who is not a citizen of the United States (U.S.). A person with
dual-citizenship, U.S. and foreign, is not a foreign national.

Immunity - Refers to various protections and privileges extended to the employees of
foreign governments who are present in the U.S. as official representatives of their home
governments. These privileges are embodied in international
law and are intended to
ensure the efficient and effective performance of their official  missions  (i.e., embassies,
consulates, etc.) in foreign countries. Proper respect for the immunity to which an individual
is entitled is necessary to ensure that U.S. diplomatic relations are not jeopardized and to
maintain reciprocal treatment of U.S. personnel abroad. Although immunity may preclude
U.S. courts from exercising jurisdiction, it is not intended to excuse unlawful activity. It is
the policy of the U.S. Department of State's Office of Foreign Missions (OFM) that illegal
acts by Foreign Service personnel should always be pursued through proper channels.
Additionally, the host country's right to protect its citizens supersedes immunity privileges.
Peace officers may intervene to the extent necessary to prevent the endangerment of
public safety or the commission of a serious crime, regardless of immunity claims.

ARREST OR DETENTION OF FOREIGN NATIONALS

422.2
Officers should take appropriate enforcement action for all violations observed, regardless
of claims of diplomatic or consular immunity received from violators. A person shall not,
however, be subjected to in-custody arrest when diplomatic or consular immunity is claimed
by the individual or suspected by the officer, and the officer has verified or reasonably
suspects that the claim of immunity is valid.

LEVELS OF IMMUNITY

422.3
The specific degree of immunity afforded to foreign service personnel within the U.S. is
directly related to their function and position in this country.

DIPLOMATIC AGENTS

422.3.1
Diplomatic agents (e.g., ambassadors and United Nations representatives) are afforded the
highest levels of immunity. They are exempt from arrest or detention and are immune from
all criminal (and most civil) prosecution by the host state. The family members of diplomatic

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Arrest or Detention of Foreign Nationals

agents enjoy these same immunities. Currently there are no diplomatic agents permanently
assigned to Washington; but they do occasionally visit the state.

CONSULAR OFFICERS

422.3.2
Consular officers are the ranking members of consular posts who perform various formal
functions on behalf of their own governments. Typical titles include consul general, consul,
and vice consul. These officials are immune from arrest or detention, except pursuant to a
felony warrant. They are only immune from criminal and civil prosecution arising from official
acts. Official acts immunity must be raised as an affirmative defense in the court jurisdiction,
and its validity is determined by the court. Under this defense, the prohibited act itself must
have been performed as an official function. It is not sufficient that the consular agent was
on-duty or in an official capacity at the time of the violation. The family members of consular
officers generally enjoy no immunity, however, any family member who enjoys a higher level
of immunity is issued an identification card by Department of State (DOS) enumerating any
privileges or immunities on the back of the card. Examples are consular officers and family
members from Russia or China.

There are approximately 40 consular officers in Washington, with most located in Seattle
and Spokane.

HONORARY CONSULS

422.3.3
Honorary consuls are part-time employees of the country they represent and are either
permanent residents of the U.S. or U.S. nationals (unlike career consular officers, who are
foreign nationals on temporary assignment to the U.S.). Honorary consuls may be arrested
and detained; limited immunity for official acts may be available as a subsequent defense.
Family members have no immunity.

IDENTIFICATION

422.4
All diplomatic and consular personnel who are entitled to immunity are registered with
the Department of State and are issued distinctive identification cards by the Department
of State Protocol Office. These cards are the best means of identifying Foreign Service
personnel. They include a photograph, identifying information, and, on the reverse side, a
brief description of the bearer's immunity status. Unfortunately, these identification cards
are not always promptly issued by the Department of State. In addition to the Department
of State identification card, Foreign Service personnel should also have a driver license
issued by the Department of State Diplomatic Motor Vehicle Office (DMVO), which in most
circumstances replaces the operator's license issued by the state.

VEHICLE REGISTRATION

422.4.1
Vehicles that are owned by foreign missions or Foreign Service personnel and their
dependents are registered with the Department of State OFM and display distinctive red,
white, and blue license plates. Vehicles assigned to diplomatic or consular officers will
generally have license plates labels with the words "Diplomat" or "Consul." Vehicles owned
by honorary consuls are not issued OFM license plates; but may have Washington license
plates with an "honorary consul" label. Driver's identity or immunity status should not be
presumed from the type of license plates displayed on the vehicle. The status of an OFM
license plate should be run via the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System
(NLETS), designating "US" as the state, if the officer has reason to question the legitimate
possession of the license plate.

The following procedures provide a guideline for handling enforcement of foreign nationals:

ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES

CITABLE OFFENSES

422.5.1
An enforcement document shall be issued at the scene for all violations warranting such
action, regardless of the violator's immunity status. The issuance of a citation is not
considered an arrest or detention under current Department of State guidelines. Whenever
the equivalent of a notice to appear is issued to an immunity claimant, the following
additional procedures shall be followed by the arresting officer:

(a)

(b)

Identification documents are to be requested of the claimant.

The title and country represented by the claimant are to be recorded on the back of
the officer's copy of the Notice to Appear for later reference. Do not include on the
face of the notice to appear.

(c)

The identity and immunity status of the individual shall be conclusively established.

(d) Verified diplomatic agents and consular officers, including staff and family members
from countries with which the U.S. has special agreements, are not required to sign
the Notice to Appear. The word  Refused  shall be entered in the signature box, and
the violator shall be released.

(e) Verified consular staff members, excluding those from countries with which the U.S.
has special agreements, are generally obligated to sign the Notice to Appear, but a
signature shall not be required if their immunity status is uncertain.

(f)

All other claimants are subject to the provisions of the policy and procedures outlined
in this chapter.

(g)

The violator shall be provided with the appropriate copy of the notice to appear.

IN-CUSTODY ARRESTS

422.5.2
Diplomatic agents and consular officers are immune from arrest or detention (unless
they have no identification and the detention is to verify their diplomatic status). Proper
identification of
in-custody situations.
Claimants who are not entitled to immunity shall be placed in custody in accordance with
the provisions outlined in Policy Manual § 422.7.

A subject who is placed under arrest and claims diplomatic or consular immunity shall not
be physically restrained before verification of the claim (unless restraint is necessary for the
protection of the officer or others.)

A supervisor shall be promptly notified and should respond to the scene when possible.

Field verification of the claimant's identity is to be attempted as follows:

(a)

Identification cards issued by the Department of State, Protocol Office, are the only
valid evidence of diplomatic or consular immunity. The following types of identification
cards are issued: Diplomatic (blue bordered), Consular (red bordered), and Official

Initiate telephone verification with the Department of State. Newly arrived members of
diplomatic or consular missions may not yet have official Department of State identity
documents. Verify immunity by telephone with the Department of State any time an
individual claims immunity and cannot present satisfactory identification, the officer
has reason to doubt the claim of immunity, or there is a possibility of physical arrest.

Subjects verified through the above procedures as being officials entitled to immunity
(diplomatic agent, consular officers and consular staff and family members from countries
with which the U.S. has special agreements) may not be arrested. The procedures below
shall be followed. These procedures should also be used in the event immunity cannot be
verified, but another form of identification indicates that immunity is probable.

If the release of the violator will not create an additional hazard, adequate information
to properly identify the violator shall be obtained then the official shall be released. A
supervisor's approval for the release shall be obtained whenever possible. The necessary
release documents and/or a Certificate of Release form should only be issued under the
proper conditions.

If the violator appears to have been driving while under the influence, field sobriety tests,
including Preliminary Alcohol Screening (PAS) device tests and chemical tests should be
offered and obtained whenever possible, however, these tests cannot be compelled. The
subject shall not be permitted to drive. A supervisor's approval for release shall be obtained
whenever possible and alternative transportation should be arranged.

All facts of the incident shall be documented in accordance with this policy in a Driving
Under the Influence (DUI) Arrest-Investigation Report, Arrest-Investigation Report and/or
any other relevant Report form. Notwithstanding the field release of the subject, prosecution
is still appropriate and should be pursued by the command concerned. The Department of

prosecution is not undertaken by the agency.

TRAFFIC COLLISIONS

422.6
Persons involved in traffic collisions who possess a Department of State OFM Diplomatic
Driver License, issued by the DMVO, shall have the collision report coded as required. If
subsequent prosecution of the claimant is anticipated, the claimant's title, country, and type
of identification presented should be recorded for future reference. Issuance of a citation to,
or arrest of, an immunity claimant at the accident scene should be handled in accordance
with the procedures specified in Policy Manual § 422.5 of this chapter.

VEHICLES

422.6.1
Vehicles, which are owned by subjects with full immunity, may not be searched, stored,
or impounded without the owner's permission. (Such permission may be assumed if the
vehicle has been stolen.) These vehicles may, however, be towed the necessary distance
to remove them from obstructing traffic or creating any other hazard.

REPORTS

422.6.2
A photocopy of each traffic collision report involving an identified diplomat and/or immunity
claimant shall be forwarded to the office of the Chief of Police within 48 hours whether or
not the claim is verified. The words  Immunity Claim  shall be marked on the photocopy,
together with a notation of the claimant's title, country, and type of identification presented (if
applicable). In addition to the report, a follow-up cover memorandum should be submitted
if the violation was flagrant, if the claimant was uncooperative, or if there were any other
unusual aspects of the enforcement contact that should be reported to the Department of
State for further action. The Shift Commander/Supervisor apprised of the incident/accident
shall also send a copy of all documents and reports submitted by the investigating officer
along with any supervisor's notes, materials and/or logs to the Chief of Police's office within
48 hours of the incident. The Chief of Police's office will check to ensure that notification of
Department of State and all necessary follow-up occur.

422.7
FOREIGN NATIONALS WHO DO NOT CLAIM IMMUNITY
These policies and procedures apply to foreign nationals who do not claim diplomatic or
consular immunity.

Officers shall arrest foreign nationals only under the following circumstances:

(a)

(b)

There is a valid warrant issued for the person's arrest.

There is probable cause to believe that the foreign national has violated a federal
criminal law, a state law, or a local ordinance.

(c) Officers shall not arrest foreign nationals solely for alleged undocumented entry into
the U.S. unless the undocumented entry is committed in the officer's presence.

After a lawful detention or criminal arrest, officers may detain foreign nationals solely
for alleged undocumented presence in the U.S. if the U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) is contacted and can respond to take custody within a reasonable time.
Officers shall not arrest foreign nationals for undocumented presence. Federal courts have
consistently held that undocumented presence is not a crime but a federal civil violation
only enforceable by federal officers.

•

Officers shall not stop or detain persons solely for determining immigration status.

International treaty obligations provide for notification of foreign governments when
foreign nationals are arrested or otherwise detained in the U.S.

Whenever an officer arrests and incarcerates a foreign national or detains a foreign
national for investigation for over two hours, the officer shall promptly advise the
individual that he/she is entitled to have his/her government notified of the arrest or
detention. If the individual wants his/her government notified, the officer shall begin
the notification process.

ARREST PROCEDURE

422.7.1
Whenever an officer physically arrests or detains an individual for criminal investigation and
the officer reasonably believes the person to be a foreign national, the officer shall inquire
to determine the person's citizenship.

This procedure applies to detentions of more than two hours. An inquiry is not required if
the individual is detained less than two hours for criminal investigation.

Officers shall provide Combined Communications Center with the following information
concerning the individual:

Full name of individual, including paternal and maternal surname if used.

Country of citizenship.

Date of birth or age.

Current residence.

Time, date, place, location of incarceration/detention, and the 24-hour telephone
number of the place of detention if different from the Department itself.

If the individual claims citizenship of one of the countries for which notification of the
consulate/embassy is mandatory, officers shall provide Combined Communications Center
with the information above as soon as practicable, regardless of whether the individual
desires that the embassy/consulate be notified. This procedure is critical because of treaty
obligations with the particular countries. The list of countries and jurisdictions that require
notification can be found on the U.S. Department of State website.

DOCUMENTATION

422.7.2
Officers shall document in the appropriate Arrest-Investigation Report, the date and time the
Combined Communications Center was notified of the foreign national's arrest/detention
and his/her claimed nationality, and will note the name of the person contacted at the
embassy/consulate.

Rapid Response And Deployment Policy

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

424.1
Violence in schools, workplaces and other locations by any individual or group of individuals
presents a difficult situation for law enforcement. The purpose of this policy is to identify
guidelines and factors that will assist responding officers as they make decisions in these
rapidly unfolding and tense situations.

The policy of this department in dealing with the crisis situation shall be:

POLICY

(a)

To attempt, by every means available, to attain any tactical advantage over the
responsible individual(s).

To attempt, whenever feasible, a negotiated surrender of the suspect(s) and release
of the hostages through the expertise of the members of this department and others.

(e) When an emergency situation exists, neutralize the threat as rapidly as reasonably

possible to minimize injury and loss of life.

Nothing in this policy shall preclude the use of necessary force, deadly or otherwise, by
members of this department in protecting themselves or others from death or serious injury.

PROCEDURE

424.3
If there is a reasonable belief that acts or threats by a suspect are placing lives in imminent
danger, first responding officers should consider reasonable options to immediately
eliminate the threat. Officers must decide, often under a multitude of difficult and rapidly
evolving circumstances, whether to advance on the suspect, take other actions to deal
with the threat or wait for additional resources.

When deciding on a course of action officers should consider:

(a) Whether sufficient personnel are available on-scene to advance on the suspect. Any
advance on a suspect should be made using teams of two or more officers whenever
reasonably possible.

(b) Whether individuals who are under imminent threat can be moved out of danger with

reasonable safety.

(c) Whether the officers have the ability to effectively communicate with others in the field.

(d) Whether planned tactics can be effectively deployed.

(e)

(f)

The availability of rifles, shotguns, shields, control devices and any other appropriate
tools, and whether the deployment of these tools will provide a tactical advantage.

In a case of a barricaded suspect with no hostages and no immediate threat to others,
officers should consider summoning and waiting for additional assistance (special
tactics and/or hostage negotiation team response).

equal enforcement of the law and equal service to the public regardless of immigration
status. Confidence in this commitment will increase the effectiveness of the Department in
protecting and serving the entire community.

DEPARTMENT POLICY
428.2
The U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has primary jurisdiction for
enforcement of the provisions of Title 8, United States Code (U.S.C.) dealing with illegal
entry. When assisting ICE at its specific request, or when suspected criminal violations
are discovered as a result of inquiry or investigation based on probable cause originating
from activities other than the isolated violations of Title 8, U.S.C., §§ 1304, 1324, 1325 and
1326, this department may assist in the enforcement of federal immigration laws.

PROCEDURES FOR IMMIGRATION COMPLAINTS

428.3
Persons wishing to report immigration violations should be referred to the local office of the
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The Employer Sanction Unit of ICE has
primary jurisdiction for enforcement of Title 8, U.S.C.

When enforcement efforts are increased in a particular area, equal consideration should be
given to all suspected violations and not just those affecting a particular race, ethnicity, age,

The disposition of each contact (e.g., warning, citation, arrest), while discretionary in
each case, should not be affected by such factors as race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual
orientation, religion or socioeconomic status.

ICE REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE

428.3.3
If a specific request is made by ICE or any other federal agency, this department will provide
available support services, such as traffic control or peacekeeping efforts, during the federal
operation.

Members of this department should not participate in such federal operations as part of any
detention team unless it is in direct response to a request for assistance on a temporary
basis or for officer safety. Any detention by a member of this department should be based
upon the reasonable belief that an individual is involved in criminal activity.

decision to arrest shall be based upon those factors which establish probable cause and
not on arbitrary aspects. Race, ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and
socioeconomic status alone are of no bearing on the decision to arrest.

All individuals, regardless of their immigration status, must feel secure that contacting law
enforcement will not make them vulnerable to deportation. Members should not attempt to
determine the immigration status of crime victims and witnesses or take enforcement action
against them absent exigent circumstances or reasonable cause to believe that a crime
victim or witness is involved in violating criminal laws. Generally, if an officer suspects that
a victim or witness is an undocumented immigrant, the officer need not report the person
to ICE unless circumstances indicate such reporting is reasonably necessary.

Nothing in this policy is intended to restrict officers from exchanging legitimate law
enforcement information with any other federal, state or local government entity (Title 8
U.S.C. §1373 and 8 U.S.C. § 1644).

Under certain circumstances,
law allows temporary immigration benefits to
victims and witnesses of certain qualifying crimes (8 USC § 1101(a)(15)(U and T)). A
declaration/certification for a U-Visa/T-Visa from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
Services must be completed on the appropriate U.S. Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) Form I-918 or I-914 by law enforcement and must include information on how the
individual can assist in a criminal investigation or prosecution in order for a U-Visa/T-Visa
to be issued.

Any request for assistance in applying for U-Visa/T-Visa status should be forwarded in a
timely manner to the Investigation Bureau sergeant assigned to supervise the handling of
any related case. The Investigation Bureau sergeant should do the following:

(a) Consult with the assigned detective to determine the current status of any related

case and whether further documentation is warranted.

(b) Review the instructions for completing the declaration/certification if necessary.
Instructions for completing Forms I-918/I-914 can be found on the U.S. DHS web

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

430.1
The City Public Works Department has personnel available to handle emergency calls
24 hours per day. Calls for service during non-business hours are frequently directed to
the police department. Requests for such service received by this department should be
handled in the following manner.

BROKEN WATER LINES

430.1.1
The city's responsibility ends at the water meter; any break or malfunction in the water
system from the water meter to the citizen's residence or business is the customer's
responsibility. Public Works can only turn off the valve at the meter. The citizen can
normally accomplish this.

If a break occurs on the city side of the meter, emergency personnel should be called as
soon as practical by Combined Communications Center.

ELECTRICAL LINES

430.1.2
City Public Works does not maintain electrical lines to street light poles. When a power
line poses a hazard, an officer should be dispatched to protect against personal injury or
property damage that might be caused by power lines. Avista should be promptly notified,
as appropriate.

RESERVOIRS, PUMPS, WELLS, ETC.

430.1.3
Public Works maintains the reservoirs and public water equipment, as well as several
underpass and other street drainage pumps.
In the event of flooding or equipment
malfunctions, emergency personnel should be contacted as soon as possible.

Officers should treat an aircraft crash site as a crime scene until it is determined that such
is not the case. If a military aircraft is involved, additional dangers, such as live ordnance
or hazardous materials, may be present. The scene may require additional security due to
the potential presence of confidential equipment or information.

The duties of the field officer at the scene of an aircraft accident include the following:

(a) Determine the nature and extent of the accident.

(b) Request additional personnel and other resources to respond as needed.

(c)

or protecting the public from danger.
If possible, the investigating authority should first
be consulted before entering or moving any aircraft or any crash debris. Photographs or
sketches of the original positions should be made whenever feasible.

The fire department will be responsible for control of the accident scene until the injured
parties are cared for and the accident scene has been rendered safe for containment.
Thereafter, police personnel will be responsible for preserving the scene until relieved by
the investigating authority.

Once the scene is relinquished to the investigating authority, personnel from this agency
may assist in containment of the scene until the investigation is completed or assistance is
no longer needed.

An airport service worker or the airport manager may respond to the scene to assist the
on-scene commander with technical expertise, should it be needed during the operation.

in which it was found until such time as NTSB or other authorized personnel arrive to take
charge of the scene.

Military personnel will respond to take charge of any military aircraft involved, whether or
not injuries or deaths have occurred.

If the accident did not result in a death or injury and the NTSB elects not to respond, the
pilot or owner may assume control of the aircraft.

Removal of the wreckage shall be done under the guidance of the NTSB or military
authorities or, if the NTSB is not responding for an on-site investigation, at the discretion
of the pilot or the owner.

434.2.3
COMBINED COMMUNICATIONS CENTER RESPONSIBILITIES
Dispatchers are responsible to make notifications as directed once an aircraft accident has
been reported. The notifications will vary depending on the type of accident, extent of
injuries or damage, and the type of aircraft involved. Generally, the dispatcher will need to
notify the following agencies or individuals when an aircraft accident has occurred.

(a)

(b)

Fire Department.

The affected airport tower.

(c) Closest military base if a military aircraft is involved.

(d) Ambulances or other assistance as required.

(e) Notify area hospitals of the potential for an influx of injured patients (if appropriate).

(f)

Ensure the FAA and NTSB have been notified.

When an aircraft accident is reported to the Spokane Police Department by the airport tower
personnel the dispatcher receiving such information should verify that the tower personnel
will contact the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Standards District Office and
the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). In the event that airport personnel are
not involved, the dispatcher should notify the FAA and the NTSB.

Detentions and Photographing
Detainees

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

440.1
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for conducting field interviews (FI),
pat-down frisks, and the taking and retention of photographs of persons detained in the
field but not arrested. Due to a variety of situations confronting the officer, the decision to
FI or photograph a field detainee shall be left to the discretion of the involved officer based
on the totality of the circumstances available to them at the time of the detention.

DEFINITIONS

440.2
Detention - Occurs when an officer intentionally, through words, actions or physical force
causes an individual to reasonably believe he/she is being required to restrict his/her
movement. Detentions also occur when an officer actually restrains a person's freedom
of movement.

Consensual Encounter - Occurs when an officer contacts an individual but does not create
a detention through words, actions or other means. In other words, a reasonable individual
would believe that his/her contact with the officer is voluntary.

Field Interview (FI) - The brief detainment of an individual, whether on foot or in a vehicle,
based on reasonable suspicion for the purposes of determining the individual's identity and
resolving the officer's suspicions.

Field Photographs - Field photographs are defined as posed photographs taken of
a person during a contact, detention, or arrest in the field. Undercover surveillance
photographs of an individual and recordings captured by the normal operation of a Mobile
Audio Video (MAV) system when persons are not posed for the purpose of photographing
are not considered field photographs.

Frisk - This type of search is used by officers in the field to check an individual for weapons.
It involves a thorough patting down of clothing to locate any weapons or dangerous items
that could pose a danger to the officer, the detainee, or others.

Reasonable Suspicion - Occurs when, under the totality of the circumstances, an officer
has articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot and a particular person is connected
with that possible criminal activity.

FIELD INTERVIEWS

440.3
Officers may stop individuals for the purpose of conducting an FI where reasonable
suspicion is present.
In justifying the stop, the officer should be able to point to specific
facts which, when taken together with rational inferences, reasonably warrant the stop.
Such facts include, but are not limited to, the following:

(a)

(b)

(c)

The appearance or demeanor of an individual suggests that he/she is part of a
criminal enterprise or is engaged in a criminal act.

The actions of the suspect suggest that he/she is engaged in a criminal activity.

The hour of day or night is inappropriate for the suspect's presence in the area.

(d)

(e)

(f)

(g)

(h)

The suspect's presence in the particular area is suspicious.

The suspect is carrying a suspicious object.

The suspect's clothing bulges in a manner that suggests he/she is carrying a
weapon.

The suspect is located in proximate time and place to an alleged crime.

The officer has knowledge of the suspect's prior criminal record or involvement
in criminal activity.

INITIATING A FIELD INTERVIEW

440.3.1
An officer may initiate the stop of a person when there is articulable, reasonable suspicion
to do so. A person, however, should not be detained longer than is reasonably necessary
to resolve the officer's suspicions.

Nothing in this policy is intended to discourage consensual contacts. Frequent and
random casual contacts with consenting individuals are encouraged by the Spokane
Police Department to strengthen our community involvement, community awareness and
problem identification.

440.3.2 WITNESS IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVIEWS
Because potential witnesses to an incident may be lost or the integrity of their statements
compromised with the passage of time, officers should, when warranted by the seriousness
of the case, take reasonable steps to promptly coordinate with an on-scene supervisor
and/or criminal investigators to utilize available personnel for the following:

(a)

Identify all persons present at the scene and in the immediate area.

1. When feasible, a statement should be obtained from those persons who claim
not to have witnessed the incident but who were present at the time it occurred.
Officers should seek consent to record such statements whenever possible.

Any potential witness who is unwilling or unable to remain available for a formal
interview should not be detained absent reasonable suspicion to detain or
probable cause to arrest. Without detaining the individual for the sole purpose
of identification, officers should attempt to identify the witness prior to his/her
departure.

(b) Witnesses who are willing to provide a formal interview should be asked to meet
at a suitable location where criminal investigators may obtain a statement. Such
witnesses, if willing, may be transported by department personnel.

A written, verbal or recorded statement of consent should be obtained prior to
transporting a witness in a department vehicle. When the witness is a minor,
consent should be obtained from the parent or guardian, if available, prior to
transportation.

PAT-DOWN SEARCHES

440.4
A pat-down search of a detained subject may be conducted whenever an officer reasonably
believes that the person may possess an object that can be utilized as an offensive weapon
or whenever the officer has a reasonable fear for his/her own safety or the safety of others.
Circumstances that may establish justification for performing a pat-down search include,
but are not limited to the following:

(g)

The age and gender of the suspect.

Whenever possible, pat-down searches should be performed by officers of the same
gender.

FIELD PHOTOGRAPHS

440.5
When collecting photographic evidence, corporals shall not photograph the intimate areas
of persons of the opposite gender.
Intimate areas shall mean the breasts, buttocks and
genitals.

If a photograph of any person's intimate area is necessary for evidentiary purposes,
corporals may utilize another officer who is of the same gender as the person being
photographed.
If a same gender officer is not available, the corporal may use medical
personnel, preferably of the same gender. If the person who is to be photographed objects
to the medical personnel taking the photographs, the forensics unit will be called out to do
so.

Corporals should give direction to the officer or medical personnel taking the photographs
on the operation of the camera, the specific evidentiary need for the photograph, and the
area(s) to be photographed. Corporals should review the photographs (not in the presence
of the person the pictures were taken of) to ensure that the evidentiary need has been met.

Before photographing any field detainee, the officer shall carefully consider, among other
things, the factors listed below.

FIELD PHOTOS TAKEN WITH CONSENT

440.5.1
Field photographs may be taken when the subject of the photograph knowingly and
the officer should
voluntarily gives consent. When taking a consensual photograph,
document in a report or FI that the individual consented to a posed photograph(s).

FIELD PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN WITHOUT CONSENT

440.5.2
Field photographs may be taken without consent only if they are taken during a detention
that is based on reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, and the photograph serves a
legitimate law enforcement purpose related to the detention. Mere knowledge or suspicion
of gang membership or affiliation is not a sufficient justification for taking a photograph
without consent. The officer must be able to articulate facts that reasonably indicate that
the subject was involved in or was about to become involved in criminal conduct.

If, prior to taking a photograph, the officer's reasonable suspicion of criminal activity has
been dispelled, the detention must cease and the photograph should not be taken.

(b) Criteria For Gang Member Database Submission: A subject can be entered into the
Spokane Regional GangNet database when two or more of the following criteria are
found through investigation, coupled with the officers' training and expertise. The only
single-criteria approved for entry is an in-custody jail classification interview:

Subject has admitted to being a gang member.

Subject has been arrested with known gang members for offenses consistent
with gang activity.

Subject has been identified as a gang member by a reliable informant/source.

Subject has been identified as a gang member by an untested informant.

Subject has been seen affiliating with documented gang members either in
person or photos. A photo alone cannot justify these criteria. The Training and
experience of the officer will be relied on in determining the context of the photo.

Subject has been seen displaying gang symbols and/or hand signs.

Subject has been seen frequenting gang areas.

Subject has been seen wearing gang-specific attire.

Subject
modifications. Knowledge of these body markings must be documented.

is known to have gang-specific tattoos or gang-specific body

interview. *(All others require two criteria). The Spokane Police Department
shall maintain source documentation, which adequately supports each entry.

(c) Criteria For Gang Associate Database Submission: The associate information is
entered into the Spokane Regional GangNet database for the purpose of providing
further identification,
through an established relationship, of an existing gang
member. There are two mandatory separate submission criteria established for
entry of associates into a gang member's record. The following two criteria must be
present:

The individual is known to associate with active gang members.

The law enforcement or criminal justice officer has established a reasonable
suspicion the individual is involved in criminal activity or enterprise. The officer's
belief must be premised upon reasoning and logic coupled with sound judgment
based upon law enforcement experience and training rather than mere hunch or
whim. The Spokane Police Department shall maintain source documentation,
which adequately supports each entry.

(d) An individual may be designated as a gang associate only when the individual is
known to associate with active criminal gang members and an officer has established
that there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is involved in criminal activity.
An officer's belief must be premised upon reasoning and logic coupled with sound
judgment based upon law enforcement experience, rather than a mere hunch or whim.

Medical Marijuana

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

452.1
The purpose of this policy is to provide members of this department with guidelines for
handling and distinguishing between claims of medical marijuana use under Washington's
Medical Use of Cannabis Act and criminal controlled substance violations (RCW 69.51A).

452.1.1
Definitions related to this policy include (RCW 69.51A.010):

DEFINITIONS

Designated provider - A person who is 18 years of age or older, who has been designated
in writing by a patient to serve as a designated provider. An individual can act as a
designated provider to no more than one patient at a time and is prohibited from consuming
marijuana obtained for the use of the patient.

Medical use of marijuana - The production, possession, or administration of marijuana, as
defined in RCW 69.50.101(q), for the exclusive benefit of a qualifying patient in the treatment
of his/her terminal or debilitating medical condition.

Qualifying patient - Any person who meets all of the following criteria:

Has been diagnosed by his/her health care professional as having a terminal or a
debilitating medical condition.

Is a resident of the state of Washington at the time of such diagnosis.

Has been advised by his/her health care professional about the risks and benefits of

POLICY

452.2
It is the policy of the Spokane Police Department to prioritize resources to avoid making
arrests related to marijuana that the arresting officer reasonably believes would not be
prosecuted by state or federal authorities.

Washington medical marijuana laws are intended to provide protection from prosecution
for those who use, possess, deliver or produce marijuana to mitigate the symptoms of
certain debilitating or terminal medical conditions. However, Washington medical marijuana
laws do not affect federal laws and there is no medical exception under federal law for the
possession or distribution of marijuana.

Officers should exercise discretion to ensure laws are appropriately enforced without
unreasonably burdening both the individuals protected under Washington law and the
resources of the Department.

INVESTIGATION

452.3
Investigations involving the possession, delivery or production of marijuana generally fall
into one of several categories:
(a) No medicinal claim is made.
(b) A medicinal claim is made by a qualifying patient or designated provider who is in

(c)

possession of amounts within the limits (designated by RCW 69.51A.040).
A medicinal claim is made by a qualifying patient or designated provider who is in
possession of amounts exceeding the limits designated by RCW 69.51A.040 or who
presented no valid documentation when initially contacted.

INVESTIGATIONS WITH NO MEDICINAL CLAIM

452.3.1
In any investigation involving the possession, delivery or production of marijuana where
there is no claim that the marijuana is for medicinal purposes, the officer should proceed
with reasonable enforcement action. A medicinal defense may be raised at any time, so
officers should document any statements and observations that may be relevant to whether
the marijuana is possessed or produced for medicinal purposes.

452.3.2 MEDICAL CLAIMS BY QUALIFYING PATIENTS OR DESIGNATED
PROVIDERS
A qualifying patient or designated provider with valid documentation should not be arrested
if he/she possesses no more than 15 cannabis plants and (RCW 69.51A.040; RCW
69.51A.043):
(a)
(b) No more cannabis product than what could reasonably be produced with no more

24 ounces of usable cannabis, or

(c)

than 24 ounces of usable cannabis, or
A combination of usable cannabis and cannabis product that does not exceed a
combined total representing possession and processing of no more than 24 ounces
of usable cannabis.

If a person is both a qualifying patient and a designated provider for another, he/she may
possess no more than double the amounts described above (RCW 69.51A.040(1)(b)).

Officers may take enforcement action against a designated caregiver even when the
above thresholds are not exceeded if there is evidence that the provider has converted the
marijuana for his/her personal use or benefit or has provided for more than one patient
within a 15-day period (RCW 69.51A.040).

Officers may take enforcement action against a qualifying patient even when the above
thresholds are not exceeded if there is evidence that the patient possesses or uses the
marijuana for his/her personal, non-medical use or benefit (RCW 69.51A.040).

EXCESS AMOUNTS OR NO VALID DOCUMENTATION

452.3.3
A qualifying patient or designated provider may raise an affirmative defense to charges that
the amount of marijuana in his/her possession exceeds the amount legally allowed by RCW
69.51A.040 or that he/she presented no valid documentation when initially contacted by law
enforcement (RCW 69.51A.045; RCW 69.51A.047).

Officers should conduct a thorough investigation in such cases, but in general, should not
arrest a subject for possession, delivery or production of marijuana if an excess amount
appears reasonable based upon the above policy considerations. Similarly, if an officer
can verify that valid documentation exists, even though it was not presented by a qualified
patient or designated caregiver, an arrest generally should not be made.

All facts should be thoroughly documented and if evidence is not seized,
photographed and detailed in the report.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

452.3.4
Prior to making a physical arrest or confiscating cannabis plants, usable cannabis or
product, officers should consider the following:

(a) Whenever the initial investigation reveals an amount greater than specified by law,
officers should, in anticipation of an affirmative defense, consider and document:

The medical condition itself.

The quality of the marijuana (chemical content).

The method of ingestion (e.g. smoking, eating, nebulizer).

The timing of the possession in relation to a harvest (patient may be storing
marijuana).

5. Whether the marijuana is being cultivated indoors or outdoors, and the climate.

(b) Before proceeding with enforcement related to collective gardens, officers should

consider conferring with appropriate legal counsel.

(c)

Investigations regarding collective gardens should consider pertinent City ordinances
and that (RCW 69.51A.140; RCW 69.51A.085):

No more than 10 qualifying patients may participate in a single collective garden
at any time.

The collective garden may contain no more than 15 plants per patient and no
more than a total of 45 plants.

The garden may contain no more than 24 ounces of usable cannabis per patient
or no more than a total of 72 ounces of usable cannabis.

Each collective garden participant must have a copy of his/her valid
documentation and proof of identification available for inspection on site at all
times.

No usable cannabis from the collective garden may be delivered to anyone other
than one of the qualifying patients participating in the garden.

Bicycle Patrol Program

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

454.1
The Spokane Police Department has established the Bicycle Patrol Program (BPP) for the
purpose of enhancing patrol efforts in the community. Bicycle patrol has been shown to be
an effective way to increase officer visibility in congested areas and their quiet operation can
provide a tactical approach to crimes in progress. The purpose of this policy is to provide
guidelines for the safe and effective operation of the patrol bicycle.

POLICY

454.2
Patrol bicycles may be used for regular patrol duty, traffic enforcement, parking control, or
special events. The use of the patrol bicycle will emphasize their mobility and visibility to
the community.

Bicycles may be deployed to any area at all hours of the day or night, according to
department needs and as staffing levels allow.

Requests for specific deployment of bicycle patrol officers shall be coordinated through the
patrol supervisor or the Shift Commander.

TRAINING

454.3
Participants in the program must complete an initial department approved bicycle-training
course. The initial training shall minimally include the following:

Bicycle patrol strategies.

Bicycle safety and accident prevention.

Operational tactics using bicycles.

•

•

•

•

Qualify with their duty firearm while wearing bicycle safety equipment including the
helmet and riding gloves.

454.4 UNIFORMS AND EQUIPMENT
Bicycle officers shall wear the departmentally approved uniform and safety equipment while
operating the police bicycle. Safety equipment includes departmentally approved helmet,
riding gloves, protective eye-wear and approved footwear. Soft body armor/vest is required.

The bicycle uniform consists of the department approved white polo shirt or white uniform
short-sleeved shirt with white tee shirt worn underneath it and Department approved bicycle
shorts or long bicycle pants, solid white socks, ankle length without logos or brand visible
and department approved bicycle or athletic shoes. The department approved jacket may
also be worn. Spandex black or blue shorts may be worn under the required bicycle shorts.

Bicycle officers shall carry the same equipment on the bicycle patrol duty belt as they would
on a regular patrol assignment if feasible.

Officers will be responsible for obtaining necessary forms, citation books and other needed
equipment to keep available while on bike patrol.

CARE AND USE OF PATROL BICYCLES

454.5
Bicycles are considered vehicles and therefore are subject to all laws, regulations, and
privileges applicable to other vehicles operated upon the highway (RCW 46.04.670).

Every such bicycle shall be equipped with front lights and rear reflectors or lights, and brakes
satisfying the requirements of RCW 46.61.780.

Bicycles utilized for uniformed bicycle patrol shall be equipped with a rear rack and/or saddle
bag(s) sufficient to carry all necessary equipment to handle routine patrol calls including
report writing, vehicle storage and citations.

Bicycle officers shall conduct an inspection of the bicycle and equipment prior to use to
insure proper working order of the equipment. Officers are responsible for the routine care
and maintenance of their assigned equipment (e.g., tire pressure, chain lubrication, overall
cleaning).

If a needed repair is beyond the ability of the bicycle officer, a repair request will be submitted
through the chain of command.

Bicycle maintenance will be performed by a department approved repair shop/technician.

At the end of a bicycle assignment, the bicycle shall be returned clean and ready for the
next tour of duty.

Officers shall not modify the patrol bicycle, remove, modify or add components except with
the expressed approval of the bicycle supervisor, or in the event of an emergency.

Vehicle bicycle racks are available should the officer need to transport the patrol bicycle.
Due to possible component damage, transportation of the patrol bicycle in a trunk or on a
patrol car push-bumper is discouraged.

Bicycles shall be properly secured when not in the officer's immediate presence.

454.6 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITY
Officers must operate the bicycle in compliance with applicable codes under normal
operation. Officers may operate the bicycle without lighting equipment during hours of
darkness when such operation reasonably appears necessary for officer safety and/or
tactical considerations. Officers must use caution and care when operating the bicycle
without lighting equipment.

It shall be the policy of this department that all other bicycle operation shall be in compliance
with the rules of the road except when responding to an emergency call or when in the
pursuit of an actual or suspected violator.

Department purchased bike uniform items and equipment shall be returned to the
quartermaster at the end of the seasonal bike patrol program.

This policy shall establish the professional philosophy and procedures of the Spokane
Police Department when enforcing the provisions of the transient shelter ordinance.

It is the purpose of this policy to prevent the following harms associated with people creating
unlawful shelters on public property and on public right of ways:

(a) Safety hazards to persons and/or property occasioned by use of open flames or fires
without proper containment and/or fire suppression apparatus, and/or obstructions
and/or impediments in public right of way.

(b) Negative environmental impacts occasioned by contamination from improper disposal
of solid waste, detergents and fuels and/or particulate and chemical pollution of the

Foot Pursuit Policy

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

456.1
Foot pursuits are inherently dangerous and require common sense, sound tactics and
heightened officer safety awareness. This policy sets forth guidelines to assist officers in
making the decision to initiate or continue the pursuit of suspects on foot by balancing the
objective of apprehending the suspect with the risk of potential injury to the officer, the
suspect or the public.

POLICY

456.1.1
It is the policy of this department when deciding to initiate or continue a foot pursuit that
officers must continuously balance the objective of apprehending the suspect with the risk
and potential for injury to department personnel, the suspect or the public.

Officers are expected to act reasonably, based on the totality of the circumstances. Absent
exigent circumstances, the safety of department personnel and the public should be the
primary consideration when determining whether a foot pursuit should be initiated or
continued. Officers must be mindful that immediate apprehension of a suspect is rarely
more important than the safety of the public and department personnel.

DECISION TO PURSUE

456.2
Officers may be justified in initiating a foot pursuit of any individual who the officer
reasonably believes is about to engage in, is engaging in or has engaged in criminal activity.
The decision to initiate or continue such a foot pursuit, however, must be continuously
re-evaluated in light of the circumstances presented at the time.

Mere flight by a person who is not suspected of criminal activity shall not serve as the sole
justification for engaging in an extended foot pursuit without the development of reasonable
suspicion of the individual's involvement in criminal activity.

If circumstances permit, surveillance and containment are generally the safest tactics for
In deciding whether to initiate or continue a foot pursuit,
apprehending fleeing persons.
an officer should continuously consider reasonable alternatives to pursuit based upon the
circumstances and resources available, such as the following:

Containment of the area

Canine search

Saturation of the area with patrol personnel

Aerial support

•

•

•

•

•

Apprehension at another time when the identity of the suspect is known or there is
information available that would likely allow for later apprehension, and the need to
immediately apprehend the suspect does not reasonably appear to outweigh the risk
of continuing the pursuit.

456.3 GUIDELINES FOR FOOT PURSUIT
Unless the officer reasonably believes that exigent circumstances exist (e.g. a serious
threat to the safety of personnel or members of the public), officers should consider
alternatives to engaging in or continuing a foot pursuit under the following conditions:

The primary officer should consider discontinuing the pursuit and coordinating
containment pending the arrival of sufficient officers.

The officer becomes aware of unanticipated or unforeseen circumstances that
unreasonably increase the risk to officers or the public.

The officer reasonably believes that the danger to the pursuing officers or public
outweighs the objective of immediate apprehension.

The officer loses possession of his/her firearm or other essential equipment.

The officer or a third party is injured during the pursuit, requiring immediate assistance,
and there are no other emergency personnel available to render assistance.

(m) The suspect's location is no longer definitely known.

The identity of the suspect is established or other information exists that will allow
for the suspect's apprehension at a later time, and it reasonably appears that there
is no immediate threat to department personnel or the public if the suspect is not
immediately apprehended.

RESPONSIBILITIES IN FOOT PURSUITS

INITIATING OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES

456.4.1
Unless relieved by another officer or a supervisor, the initiating officer shall be responsible
for coordinating the progress of the pursuit. When acting alone and when practicable, the
initiating officer should not attempt to overtake and confront the suspect but should attempt
to keep the suspect in sight until sufficient officers are present to safely apprehend the
suspect.

Early communication of available information from the involved officers is essential so that
adequate resources can be coordinated and deployed to bring a foot pursuit to a safe
conclusion. Officers initiating a foot pursuit should broadcast the following information as
soon as it becomes practicable and available:

If

When a foot pursuit terminates, the officer will notify Combined Communications Center of
his/her location and the status of the pursuit termination (e.g., suspect in custody, lost sight
of suspect), and will direct further actions as reasonably appear necessary.

ASSISTING OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES

456.4.2
Whenever any officer announces that he/she is engaged in a foot pursuit, all other officers
should minimize non-essential radio traffic to permit the involved officers maximum access
to the radio frequency.

Any officers who is in a position to intercept a fleeing suspect, or who can assist the primary
officer with the apprehension of the suspect, shall act reasonably and in accordance with
department policy, based upon available information and his/her own observations.

SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY

456.4.3
Upon becoming aware of a foot pursuit, the supervisor shall make every reasonable effort
to ascertain sufficient information necessary to direct responding resources and to take
command, control and coordination of the foot pursuit. The supervisor should respond to the
area whenever possible; the supervisor does not, however, need not be physically present
to exercise control over the pursuit. The supervisor shall continuously assess the situation
in order to ensure the foot pursuit is conducted within established department guidelines.

The supervisor shall terminate the foot pursuit when the danger to pursuing officers or the
public unreasonably appears to outweigh the objective of immediate apprehension of the
suspect.

Upon apprehension of the suspect, the supervisor shall promptly proceed to the termination
point to direct the post-pursuit activity.

456.4.4
COMBINED COMMUNICATIONS CENTER RESPONSIBILITIES
Upon being notified or becoming aware that a foot pursuit is in progress, communication
personnel shall, as soon as practical, notify the field supervisor and provide available
information. Communication personnel are also responsible for the following:

(a) Clear the radio channel of non-emergency traffic.

(b) Repeat the transmissions of the pursuing officer as needed.

(c)

Ensure that a field supervisor is notified of the pursuit.

Automated License Plate Readers

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

462.1
Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) technology, also known as License Plate
Recognition, provides automated detection of license plates. ALPR is used by the Spokane
Police Department to convert data associated with vehicle license plates for official law
enforcement purposes,
including identifying stolen or wanted vehicles, stolen license
plates and missing persons. ALPRs may also be used to gather information related to
active warrants, homeland security, electronic surveillance, suspect interdiction and stolen
property recovery.

ADMINISTRATION OF ALPR DATA

462.2
All installation and maintenance of ALPR equipment shall be managed by Law Enforcement
Information Systems (LEIS). LEIS will assign a technician to administer the day-to-day
operation of the ALPR equipment and data. The ALPR technician will monitor the ALPR
server each shift to ensure the stolen auto hot list is downloaded from the Washington
State Patrol server on a regular basis and that ALPR operators field data is being uploaded
and stored properly. ALPR data retention and access will be managed by the Investigative
Division who will assign a first line supervisor to this function.

ALPR OPERATION

462.3
Use of an ALPR is restricted to the purposes outlined below. Department personnel shall
not use, or allow others to use, the equipment or database records for any unauthorized
purpose.
(a) An ALPR shall only be used for official and legitimate law enforcement business.
(b) An ALPR may be used in conjunction with any patrol operation or official department
investigation. Reasonable suspicion or probable cause is not required before using
an ALPR.

(c) While an ALPR may be used to canvass license plates around any crime scene,
particular consideration should be given to using ALPR-equipped cars to canvass
areas around homicides, shootings and other major incidents. Partial license plates
reported during major crimes should be entered into the ALPR system in an attempt
to identify suspect vehicles.

(d) No member of this department shall operate ALPR equipment, or access ALPR data,

without first completing department-approved training.
If practicable,
the officer should verify an ALPR response through the Central
Computerized Enforcement Service System (ACCESS) before taking enforcement
action that is based solely upon an ALPR alert.
No ALPR operator may retrieve ACCESS data unless otherwise authorized to do so.

(e)

(f)

ALPR DATA COLLECTION AND RETENTION

462.4
All data and images gathered by ALPR are for the official use of the Spokane Police
Department and because such data may contain confidential ACCESS information it is not
open to public review. ALPR information gathered and retained by this department may be
used and shared with prosecutors or others only as permitted by law.

Collection and retention of ALPR data is subject to the following guidelines:

(a)

Files will be transferred from field units to department servers in accordance with
current Spokane Police Department file storage procedures.

(b) All ALPR data captured during a shift should be transferred to the department server
before the end of each shift. Once transferred all ALPR data should be immediately
purged from the mobile workstation.

All ALPR data downloaded to the server shall be stored according to the Washington State
Law Enforcement Records Retention Schedule, and thereafter should be purged unless it
has become, or it is reasonable to believe it will become evidence in a criminal or civil action
or is subject to a lawful action to produce records. In those circumstances the applicable
data should be downloaded from the server onto portable media and booked into evidence.

ACCOUNTABILITY AND SAFEGUARDS

462.5
All saved data will be closely safeguarded and protected by both procedural and
technological means.
The Spokane Police Department will observe the following
safeguards regarding access to and use of stored data:

(a) All requests for access to stored ALPR data shall be logged and a stated purpose for

access must be provided.

(b) All ALPR data downloaded to the mobile workstation and server shall be accessible
only through a login/password-protected system capable of documenting who
accesses the information by name, date and time.

(c)

Persons approved to access ALPR data under these guidelines are permitted to
access the data for legitimate law enforcement purposes only, such as when the data
relate to a specific criminal investigation or department-related civil or administrative
action.

(d) Such ALPR data may be released to other authorized and verified law enforcement

officials and agencies at any time for legitimate law enforcement purposes.

(e) ALPR system audits should be conducted on a regular basis.

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Traffic Function and Responsibility

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

500.1
The ultimate goal of traffic law enforcement is to reduce traffic collisions. This may be
achieved through the application of such techniques as geographic/temporal assignment
of personnel and equipment and the establishment of preventive patrols to deal with
specific categories of unlawful driving behavior. Traffic enforcement techniques are based
on accident data, enforcement activity records, traffic volume, and traffic conditions. This
department provides enforcement efforts toward violations, not only in proportion to the
frequency of their occurrence in accident situations, but also in terms of traffic-related
needs.

TRAFFIC OFFICER DEPLOYMENT

500.2
Several factors are considered in the development of deployment schedules for officers of
the Spokane Police Department. Some of the factors for analysis include:

•
•
•
•

Location
Time
Day
Violation factors

All officers assigned to patrol or traffic enforcement functions will emphasize enforcement
of accident causing violations during high accident hours and at locations of occurrence. All
officers will take directed enforcement action on request, and random enforcement action
when appropriate against violators as a matter of routine.

Other factors to be considered for deployment are citizen requests, construction zones or
special events.

ENFORCEMENT

500.3
Enforcement actions are commensurate with applicable laws and take into account the
degree and severity of the violation committed. This department does not establish ticket
quotas and the number of arrests or citations issued by any officer shall not be used as
the sole criterion for evaluating officer overall performance. The visibility and quality of
an officer's work effort will be commensurate with the philosophy of this policy. Several
methods are effective in the reduction of collisions:

500.3.1 WARNINGS
Warnings or other non-punitive enforcement actions should be considered in each situation
and substituted for arrests or citations when circumstances warrant, especially in the case
of inadvertent violations.

CITATIONS

500.3.2
Citations may be issued when an officer believes it is appropriate. It is essential that officers
fully explain the rights and requirements imposed on motorists upon issuance of a citation
for a traffic violation. Officers should provide the following information at a minimum:

(a) Explanation of the violation or charge.

(b) Court appearance procedure including the optional or mandatory appearance by the

motorist.

(c) Notice of whether the motorist can enter a plea and pay the fine by mail or at the court.

PHYSICAL ARREST

500.3.3
Officers may issue a traffic citation for any criminal traffic offense or infraction when such
violations are committed in the officer's presence or as allowed pursuant to RCW 10.31.100.
With limited exceptions, the detention in such cases may not be for a period of time longer
than is reasonably necessary to issue and serve a citation to the violator.

A traffic-related detention for any offense listed in RCW 46.63.020 may expand to a qhysical
arrest under the following circumstances:

(a) When the officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has been committed,

whether or not it ws in the officer's presence.

(b) When the offense is one or more of the violations listed in RCW 10.31.100(3).

(c)

Felony hit-and-run.

(d) Any other misdemeanor at the discretion of the officer, such as reckless driving.

SUSPENDED OR REVOKED DRIVERS LICENSES

500.4
If an officer contacts a traffic violator for driving on a suspended or revoked license, the
officer may issue a traffic citation.

If a computer check of a traffic violator's license status reveals a suspended or revoked
drivers license and the traffic violator still has his/her license in possession, the license
shall be seized by the officer. The officer shall verbally advise the traffic violator of the
suspension or revocation and issue the citation.

SUSPENDED, REVOKED OR CANCELED COMMERCIAL LICENSE

500.4.1
PLATES
If an officer contacts a traffic violator who is operating a commercial motor vehicle with
registration that a computer check confirms to be revoked, suspended or canceled, the
officer shall confiscate the license plates. The Department may either recycle or destroy
the plates (RCW 46.32.100).

500.5 HIGH-VISIBILITY VESTS
The Department has provided ANSI Class II high-visibility vests to reduce the danger to
employees who may be exposed to hazards presented by passing traffic, construction
vehicles and disaster recovery equipment (23 CFR 634.3).

Although intended primarily for use while performing traffic related assignments,
high-visibility vests should be worn at any time increased visibility would improve the safety
or efficiency of the employee.

REQUIRED USE

500.5.1
Except when working in a potentially adversarial or confrontational role, such as during
vehicle stops, high-visibility vests should be worn at any time it is anticipated that an
employee will be exposed to the hazards of approaching traffic or construction and
recovery equipment. High-visibility vests shall be worn during traffic control duties, accident
investigations, lane closures and while at disaster scenes, or anytime high visibility is

desirable. When emergency conditions preclude the immediate donning of the vest,
officers should retrieve and wear the vest as soon as conditions reasonably permit. Use of
the vests shall also be mandatory when directed by a supervisor.

Vests maintained in the investigative vehicles may be used any time a plainclothes officer
might benefit from being readily identified as a member of law enforcement.

GUIDELINES FOR USE OF REFLECTORIZED VESTS

500.5.2
It is intended that reflectorized vests be worn at any time an officer anticipates prolonged
exposure to the hazards of approaching traffic created by assignment to duties such as
traffic control and accident investigation. Officers may use their discretion regarding the
wearing of vests during daylight hours. Use is strongly encouraged while directing traffic
during hours of darkness or when visibility is limited due to inclement weather conditions.
Vests maintained in the investigation units may be used any time a plain-clothes officer
might benefit from being easily identified as a police officer. Use of the vests shall also be
mandatory when a supervising officer directs their use to be appropriate.

500.6 HAZARDOUS ROAD CONDITIONS
The Spokane Police Department will make all reasonable efforts to address all reported
hazardous road conditions in a timely manner as circumstances and resources permit.

SPEED MEASURING DEVICES

500.7
Prior to operating a speed measuring device, the officer must have successfully completed
the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission basic training.

Operators shall test and calibrate the equipment in accordance with training.

Unless each and every test result is within the tolerance level set forth by the manufacturer,
the equipment will be taken out of service and repaired by authorized personnel.

500.8
SPEEDING IN A SCHOOL ZONE COMPLAINT PROCEDURE
It is the responsibility of the Traffic Lieutenant to establish a report form and a procedure

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Vehicle Towing and Release

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

510.1
This policy provides the procedures for towing a vehicle by or at the direction of the Spokane
Police Department.

510.2
The responsibilities of those employees towing or impounding a vehicle are as follows.

RESPONSIBILITIES

510.2.1
REMOVAL OF VEHICLE DISABLED IN A TRAFFIC COLLISION
When a vehicle has been involved in a traffic collision and must be removed from the
scene, the officer shall have the driver select a towing company, if possible, and shall relay
the request for the specified towing company to the police dispatcher. When there is no
preferred company requested, or the driver is incapacitated or unavailable, a tow company
will be selected from the rotational
list of towing companies utilized by the Combined
Communications Center.

If the owner is incapacitated, unavailable, or for any reason it is necessary for the
department to remove a vehicle from the public right-of-way to a place of safety, the officer
will complete a Uniform Washington State Tow/Impound and Inventory Record form.

DRIVING A NON-CITY VEHICLE

510.2.2
Generally, non-city vehicles should not be driven by police personnel unless it is necessary
to move a vehicle a short distant, or for exigent circumstances.

DISPATCHER'S RESPONSIBILITIES

510.2.3
Upon receiving a request for towing, the dispatcher will verify with the officer making
the request what type of impound/tow this is and shall promptly telephone the specified
authorized towing service. The officer shall be advised when the request has been made
and the towing service has been dispatched.

When there is no preferred company requested, the dispatcher shall call the next tow
company in rotation from the list of approved towing companies.

TOWING SERVICES

510.3
The Spokane Police Department maintains a rotational list of tow companies who enter into
a mutual agreement with the department. These tow companies must be licensed by DOL
pursuant to RCW Chapter 46 and WAC Titles 204 and 308.

Nothing in this policy shall require the department to tow a vehicle.

STORAGE AT ARREST SCENES

510.4
Whenever a person in charge or in control of a vehicle is arrested, it is the policy of this
department to provide reasonable safekeeping for the arrestee's vehicle. The vehicle shall
be stored whenever it is mandated by law, needed for the furtherance of an investigation
or prosecution of the case or when the Community Caretaker Doctrine would reasonably
suggest it. For example, the vehicle would present a traffic hazard if not removed, or due
to a high crime area the vehicle would be in jeopardy of theft or damage if left at the scene.

Adopted: 2013/04/09 © 1995-2013 Lexipol, LLC

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Vehicle Towing and Release

No impound should occur if other alternatives are available that would ensure the vehicle's
protection. Factors that should be considered by officers in determining whether to impound
a vehicle pursuant to this policy include:

(a) Whether the offense for which the subject was arrested mandates vehicle impound
(i.e. DUI, commercial sexual abuse of a minor, promoting commercial sexual abuse
of a minor, or promoting travel for commercial sexual abuse of a minor (RCW
9A.88.140(2)).

(b) Whether someone is available at the scene of the arrest to whom the vehicle could

be released.

(c) Whether the vehicle is impeding the flow of traffic or is a danger to public safety.

(d) Whether the vehicle can be secured.

(e) Whether there is some reasonable connection between the crime/arrest and the
vehicle, or the vehicle is related to the commission of another crime (i.e., the vehicle
itself has evidentiary value).

(f) Whether the owner/operator requests that the vehicle be stored/impounded at owners

(g) Whether the vehicle would be in jeopardy of theft or damage if left at the scene in a

expense.

high-crime area.

In cases where a vehicle is not stored/impounded, the handling employee shall note in the
report that the owner was informed that the Department will not be responsible for theft or
damages to the vehicle.

VEHICLE INVENTORY

510.5
All property in a stored or impounded vehicle shall be inventoried and listed on the vehicle
storage form. A locked vehicle trunk shall not be opened, even if it may be opened without
a key from an accessible area of the passenger compartment. Locked or closed containers
located within the passenger compartment should be inventoried as a sealed unit, absent
exigent circumstances. Should an item of evidentiary value be found, stop inventory and
obtain a search warrant.

Members conducting a vehicle inventory should be as thorough and accurate as practical
in preparing an itemized inventory. These inventory procedures are for the purpose of
protecting an owner's property while in police custody, to provide for the safety of officers,
and to protect the department against fraudulent claims of lost, stolen, or damaged property.

VEHICLE SEARCHES

510.6
A search warrant should be obtained prior to conducting the search of a vehicle except in
very limited circumstances as enumerated below:

(a) With valid consent of the operator

(b)

To make a limited search for weapons when a reasonable suspicion exists that a
suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of a weapon

(c)

Under emergency circumstances not otherwise enumerated above

Warrantless searches of vehicles are subject
to numerous other restrictions under
specific conditions. Officers should, whenever possible, seek supervisory approval before
conducting a warrantless search of a vehicle.

SECURITY OF VEHICLES AND PROPERTY

510.7
Unless it would cause an unreasonable delay in the completion of a vehicle
impound/storage or create an issue of officer safety, officers should make reasonable
accommodations to permit a driver/owner to retrieve small
items of value or personal
need (e.g. cash, jewelry, cell phone, prescriptions) which are not considered evidence
or contraband.

If a search of a vehicle leaves the vehicle or any property contained therein vulnerable
to unauthorized entry, theft or damage, search personnel shall take such steps as are
reasonably necessary to secure and/or preserve the vehicle or property from such hazards.

TOWING OF HULK VEHICLES

510.8
Hulk vehicles should be towed by the Abandoned Auto personnel during work hours. They
should only be towed by patrol officers in emergency situations, i.e., blocking the roadway.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

514.1
This policy provides guidance to those department members who play a role in the detection
and investigation of driving under the influence (DUI).

POLICY

514.2
The Spokane Police Department is committed to the safety of the roadways and the
community and will pursue fair but aggressive enforcement of Washington's impaired
driving laws.

DRUG RECOGNITION EXPERT

514.2.1
A Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) should be utilized if an officer has reasonable grounds to
suspect a driver is under the influence of drugs. Every attempt to contact an on-duty DRE
should be made.

The officer should conduct standardized field sobriety tests (SFST's), use a portable
breath test (PBT) device or BAC instrument, and place the subject under arrest.
If the
driver/suspect is over a .08 BAC, process as a regular DUI. If under a .08 or no BAC, have
the Combined Communications Center contact a DRE. If no DRE is available, read the
Implied Consent Warning for Blood and process accordingly.

A DRE should be called to the scene of every serious injury or fatal injury collision. If SPD
does not have a DRE on shift, contact WSP Dispatch to see if any DRE's are on shift in the
surrounding area. If no DRE's are available on duty, call out an SPD DRE.

Note - Refer to Patrol SOP 230

514.3
All officers are expected to enforce these laws with due diligence.

in a prearranged transaction or series of prearranged
transactions with direct face-to-face contact with any party, when the juvenile's participation
in the transaction is for the purpose of obtaining or attempting to obtain evidence of illegal
activity by a third party and where the juvenile is participating in the transaction for the
purpose of reducing or dismissing a pending juvenile petition against the juvenile. Use of
juvenile informants should be an exceptional investigative technique, and requires both
the approval of a Bureau Commander and the consent of the juvenile's parent or guardian.

Eyewitness Identification

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

610.1
This policy sets forth guidelines to be used when members of this department employ
eyewitness identification techniques.

610.1.1
Definitions related to the policy include:

DEFINITIONS

Eyewitness identification process - Any field identification, live lineup or photographic
identification.

Field identification (also known as Field Elimination Show-Ups or One-On-One
Identifications) - A live presentation of a single individual to a witness following the
commission of a criminal offense for the purpose of identifying or eliminating the person
as the suspect.

Live lineup - A live presentation of individuals to a witness for the purpose of identifying or
eliminating an individual as the suspect.

Photographic lineup - Presentation of photographs to a witness for the purpose of
identifying or eliminating an individual as the suspect.

POLICY

610.2
This department will strive to use eyewitness identification techniques, when appropriate,
to enhance the investigative process and will emphasize identifying persons responsible for
crime and exonerating the innocent.

INTERPRETIVE SERVICES

610.3
Officers should make a reasonable effort to arrange for an interpreter before proceeding
with eyewitness identification if communication with a witness is impeded due to language
or hearing barriers.

Before the interpreter is permitted to discuss any matter with the witness, the investigating
officer should explain the identification process to the interpreter. Once it is determined that
the interpreter comprehends the process and can explain it to the witness, the eyewitness
identification may proceed as provided for within this policy.

EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION FORM

610.4
The Investigation Bureau supervisor shall be responsible for the development and
maintenance of an eyewitness identification process for use by members when they are
conducting eyewitness identifications.

The process and any related forms or reports should provide:

(a)

(b)

(c)

The date, time and location of the eyewitness identification procedure.

The name and identifying information of the witness.

The name of the person administering the identification procedure.

Eyewitness Identification - 321

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Eyewitness Identification

(d)

If applicable, the names of all of the individuals present during the identification
procedure.

(e) An admonishment that the suspect may or may not be among those presented and

(f)

that the witness is not obligated to make an identification.
An admonishment to the witness that the investigation will continue regardless of
whether an identification is made by the witness.

(g) A signature line where the witness acknowledges that he/she understands the

identification procedures and instructions.

EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION

610.5
Officers are cautioned not to, in any way, influence a witness as to whether any subject
or photo presented in a lineup is in any way connected to the case. Officers should avoid
mentioning that:
•
•
•

The individual was apprehended near the crime scene.
The evidence points to the individual as the suspect.
Other witnesses have identified, or failed to identify, the individual as the suspect.

In order to avoid undue influence, witnesses should view suspects or a lineup individually
and outside the presence of other witnesses. Witnesses should be instructed to avoid
discussing details of the incident or of the identification process with other witnesses.

Each witness should be admonished that he/she is not required to make an identification
of any person shown during an eyewitness identification process.

Whenever feasible, the eyewitness identification procedure should be audio and/or video
recorded and the recording should be retained according to current evidence procedures.

PHOTOGRAPHIC AND LIVE LINEUP CONSIDERATIONS

610.5.1
The member presenting the lineup shall take the utmost care not to communicate the identity
of the suspect in any way.

Other persons or photos used in any lineup should bear similar characteristics to the suspect
to avoid causing him/her to unreasonably stand out. In cases involving multiple suspects,
a separate lineup should be conducted for each suspect. The suspects should be placed
in a different order within each lineup.

The employee presenting the lineup to a witness should do so sequentially and not
simultaneously (i.e., show the witness one person at a time). The witness should view all
persons in the lineup.

The order of the suspect or the photos and the fillers should be randomized before being
presented to each witness.

A live lineup should only be used before criminal proceedings have been initiated against
the suspect. If there is any question as to whether any criminal proceedings have begun, the
investigating officer should contact the appropriate prosecuting attorney before proceeding.

FIELD IDENTIFICATION CONSIDERATIONS

610.5.2
Field identifications, also known as field elimination show-ups or one-on-one identifications,
may be helpful in certain cases, where exigent circumstances make it impracticable to
conduct a photo or live lineup identifications. A field elimination or show-up identification

should not be used when independent probable cause exists to arrest a suspect. In such
cases a live or photo lineup is the preferred course of action if eyewitness identification is
contemplated.

When initiating a field identification, the officer should observe the following guidelines:

(a) Obtain a complete description of the suspect from the witness.

(b) Assess whether a witness should be included in a field identification process by

considering:

The length of time the witness observed the suspect.

The distance between the witness and the suspect.

3. Whether the witness could view the suspect's face.

4.

The quality of the lighting when the suspect was observed by the witness.

5. Whether there were distracting noises or activity during the observation.

Any other circumstances affecting the witness's opportunity to observe the
suspect.

The length of time that has elapsed since the witness observed the suspect.

(c)

If safe and practicable, the person who is the subject of the show-up should not be
handcuffed or in a patrol vehicle.

(d) When feasible, officers should bring the witness to the location of the suspect, rather

than bring the suspect to the witness.

(e) A person should not be shown to the same witness more than once.

(f)

In cases involving multiple suspects, witnesses should only be permitted to view the
suspects one at a time.

(g) A person in a field identification should not be required to put on clothing worn by the
suspect, to speak words uttered by the suspect or to perform other actions mimicking
those of the suspect.

(h)

If a witness positively identifies an individual as the perpetrator, officers should not
conduct any further field identifications with other witnesses for that suspect.
In
such instances officers should document the contact information for any additional
witnesses for follow up, if necessary.

DOCUMENTATION

610.6
A thorough description of the eyewitness process and the results of any eyewitness
identification should be documented in the case report. Witness comments of how certain
he/she is of the identification or non-identification should be quoted in the report.

Documentation should specifically include the following (U.S. v. Traeger, 289 F.3d 461 (7th
Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 123 S. Ct. 550 (U.S. 2002); 35 Am. Jur. Proof of Facts 3d 1

Personal Communication Devices

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

702.1
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the use of mobile telephones and
communication devices, whether issued by the Department or personally owned, while
on-duty or when used for authorized work-related purposes.

This policy generically refers to all such devices as Personal Communication Devices
(PCD) but is intended to include all mobile telephones, personal digital assistants (PDA)
and similar wireless two-way communications and/or portable Internet access devices.
PCD use includes, but is not limited to, placing and receiving calls,
text messaging,
blogging and microblogging, e-mailing, using video or camera features, playing games
and accessing sites or services on the Internet.

POLICY

702.2
The Spokane Police Department allows employees to utilize department-issued PCDs and
to possess personally owned PCDs in the workplace, subject to certain limitations. Any
PCD used while on-duty, or used off-duty in any manner reasonably related to the business
of the Department, will be subject to monitoring and inspection consistent with the standards
set forth in this policy.

The inappropriate use of a PCD while on-duty may impair officer safety. Additionally,
employees are advised and cautioned that the use of a personally owned PCD either
on-duty or after duty hours for business-related purposes may subject the employee and
the employee's PCD records to civil or criminal discovery or disclosure under applicable
public records laws.

Employees who have questions regarding the application of this policy or the guidelines
contained herein are encouraged to seek clarification from supervisory personnel.

PRIVACY POLICY

702.3
Employees shall have no expectation of privacy with regard to any communication made
with or stored in or through PCDs issued by the Department and shall have no expectation
of privacy in their location should the device be equipped with location detection capabilities.
The use of any department-provided or -funded PCD, computer, Internet service, telephone
service or other wireless service while on-duty is without any expectation of privacy that
the employee might otherwise have in any communication, including the content of any
such communication. Communications or data reception on personal, password-protected,
web-based e-mail accounts and any other services are subject to monitoring if department
equipment is used.

In accordance with this policy, supervisors are authorized to conduct a limited
administrative search of electronic files without prior notice, consent or a search warrant,
on department-issued or personally owned PCDs that have been used to conduct
department-related business. Administrative searches can take place for work-related
purposes that may be unrelated to investigations of employee misconduct and, as
practicable, will be done in the presence of the affected employee. Prior to conducting any
search of personally owned devices, supervisors shall consult with the Chief of Police. All
such searches shall be fully documented in a written report.

its discretion,

DEPARTMENT-ISSUED PCD

702.4
Depending on an employee's assignment and the needs of the position, the Department
issue a PCD. Department-issued PCDs are provided as a
may, at
convenience to facilitate on-duty performance only. Such devices and the associated
telephone number shall remain the sole property of the Department and shall be subject
to inspection or monitoring (including all related records and content) at any time without
notice and without cause.

Unless an employee is expressly authorized by the Chief of Police or the authorized
designee for off-duty use of the PCD, the PCD will either be secured in the workplace at
the completion of the tour of duty or will be turned off when leaving the workplace.

PERSONALLY OWNED PCD

702.5
Employees may carry a personally owned PCD while on-duty, subject to the following
conditions and limitations:

(a) Carrying a personally owned PCD is a privilege, not a right.

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

The Department accepts no responsibility for loss of or damage to a personally owned
PCD.

Employees shall promptly notify the Department in the event the PCD is lost or stolen.

The PCD and any associated services shall be purchased, used and maintained solely
at the employee's expense.

The device should not be used for work-related purposes except
in exigent
circumstances (e.g., unavailability of radio communications). Employees will have a
reduced expectation of privacy when using a personally owned PCD in the workplace
and have no expectation of privacy with regard to any department business-related
communication.

The device shall not be utilized to record or disclose any business-related information,
including photographs, video or the recording or transmittal of any information or
material obtained or made accessible as a result of employment with the Department,
without the express authorization of the Chief of Police or the authorized designee.

(g) Use of a personally owned PCD constitutes consent for the Department to access the
PCD to inspect and copy data to meet the needs of the Department, which may include
litigation, public records retention and release obligations and internal investigations.
If the PCD is carried on-duty, employees will provide the Department with all telephone
access numbers of the device.

Except with prior express authorization from their supervisor employees are not obligated
or required to carry, access, monitor or respond to electronic communications using a
personally owned PCD while off-duty.
If an employee is in an authorized status that
allows for appropriate compensation consistent with policy or existing collective bargaining
agreements, or if the employee has prior express authorization from his/her supervisor,
the employee may engage in business-related communications. Should employees
engage in such approved off-duty communications or work, employees entitled to
compensation shall promptly document the time worked and communicate the information
to their supervisors to ensure appropriate compensation. Employees who independently
document off-duty department-related business activities in any manner shall promptly
provide the Department with a copy of such records to ensure accurate record keeping.

702.6 USE OF PERSONAL COMMUNICATION DEVICES
The following protocols shall apply to all PCDs that are carried while on-duty or used to
conduct department business:

(a) A PCD shall not be carried in a manner that allows it to be visible while in uniform,

unless it is in an approved carrier.

(b) All PCDs in the workplace shall be set to silent or vibrate mode.

(c)

A PCD may not be used to conduct personal business while on-duty, except for brief
personal communications (e.g., informing family of extended hours). Employees shall
endeavor to limit their use of PCDs to authorized break times, unless an emergency
exists.

(d) Employees may use a PCD to communicate with other personnel in situations where
the use of the radio is either impracticable or not feasible. PCDs should not be used
as a substitute for, as a way to avoid or in lieu of regular radio communications.

(e) Officers are prohibited from taking pictures, video or making audio recording or making
copies of any such picture or recording media unless it is directly related to official
department business. Disclosure of any such information to any third party through
any means, without the express authorization of the Chief of Police or the authorized
designee, may result in discipline.

(f)

Employees will not access social networking sites for any purpose that is not official
department business.

(g) Using PCDs to harass, threaten, coerce or otherwise engage in inappropriate conduct
with any third party is prohibited. Any employee having knowledge of such conduct
shall promptly notify a supervisor.

SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITIES

702.7
Supervisors should ensure that members under their command are provided appropriate
training on the use of PCDs consistent with this policy. Supervisors should monitor, to
the extent practicable, PCD use in the workplace and take prompt corrective action if an
employee is observed or reported to be improperly using a PCD. An investigation into
improper conduct should be promptly initiated when circumstances warrant.

If, when carrying out any provision of this policy, the need to contact an employee who is
off-duty arises, supervisors should consider delaying the contact, if practicable, until the
employee is on-duty as such contact may be compensable.

702.8 USE WHILE DRIVING
The use of a PCD while driving can adversely affect safety, cause unnecessary distractions
and present a negative image to the public. Officers operating emergency vehicles
should restrict the use of these devices to matters of an urgent nature and should, where
practicable, stop the vehicle at an appropriate location to use the PCD.

Except in an emergency, employees who are operating non-emergency vehicles shall not
use a PCD while driving unless the device is specifically designed and configured to allow
hands-free use (RCW 46.61.668). Hands-free use should be restricted to business-related
calls or calls of an urgent nature.

702.9 OFFICIAL USE
Employees are reminded that PCDs are not secure devices and conversations may be
intercepted or overheard. Caution should be exercised while utilizing PCDs to ensure that

sensitive information is not inadvertently transmitted. As soon as reasonably possible,
employees shall conduct sensitive or private communications on a land-based or other
department communications network.

The following situations are examples of when the use of a PCD may be appropriate:

(a) Barricaded suspects

(b) Hostage situations

(c) Mobile Command Post

(d) Catastrophic disasters, such as plane crashes, earthquakes, floods, etc.

(e) Major political or community events

(f)

Investigative stakeouts

(g) Emergency contact with an allied agency or allied agency field unit

(h) When immediate communication is needed and the use of the radio is not available

or appropriate and other means are not readily available

emergencies. The latter situation places the greatest demands upon the communications
system and tests the capability of the system to fulfill its functions. Measures and standards
of performance are necessary to assess the effectiveness with which any department, large
or small, uses available information technology in fulfillment of its missions.

SPD Communications Team will strive to consistently provide the highest quality service
to the citizens while maintaining the utmost level of officer safety through a commitment to
excellence, professionalism and integrity with the resources provided.

OFFICER IDENTIFICATION

802.3.1
Identification systems are based on factors such as beat assignment and officer unit
designators ("call signs"). Employees should use the entire call sign when initiating
communication with the dispatcher. The use of the call sign allows for a brief pause so that
the dispatcher can acknowledge the appropriate unit. Employees initiating communication
with other agencies shall use their entire call sign. This requirement does not apply to
continuing conversation between the mobile unit and dispatcher once the mobile unit has
been properly identified.

enforcement purposes, a Law Enforcement Property Retention Request form must be
submitted to the employee's chain of command for approval. Any item that an employee
and/or agency wish to retain must strictly meet the criteria listed above for approval to be
granted. If the item is approved, the Property and Evidence Facility will release the property
to the requesting unit ensuring compliance with the requirements in RCW 63.32.20 or
63.40.020. The property will be added to the retained property inventory. An inventory
will be maintained and available for public inspection. The Property and Evidence Facility

Restoration of Firearm Serial Numbers

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

808.1
The primary purpose for restoring firearm serial numbers is to determine the prior owners
or origin of the item from which the number has been recovered. Thus, property can
be returned to rightful owners or investigations can be initiated to curb illegal trade of
contraband firearms. The purpose of this plan is to develop standards, methodologies,
and safety protocols for the recovery of obliterated serial numbers from firearms and
other objects using procedures that are accepted as industry standards in the forensic
community. All personnel who are involved in the restoration of serial numbers will observe
the following guidelines.

PROCEDURE

808.2
Any firearm coming into the possession of the Spokane Police Department as evidence,
safekeeping, found, or destroy, where the serial numbers have been removed or obliterated,
the firearm will be processed in the following manner:

808.2.1

PRELIMINARY FIREARM EXAMINATION

(a) Always treat the firearm as if it were loaded and keep the muzzle pointed in a safe
direction. Unload and clear the firearm. Two firearm clearing barrels are located at
the Property and Evidence Facility. Packaging requirements for firearms are detailed
in the diagrams below. Strict adherence to the packaging policy is required. This
includes removal of the ammunition source (e.g., the detachable magazine, contents
of the tabular magazine) as well as the chamber contents. All firearms will have safety
ties threaded through the barrel as shown and magazine port if applicable.

(b)

(c)

(d)

If the firearm is corroded shut or in a condition that would preclude inspection of the
chamber contents, treat the firearm as if it is loaded. Make immediate arrangements
for a firearms examiner or other qualified examiner to render the firearm safe.

Accurately record/document the condition of the gun when received. Note the
positions of the various components such as the safeties, cylinder, magazine, slide,
hammer, etc. Accurately record/document cylinder chamber and magazine contents.
Package the ammunition separately.

If the firearm is to be processed for fingerprints or trace evidence, process before
the serial number restoration is attempted. First record/document important aspects
such as halos on the revolver cylinder face or other relevant evidence that might be
obscured by the fingerprinting chemicals.

chain of custody and the initial examination and handling of evidence from the time it is
received/collected until it is released.

These reports must include a record of the manner in which and/or from whom the firearm
was received.

FIREARM TRACE

808.2.5
After the serial number has been restored (or partially restored) by the Crime Lab, the
property and evidence technician will enter the data in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and
Firearms web-based Etrace System. The data will reflect that the trace is for an obliterated
and restored serial number.

808.3 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
The WSP Crime Lab is responsible for submission of exemplar bullets and cartridge cases
from the firearm, depending upon acceptance criteria and protocol, and may be submitted to
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) National Integrated Ballistic
Information Network (NIBIN) which uses the Integrated Ballistic Identification System (IBIS)
technology to digitize and compare unique markings made by a firearm on bullets and
cartridge casings recovered from crime scenes.

Privacy Violation (right of privacy, right to privacy, personal privacy) - An invasion or
violation of privacy occurs only if disclosure of information about the person would be highly
offensive to a reasonable person, and is not of legitimate concern to the public. The rights
to privacy in certain public records do not create any right of privacy beyond those rights
that are specified by law as express exemptions from the public's right to inspect, examine,
or copy public records (RCW 42.56.050).

Public Record - Includes any writing containing information relating to the conduct of
government or the performance of any governmental or proprietary function prepared,
owned, used, or retained by any state or local agency regardless of physical form or
characteristics (RCW 42.56.010(2)).

Writing - Means handwriting,
typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, and
every other means of recording any form of communication or representation, including,
but not limited to, letters, words, pictures, sounds, or symbols, or combination thereof,
and all papers, maps, magnetic or paper tapes, photographic films and prints, motion
picture, film and video recordings, magnetic or punched cards, discs, drums, diskettes,
sound recordings, and other documents including existing data compilations from which
information may be obtained or translated (RCW 42.56.010(3)).

PUBLIC RECORDS OFFICER

810.3
The Records Manager is designated as the Public Records Officer for the department and is
responsible as the point of contact for members of the public when requesting disclosure of
public records and in overseeing the agency's compliance with the public records disclosure
requirements.

The Records Manager will post his/her name, role as the Public Records Officer, and contact
information in the facility conspicuously visible to the public, and on the department Internet
site, and upon appropriate publications so as to provide easy access to members of the
public for directing requests for disclosure of public records (RCW 42.56.580).

PUBLIC REQUESTS FOR RECORDS

810.4
The Public Records Act provides that public records created by a public agency shall be
subject to inspection and copying pursuant to request, except pursuant to exemptions set
forth in the Act or otherwise established by statute (RCW 42.56.070(1)).

The Records Manager shall publish, maintain, and make available to the public, a current list
containing every law that exempts or prohibits disclosure of specific information or records
of the department (RCW 42.56.070(2)).

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Computers and Digital Evidence

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

814.1
This policy establishes procedures for the seizure and storage of computers, personal
communications devices (PCDs) digital cameras, digital recorders and other electronic
devices that are capable of storing digital information; and for the preservation and storage
of digital evidence. All evidence seized and/or processed pursuant to this policy shall be
done so in compliance with clearly established Fourth Amendment and search and seizure
provisions.

SEIZING COMPUTERS AND RELATED EVIDENCE

814.2
Computer equipment requires specialized training and handling to preserve its value as
evidence. Officers should be aware of the potential to destroy information through careless
or improper handling, and utilize the most knowledgeable available resources. When
seizing a computer and accessories the following steps should be taken:

(a) Photograph each item, front and back, specifically including cable connections to

other items. Look for a phone line or cable to a modem for Internet access.

(b) Do not overlook the possibility of the presence of physical evidence on and around
the hardware relevant to the particular investigation such as fingerprints, biological or
trace evidence, and/or documents.

(c)

(d)

(e)

(f)

(g)

If the computer is off, do not turn it on.

If the computer is on, do not shut it down normally and do not click on anything or
examine any files. Officers should contact an officer specially trained in processing
computers as evidence for assistance or direction on how to process or properly
secure the computer. After hours, this may be done by contacting the DSO.

1.

2.

Photograph the screen, if possible, and note any programs or windows that
appear to be open and running.

Attempt to determine if the computer has access or is connected to a secured
or unsecured wireless network. This information should be noted in the report.

Label each item with case number, evidence sheet number, and item number.

Handle and transport the computer and storage media (e.g., tape, disc's, memory
cards, flash memory, external drives) with care so that potential evidence is not lost.

Log all computer items into the Property and Evidence Facility. Do not store
computers where normal room temperature and humidity is not maintained.

(h) At minimum, officers should document the following in related reports:

1. Where the computer was located and whether or not it was in operation.

2. Who was using it or had access to it at the time of the crime.

3. Who claimed ownership.

4.

If it can be determined, how it was being used.

(i)

In most cases when a computer is involved in criminal investigation and is in the
possession of the suspect, the computer itself and all storage devices (hard drives,
tape drives, and disk drives) should be seized along with all media.

Computers and Digital Evidence

(j)

Hard drives can be erased or damaged by magnetic fields. Keep all media away from
magnetic devices, electric motors, radio transmitters or other sources of magnetic
fields (i.e. police radio hardware).

(k) When battery powered computers (e.g. laptops) are involved in criminal investigations
and are in the possession of the suspect, the electrical cords or charging cords should
be seized with the digital device.

BUSINESS OR NETWORKED COMPUTERS

814.2.1
If the computer belongs to a business or is part of a network, it may not be feasible to seize
the entire computer. Cases involving networks require specialized handling. Officers should
contact a certified forensic computer examiner for instructions or a response to the scene.
It may be possible to perform an on-site inspection, or to image the hard drive only of the
involved computer. This should only be done by someone specifically trained in processing
computers for evidence.

FORENSIC EXAMINATION OF COMPUTERS

814.2.2
If an examination of the contents of the computer's hard drive, or floppy discs, compact
discs, or any other storage media is required, forward the following items to a computer
forensic examiner:

(a) Copy of report(s) involving the computer, including the Evidence Report form.
(b) Copy of a consent to search form signed by the computer owner or the person in
possession of the computer, or a copy of a search warrant and search warrant affidavit
authorizing the search of the computer hard drive for evidence relating to investigation.

Custody Searches

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

902.1
The purpose of this policy is to establish consistent department procedures regarding
booking and strip searches of pre-arraignment detainee as provided by RCW 10.79.060,
et. seq.
It is important to note that the legislature has specified their intent to "restrict
the practice of strip searching and body cavity searching persons booked into holding,
detention, or local correctional facilities to those situations where such searches are
necessary" (RCW 10.79.060). This policy shall also include pat-down/frisk, which are not
evidentiary searches.

DEFINITIONS

902.2
Pat-Down Frisk - A protective pat-down used by officers in the field to check an individual
for weapons.
It involves a thorough patting down of clothing to locate any weapons or
dangerous items that could pose a danger to the officer, the prisoner, or other prisoners.
An officer must have reasonable suspicion that the subject is armed and dangerous in order
to justify a non-consensual pat-down.

Custodial Arrest Search - This search is used by officers who have conducted a custodial
arrest. Where saft to do so, officers should conduct this search as soon as possible
It
after making the custodial arrest and prior to placing the arrestee in a patrol vehicle.
involves a thorough search of an individual's clothing/person and other property in their
immediate possession. All pockets, cuffs, backpacks, purses, etc., are checked to locate
all personal property, contraband, or weapons. The prisoner's personal property is taken
In this
and inventoried. The prisoner's personal property is removed and inventoried.
type of search, all items are removed from a prisoner's possession and placed in a plastic
bag, if available. This property is then turned over to jail staff or, in certain circumstances,
placed on Property. Any property of significant value should be properly documented.
Large sums of money should be counted in the presence of another witness officer.

Strip Search - This is not a body cavity search; this is a search that requires a person
to remove or rearrange some or all of their clothing to permit a visual inspection of the
underclothing, breasts, buttocks or genitalia of such person (RCW 10.79.070(1)).

Physical Body Cavity Search - This is the touching or probing of a person's body cavity,
whether or not there is actual penetration of the body cavity (RCW 10.79.070(2)). Body
cavity means the stomach or rectal cavity of a person, and the vagina of a female person
(RCW 10.79.070(3)).

PAT DOWN FRISK

902.3
(a) When any officer has reasonable suspicion based on articulable facts to believe that
a person being lawfully detained may possess weapons or other dangerous items,
and is presently dangerous, that officer may conduct a normal pat-down frisk of that
individual.

(b) Prior to detaining any individual in any police vehicle, an officer should conduct a
pat-down frisk of that individual to ensure no weapons are present that could later be
used against the officer or another officer.

(c) Whenever practical, a pat-down frisk of an individual should be conducted by an officer
of the same sex as the person being frisked. Absent the immediate availability of

prisoner with a shower or a change of clothes, a supervisor should be contacted to
ensure reasonable steps are taken to obtain the prisoner's consent and/or otherwise
protect the prisoner's privacy and dignity.

Evaluation of Employees

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1002.1
The objective of
the evaluation system is to record work performance for both the
department and the employee, giving recognition for good work and providing a guide for
improvement where needed. The employee performance evaluation report is a gauge
for measuring performance and may be used for making personnel decisions relating to
promotion, reassignment, discipline, demotion and termination. The report also provides
a guide for mutual work planning and review and an opportunity to convert general
impressions into a more objective history of work performance based on job standards.

POLICY

1002.2
Employee performance evaluations will be written based on job related factors specific
to the position occupied by the employee without regard to sex, race, color, or creed.
Each evaluation will cover a specific period and should be based on performance during
that period. The employee's immediate supervisor will complete each evaluation. Other
supervisors directly familiar with the employee's performance during the rating period
should be consulted by the immediate supervisor for their input.

All sworn supervisory personnel shall be sent to a WSCJTC approved supervisory course
that includes training on the completion of performance evaluations within one year of the
supervisory appointment.

Each supervisor should discuss the tasks of the position, standards of performance
expected, and the evaluation rating criteria with each employee at the beginning of the
rating period.

EVALUATION FREQUENCY

1002.3
Non-probationary commissioned employee evaluations below the rank of lieutenant are
due in the months of July and January for the preceding six month period. Probationary
employees are evaluated according to the FTO protocol. Commissioned employee
evaluations at the rank of lieutenant and above are due in the month of January for the
preceding twelve month period.

Non-commissioned employees shall receive evaluations as follows:

•

•

•

Original Appointment Probation: During the first year an employee is employed with
the city, there will be three performance evaluations prepared. These evaluations will
be conducted at the end of the 4th, 8th, and 11th months of the probationary period.

Promotional Probationary Period: When a classified employee is promoted to a
higher classification, that employee is on probation for six (6) months. Performance
evaluations will be prepared at the end of the 3rd and 5th months of the probationary
period.

Annual: Each employee who has completed the probationary period will have a
performance evaluation prepared on the anniversary date of employment with the
city. For an employee who has been promoted, the evaluation will be done on the
anniversary date of the completion of the promotional probationary period.

be completed by the current supervisor with input from the previous supervisor.

COMPLETION OF EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

1002.4.1
DOCUMENT
The rater will complete all sections of the document. The rater will rate the employee on the
relevant categories listed on the "performance evaluation" section (commissioned PAR)
of the document. The rater will give the employee an appropriate rating based on the
employee's performance during the rating period.
If the category is not applicable to the
particular employee or not observed by the rater, the rater will note this accordingly.

The "comments" section shall be used to illuminate the reasoning and details behind the
numerical scores on the performance review. Particularly high or low scores will require
greater explanation.

The following section pertains to commissioned personnel only:

The "planned training and/or changes" section should be used to list intended corrections
for any deficiencies, as well as continued career development that the rater believes is
necessary or important for the employee. It may also be used to highlight any goals that
the employee has indicated he/she has, along with suggested training or activities that the
rater believes will help the employee attain those stated goals. The "promotional evaluation
form" will be completed by the rater. This form is provided to Civil Service for promotional
purposes. The percentage scores in the relevant categories shall coincide with the same
or similar categories on the Performance Evaluation.

EVALUATION REVIEW

1002.5
Before the supervisor discusses the evaluation with the employee, the signed performance
evaluation is forwarded to the rater's supervisor (reviewer). The reviewer shall review the

(b) Call U.S. Health Works (747-0776) for an exposure assessment (this number may
go to a paging system after-hours, so be prepared to provide a call-back number).
A doctor will return your call or page within fifteen (15) minutes. There is a critical
two-hour window for treatment to begin. The doctor will assess the exposure as
follows:

Simple Exposure; many exposures do not require further treatment than the
clean-up that you have already done.

Significant Exposure; if the exposure has a significant probability of disease
transfer, the doctor will instruct you to report to a U.S. Health Works Office or
the ER at Deaconess or Sacred Heart Hospitals. You will be given a "base-line"
include testing for HIV, and Hepatitis B and C. Medical
blood test that will
treatment options will be considered at this time.

U.S. Health Works will provide you with your test results at a follow-up appointment
scheduled within the next 24 to 48 hours. They will also provide you with third-party test
results when applicable.

The Centers for Disease Control provides a toll free hotline staffed 24/7 by physicians. This
"post exposure prophylaxis hotline" is 1-888-448-1911. This number is available for you to
call the CDC for consultation if you desire.

does provide for mandatory testing for HIV if the Health Officer agrees
there has been a substantial exposure. Important: The testing must be
conducted within seven days of the original request of the exposed
party for the Health Department to assist.

4.

Ensure that the affected/exposed employee goes to Sacred Heart Hospital to
request their baseline blood test for their L and I claim. The exposed employee
must also give their consent to be tested for HIV. The hospital should have the
needed consent forms.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1020.1
The purpose of this procedure is to provide guidelines for the reporting, investigation
and disposition of complaints regarding the conduct of members and employees of this
department.

DEFINITIONS

1020.1.1
Personnel complaints consist of any allegation of misconduct or improper job performance
against any department employee that, if true, would constitute a violation of department
policy, federal, state or local law.

Personnel Complaints shall be classified in one of the following categories:

Inquiry - Questions about employee conduct which, even if true, would not qualify as a
personnel complaint may be handled informally by a department supervisor and shall not
be considered complaints.

Complaint - A matter in which the complaining party requests further investigation or which
a department supervisor determines that further action is warranted. Such complaints may
be investigated by a department supervisor of rank greater than the accused employee or
referred to the Internal Affairs Unit depending on the seriousness and complexity of the
investigation.

Incomplete - A matter in which the complaining party either refuses to cooperate or
becomes unavailable after diligent follow-up investigation. At the discretion of the Assistant
Chief, such matters need not be documented as personnel complaints, but may be further
investigated depending on the seriousness of the complaint and the availability of sufficient
information.

Mediation - Is a voluntary process and an alternative to investigation, adjudication and the
disciplinary process.

1020.2

AVAILABILITY AND ACCEPTANCE OF COMPLAINTS

AVAILABILITY OF COMPLAINT FORMS

1020.2.1
Personnel complaint forms will be maintained in a clearly visible location in the Public
Safety Building lobby, at all COP Shops, from Internal Affairs, or at the Office of Police
Ombudsman.

(d) Anonymous complaints and third party complaints should be accepted and

investigated to the extent that sufficient information is provided.

ACCEPTANCE OF COMPLAINTS

1020.2.3
A complaint may be filed in person, in writing, or by telephoning the department. Although
not required, every effort should be made to have the complainant appear in person. The
following should be considered before taking a complaint:

(a) When an uninvolved supervisor determines that the reporting person is satisfied
that their complaint required nothing more than an explanation regarding the proper
implementation of department policy or procedure, a complaint need not be taken. A
Citizen Inquiry form will be completed and forwarded to Internal Affairs.

(b) When the complainant's credibility appears to be unreliable, the person should be
provided with a Personnel Complaint form and the supervisor should complete a
Citizen Inquiry form, noting the credibility concerns.

(c) Depending on the urgency and seriousness of the allegations involved, complaints
from juveniles should generally be taken only with their parents or guardians
present and after the parents or guardians have been informed of the circumstances
prompting the complaint.

COMPLAINT DOCUMENTATION

1020.2.4
Complaints of alleged misconduct shall be documented by a supervisor in the computer
program (Blue Team). The supervisor shall ensure that the nature of the complaint is defined
as clearly as possible.

When a Personnel Complaint form is completed in person, the complainant should prepare
a detailed narrative of his/her complaint. If circumstances indicate that this is not feasible,
the complaint may be dictated to the receiving supervisor. In an effort to ensure accuracy
in any complaint, it is recommended, if practicable, that a recorded statement be obtained
from the reporting party. A refusal by a party to be recorded shall not alone be grounds to
refuse to accept a complaint.

SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY

1020.3
In general, preliminary and follow-up investigative responsibility for some administrative
complaints shall rest with the employee's immediate supervisor. The Chief of Police or
authorized designee may, however, direct that another supervisor,
Internal Affairs, or
Human Resources, investigate the complaint. The supervisor shall be responsible for the
following:

(a) A supervisor receiving a complaint involving allegations of a potentially serious nature
shall ensure that the Shift Commander is notified as soon as practicable. The Shift
Commander will determine if the nature of the complaint warrants DSO notification.

(b) A supervisor

receiving or

initiating a complaint, or conducting a preliminary
investigation, shall ensure that a Blue Team entry has been completed as fully as
possible to include; the names and contact information of all involved parties and
witnesses, collection of evidence, photographing of alleged injuries as well as areas
of non-injury, etc. The supervisor will send the original to Internal Affairs by the
end of his/her shift. The Internal Affairs lieutenant will determine if the allegation is
criminal or administrative. If the allegation is criminal, the Internal Affairs lieutenant
will notify the Chief of Police. A decision will then be made as to the proper method
of investigation.

COMPLETION OF INVESTIGATIONS

1020.8
Every investigator or supervisor assigned to investigate a personnel complaint shall
proceed with due diligence. Recognizing that factors such as witness availability and the
complexity of allegations will affect each case, every effort should be made to complete
each investigation as required by Collective Bargaining Agreements.
If the nature of
the allegations dictate that confidentiality is necessary to maintain the integrity of the
investigation, the involved employee(s) need not be notified of the pending investigation
unless and until the employee is interviewed.

(a)

If the complaint is investigated by the shift/unit:

The employee's supervisor will send the completed investigation to Internal
Affairs. The IA lieutenant will review the file for completeness and determine
whether the file will get a chain-of-command review or, a review by an
Administrative Review Panel (ARP).

After the chain-of-command or ARP review, IA will send the file to the accused
employees commander for review.

After commander review, Internal Affairs will forward the file to the Office of the
Police Ombudsman (OPO) for certification.

After OPO certification, IA will send the file to the Assistant Chief for review.

The Assistant Chief sends the file to the Chief of Police for disposition.

File is sent to the Assistant Chief for review

Assistant Chief sends file to Chief of Police for disposition

Within 30 days of case closure, written notice of the findings shall be sent to the complaining
party. This notice shall indicate the findings, however, will not disclose the amount of
discipline, if any imposed.

The OPO will be notified by IA within five business days of case closure of all complaints
of a serious matter and all complaints originated by the OPO. The OPO, in addition to the
department's written Notice of Finding letter to the complainant, may send a closing letter

All formal personnel complaints shall be maintained in accordance with Washington State
Retention Guidelines.

Sustained complaints shall be maintained in the employee's personnel file. Complaints
which are unfounded, exonerated or not sustained shall be maintained by the Internal Affairs
Unit apart from the employee's personnel file.

ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PANEL

1020.8.2
The Administrative Review Panel (ARP) will be comprised of a Bureau Commander
or captain, serving as chair, with a panel comprised of captains and/or lieutenants.
This panel will have both investigative and review/recommendation authority.
Review/recommendation responsibilities would include reviewing for thoroughness and
objectivity, and making recommendations as to finding and proposed discipline (Local 270
members will not include proposed discipline).

As part of the review/recommendation process, the Administrative Review Panel has certain
investigative responsibilities, which could include, in certain cases, directing the Internal
Affairs Unit to conduct additional investigation into a specific facet of the case.

The ARP may also direct employees to appear before the panel for specific questioning.
In such instances, the employee's rights and responsibilities would be as provided in other
areas of this policy.

ARP members will preserve the integrity of the process by maintaining the confidentiality of
the complaint and investigative case file.

The OPO will have the opportunity to make a recommendation for mediation
to the Chief of Police, prior to investigation.
In the event the department,
the complainant and the officer all agree to mediation, that process will be
utilized rather than sending the matter on for investigation. Assuming the
officer participates in good faith during the mediation process, the officer will
not be subject to discipline and no disciplinary finding will be entered against
the officer. Good faith means that the officer listens and considers the issues
raised by the complainant, and acts and responds appropriately. Agreement
with either the complainant or the mediator is not a requirement of good faith. In
the event an agreement to mediate is reached and the complainant thereafter
refuses to participate, the officer will be considered to have participated in good
faith.

Once any complaint is received by the Internal Affairs unit, it shall be submitted
to the chain of command for review per existing policy. When either the Chief
or her/his designee determines that the allegations warrant investigation, such
investigation shall be approved, and IA will initiate the investigative process.

Internal Affairs will notify the OPO of all administrative interviews on all
complaints of a serious matter (complaints that could lead to suspension,
demotion or discharge) and all complaints originating at the OPO. The OPO
may attend and observe interviews, and will be given the opportunity to ask
questions after the completion of questioning by the department. The OPO will
not participate in criminal investigations of department employees but will be
notified when the criminal case is concluded.

Upon completion of investigations , IA will forward a complete copy of the case
file to the OPO for review. The OPO will determine whether the investigation
was thorough and objective.

the review process,

As a part of
the OPO may conclude that additional
investigation is needed on issues deemed material to the outcome. If there is
any dispute between the assigned investigator(s) and the OPO regarding the
necessity, practicality or materiality of the requested additional investigation,
the Chief (or designee) will determine whether additional investigation will be
undertaken. If the OPO is not satisfied with the determination of the Chief, the
matter will be resolved by the Mayor, who's decision will be final. Once the
matter has been referred to and resolved by the Mayor, the investigation will be
completed consistent with the determination by the Mayor. After completion of
the additional investigation, or the conclusion that no further investigation will
be undertaken, the OPO will then certify whether or not, in the opinion of the
OPA, the internal investigation was thorough and objective. This determination
will be made within five business days. Once the above finding is entered in the
investigation, the OPO will not be involved further in the disciplinary process
in that case.

All disciplinary decisions will be made by the Chief (or designee).

The OPO will be provided a copy of any letter or other notification to an officer
informing them of actual discipline imposed as a result of an internal affairs
investigation or any Notice of Finding in the event that the complaint is not
sustained.

The OPO will be notified by IA within five business days of case closure of
all complaints of a Serious Matter and all complaints originated by the OPO.

In addition to the investigative process, the OPO will have unimpeded access
to all complaint and investigative files for auditing and reporting purposes. The
OPO shall not retain investigative files beyond one year and will return the same
to Internal Affairs for safekeeping. At all times and including, without limitation,
issuing written reports, the OPO will not release the name(s) of employees or
other individuals involved in incidents or investigations nor any other personally
identifying information. The OPO may make statistical observations regarding
the disciplinary results of sustained internal investigations, but shall not take

POSTING OF DISCIPLINARY ACTION

1020.8.5
Whenever any disciplinary action is taken which involves discipline beyond the level of a
formal letter of reprimand (e.g., suspension, demotion, or termination), the Chief of Police
may cause to be posted on the department's official bulletin boards a notification setting
forth the following: The name of the officer or employee being disciplined; a summary of
the facts and findings in the disciplinary process; the nature and extent of the discipline
imposed, with a summary of the rationale supporting that decision.

Seat Belts

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1022.1
The use of seat belts and other safety restraints significantly reduces the chance of death or
injury in case of a traffic collision. This policy establishes guidelines for seat belt and child
safety seat use to assure maximum operator and passenger safety, thus minimizing the
possibility of death or injury as a result of motor vehicle crashes. This policy will apply to all
employees operating or riding in department vehicles (RCW 46.61.688, RCW 46.61.687).

1022.2 WEARING OF SAFETY RESTRAINTS
All employees shall wear available, properly adjusted safety restraints when operating or
riding in department owned, leased, or rented vehicles and while operating or riding in
privately owned vehicles while on duty. The driver is responsible for ensuring all occupants,
including non-employees, in the vehicle he/she is operating are in compliance with this
policy.

It is the intent of this policy that all employees wear seat belts whenever possible however,
sworn officers may dispense with wearing safety restraints for specific tactical situations or
when it reasonably appears that, due to unusual circumstances, wearing a seat belt would
hinder rather than increase safety.

All non-employees occupying the front seat of a police vehicle shall be required to wear
available safety restraints.

All persons occupying the rear seat of a police unit equipped with seatbelts shall
wear available safety restraints if available unless physical conditions or officer safety
considerations would prevent such from being applied or dictate otherwise.

TRANSPORTING CHILDREN

1022.2.1
An approved child safety restraint system should be used for all children of age, size or
weight for which such restraints are required by law. In the event an appropriate approved
child safety restraint system is not available the child may be transported by sworn
personnel however the child should be restrained in a seat belt (RCW 46.61.687(1)).

The rear seat passenger area in cage-equipped vehicles has reduced clearance which may
interfere with the proper use of child safety restraint systems. Because of limited rear seat
clearance in these vehicles, children and child restraint systems should be properly secured
in the front seat according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Whenever a child is
transported in the front seat of a vehicle, the passenger side air bag should be deactivated
if possible. In the event this is not possible, alternative transportation should be considered.

TRANSPORTING PRISONERS

1022.3
Whenever possible, prisoners should be secured in the prisoner restraint system in the rear
seat of the patrol vehicle or, when a prisoner restraint system is not available, by safety belts
(when available) in a seated position. The prisoner restraint system is not intended to be a
substitute for handcuffs or other appendage restraints.

position is inoperable.

No person shall modify, remove, deactivate or otherwise tamper with the vehicle safety belts
except for vehicle maintenance and repair and not without the express authorization of the
Chief of Police.

Employees who discover an inoperable restraint system shall report the defect to the

Body Armor

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1024.1
The purpose of this policy is to provide law enforcement officers with guidelines for the
proper use of body armor.

POLICY

1024.2
It is the policy of the Spokane Police Department to maximize officer safety through the
use of body armor in combination with prescribed safety procedures. While body armor
provides a significant level of protection, it is not a substitute for the observance of officer
safety procedures.

ISSUANCE OF BODY ARMOR

1024.3
The Administrative Services supervisor shall ensure that body armor is issued to all officers
when the officer begins service at the Spokane Police Department and that, when issued,
the body armor meets or exceeds the standards of the National Institute of Justice.

The Administrative Services supervisor shall establish a body armor replacement schedule
and ensure that replacement body armor is issued pursuant to the schedule or whenever
the body armor becomes worn or damaged to the point that its effectiveness or functionality
has been compromised.

1024.3.1
Generally, the use of body armor is required subject to the following:

USE OF SOFT BODY ARMOR

(a) Officers shall only wear agency-issued or approved body armor.

(b) Officers shall wear body armor anytime they are in a situation where they could

reasonably be expected to take enforcement action.

(c) Officers may be excused from wearing body armor when they are functioning primarily
in an administrative or support capacity and could not reasonably be expected to take
enforcement action.

(d) Body armor shall be worn when an officer is working in uniform or taking part in

Department range training.

(e) An officer may be excused from wearing body armor when he/she is involved
in undercover or plainclothes work that his/her supervisor determines could be
compromised by wearing body armor, or when a supervisor determines that other
circumstances make it inappropriate to mandate wearing body armor.

(f)

The department encourages the wearing of body armor by any volunteer or person
engaging in a ride along in a department patrol vehicle.

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Extra Duty and Outside Employment

Misuse of authority: Employees shall not misuse the authority of their office while engaged
in extra duty or outside employment.

Duty status: An employee engaged in authorized extra duty employment of a police nature
is considered to be in an on duty status. Officers shall not engage in extra duty work if they
are on injured or light duty status with the department.

Cancellations: A committee consisting of a representative assigned by the Guild president
and the extra-duty employment coordinator will develop a procedure for cancellations of
extra-duty assignments.
If the committee cannot reach agreement, any dispute will be
resolved by the Guild president and Chief of Police.

Failure to report for duty:
If an employee fails to follow the established cancellation
procedure, the same procedures will apply that pertain to unexcused absence or tardiness
for regular duty. The employee working extra duty is on duty in the employ of the Spokane
Police Department under the contracted agreement through the department and as such
is subject to the same provisions as other duty assignments. Violations will be reported
through the Special Events chain of command.

Compensation to employees: Employees shall be compensated by the city and shall not
accept compensation directly from any extra duty employer, and shall accrue all benefits
in accordance with law and collective bargaining agreements. Officers shall not enter into
their own contracts for such services.

Use of city equipment: City equipment utilized by employees during extra duty employment
may be charged to the outside extra duty employer. Generally, police vehicles will be a
contract item, unless it is determined to be in the best interest of the City of Spokane.
The Special Events Office will determine the costs associated with the equipment and the
appropriateness of utilizing police vehicles during such employment.

Law enforcement obligation: Employees engaged in extra duty employment are expected
to discharge all duties of their office, to enforce all laws and ordinances, and to adhere to
all department polices and procedures.

Supervision: Whenever an outside extra duty employer requests four or more employees
to work an extra duty assignment, a supervisor may also be required to direct the
employees' activities. When employees are working at an extra duty assignment without
permitted supervision, the employees are responsible to the on duty Uniform Division Shift
Commander.

Volunteering of time: Officers are not allowed to donate time in uniform or of a law
enforcement nature, when that function is similar to duties performed for the Spokane
Police Department.

1040.2 OBTAINING APPROVAL
No member of this department may engage in any extra duty or outside employment without
first obtaining prior written approval of the Chief of Police. Failure to obtain prior written
approval for outside employment or engaging in outside employment prohibited by this
policy may lead to disciplinary action.

In order to obtain approval for extra duty and outside employment, the employee must
complete an Extra Duty or an Outside Employment Application which shall be submitted
to the employee's immediate supervisor. The application will then be forwarded through
channels to the Chief of Police for consideration.

procedure set forth in the employee's current collective bargaining agreement.

REVOCATION/SUSPENSION OF OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT

1040.2.2
AUTHORIZATIONS
Any extra duty or outside employment authorization may be revoked or suspended under
the following circumstances:

(a) Should an employee's performance at this department decline to a point where it is
evaluated by a supervisor as below acceptable standards, the Chief of Police may,
at his/her discretion, suspend or revoke any previously approved extra duty and/or
outside employment authorization(s). The suspension or revocation will stand for a
set period of time. At the completion of this set time, the employee may apply for
reinstatement of privileges. Satisfactory job performance and the recommendation of
the employee's immediate supervisor are required.

(b) Suspension or revocation of a previously approved extra duty and/or outside
employment authorization may be included as a term or condition of sustained

PEER ASSISTANCE TEAM

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1053.1
The mission of the Peer Assistance Team (P.A.T.) is to provide information and emotional
support to employees and their families when personal or professional problems may
affect them. Official interactions are confidential, providing it does not violate any law or
Department regulation. The P.A.T., hereafter known as the Team, may supplement the
Department psychologist. The Team is specifically trained for support (Critical Incident
Stress Management ,  CISM), but is not a substitute for mental health professionals.

A critical incident is defined as, "Any situation faced by personnel that causes them to
experience unusually strong emotional reactions which have the potential to interfere with
their ability to function either at the scene or later" (Jeffery Mitchell, Ph.D. and co- founder
of the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation).

CONFIDENTIALITY

1053.2
RCW 5.60.060 (6) (a) states, "A peer support group counselor shall not, without consent of
the law enforcement officer or firefighter making the communication, be compelled to testify
about any communication made to the counselor by the officer or firefighter while receiving
counseling. The counselor must be designated as such by the sheriff, police chief, fire
chief, or chief of the Washington state patrol, prior to the incident that results in counseling.
The privilege only applies when the communication was made to the counselor while acting
in his or her capacity as a peer support group counselor. The privilege does not apply if
the counselor was an initial responding officer or firefighter, a witness, or a party to the
incident which prompted the delivery of peer support group counseling services to the law
enforcement officer or firefighter."

Team members must inform Department members of the limits of their confidentiality and
consider potential role conflicts (e.g. supervisor providing peer support). Exceptions to
confidentiality may include the following:

•

•

•

•

Threats to self

Threats to others (specific)

Serious crimes

Child, spousal or elder abuse

Steering Committee requiring immediate action, or issues that can be easily resolved, will
be brought forward by the coordinator to the Chief or designee.

Work groups typically are made up from a cross-section of individuals, often directly
impacted by the identified problem. The number of individuals in a work group will vary
depending on the project. These individuals will be authorized to work on their projects
during shift hours at the approval of their supervisor. Scheduling conflicts will be brought
to the coordinator for resolution. Overtime will be pre-approved by the coordinator.

Policy

1060

Spokane Police Department
Policy Manual

Employee Speech, Expression and
Social Networking

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

1060.1
This policy is intended to address issues associated with employee use of social networking
sites and to provide guidelines for the regulation and balancing of employee speech and
expression with the needs of the Department.

Nothing in this policy is intended to prohibit or infringe upon any communication, speech or
expression that is protected or privileged under law. This includes speech and expression
protected under state or federal constitutions as well as labor or other applicable laws. For
example, this policy does not limit an employee from speaking as a private citizen, including
acting as an authorized member of a recognized bargaining unit or officer associations,
about matters of public concern, such as misconduct or corruption.

Employees are encouraged to consult with their supervisor regarding any questions arising
from the application or potential application of this policy.

APPLICABILITY

1060.1.1
This policy applies to all forms of communication including but not limited to film, video,
print media, public or private speech, use of all Internet services, including the World Wide
Web, e-mail, file transfer, remote computer access, news services, social networking, social
media, instant messaging, blogs, forums, video and other file-sharing sites.

POLICY

1060.2
Public employees occupy a trusted position in the community, and thus, their statements
have the potential to contravene the policies and performance of this department. Due to
the nature of the work and influence associated with the law enforcement profession, it is
necessary that employees of this department be subject to certain reasonable limitations
on their speech and expression. To achieve its mission and efficiently provide service to
the public, the Spokane Police Department will carefully balance the individual employee's
rights against the Department's needs and interests when exercising a reasonable degree
of control over its employees' speech and expression.

SAFETY

1060.3
Employees should consider carefully the implications of their speech or any other form of
expression when using the Internet. Speech and expression that may negatively affect the
safety of the Spokane Police Department employees, such as posting personal information
in a public forum, can result in compromising an employee's home address or family ties.
Employees should therefore not disseminate or post any information on any forum or
medium that could reasonably be expected to compromise the safety of any employee, an
employee's family or associates. Examples of the type of information that could reasonably
be expected to compromise safety include:

Disclosing a photograph and name or address of an officer who is working undercover.

Disclosing the address of a fellow officer.

Otherwise disclosing where another officer can be located off-duty.

Employee Speech, Expression and Social Networking

1060.4
PROHIBITED SPEECH, EXPRESSION AND CONDUCT
To meet the department's safety, performance and public-trust needs, the following is
prohibited unless the speech is otherwise protected (for example, an employee speaking
as a private citizen, including acting as an authorized member of a recognized bargaining
unit or officer associations, on a matter of public concern):

(a) Speech or expression made pursuant to an official duty that tends to compromise or
damage the mission, function, reputation or professionalism of the Spokane Police
Department or its employees.

(b) Speech or expression that, while not made pursuant to an official duty, is significantly
linked to, or related to, the Spokane Police Department and tends to compromise or
damage the mission, function, reputation or professionalism of the Spokane Police
Department or its employees.

(c)

Speech or expression that could reasonably be foreseen as having a negative impact
on the credibility of the employee as a witness. For example, posting statements or
expressions to a website that glorify or endorse dishonesty, unlawful discrimination or
illegal behavior.

(d) Speech or expression of any form that could reasonably be foreseen as having a
negative impact on the safety of the employees of the Department. For example,
a statement on a blog that provides specific details as to how and when prisoner
transportations are made could reasonably be foreseen as potentially jeopardizing
employees by informing criminals of details that could facilitate an escape or
attempted escape.

(e) Speech or expression that is contrary to the canons of the Law Enforcement Code of

Ethics as adopted by the Spokane Police Department.

(f)

Use or disclosure, through whatever means, of any information, photograph, video or
other recording obtained or accessible as a result of employment with the Department
for financial or personal gain, or any disclosure of such materials without the express
authorization of the Chief of Police or the authorized designee (RCW 9A.68.020).

(g) Posting, transmitting or disseminating any photographs, video or audio recordings,
likenesses or images of department logos, emblems, uniforms, badges, patches,
marked vehicles, equipment or other material that specifically identifies the Spokane
Police Department on any personal or social networking or other website or web page,
without the express authorization of the Chief of Police, or designee.

(h) Accessing websites for non-authorized purposes, or use of any personal
communication device, game device or media device, whether personally or
for personal purposes while on-duty, except in the following
department-owned,
circumstances:

1. When brief personal communication may be warranted by the circumstances

(e.g., inform family of extended hours).

2.

During authorized breaks; such usage should be limited as much as practicable
to areas out of sight and sound of the public and shall not be disruptive to the
work environment.

Employees must take reasonable and prompt action to remove any content, including
content posted by others, that is in violation of this policy from any web page or website
maintained by the employee (e.g., social or personal website).

Employee Speech, Expression and Social Networking

1060.4.1
UNAUTHORIZED ENDORSEMENTS AND ADVERTISEMENTS
While employees are not restricted from engaging in the following activities as private
citizens or as authorized members of a recognized bargaining unit or officer associations,
employees may not represent the Spokane Police Department or identify themselves in any
way that could be reasonably perceived as representing the Spokane Police Department
in order to do any of the following, unless specifically authorized by the Chief of Police:

(a) Endorse, support, oppose or contradict any political campaign or initiative.

(b) Endorse, support, oppose or contradict any social issue, cause or religion.

(c)

Endorse, support or oppose any product, service, company or other commercial entity.

(d) Appear in any commercial, social or nonprofit publication or any motion picture, film,

video, public broadcast or any website.

Additionally, when it can reasonably be construed that an employee, acting in his/her
individual capacity or through an outside group or organization (e.g. bargaining group), is
affiliated with this department, the employee shall give a specific disclaiming statement that
any such speech or expression is not representative of the Spokane Police Department.

Employees retain their right to vote as they choose, to support candidates of their choice
and to express their opinions as private citizens, including as authorized members of a
recognized bargaining unit or officer associations, on political subjects and candidates at
all times while off-duty. However, employees may not use their official authority or influence
to interfere with or affect the result of an election or a nomination for office. Employees are
also prohibited from directly or indirectly using their official authority to coerce, command or
advise another employee to pay, lend or contribute anything of value to a party, committee,
organization, agency or person for political purposes (5 USC § 1502).

PRIVACY EXPECTATION

1060.5
Employees forfeit any expectation of privacy with regard to e-mails, texts or anything
published or maintained through file-sharing software or any Internet site (e.g., Facebook,
MySpace) that
received or reviewed on any department
technology system.

is accessed,

transmitted,

The Department reserves the right to access, audit and disclose for whatever reason any
message, including attachments, and any information accessed, transmitted, received or
reviewed over any technology that is issued or maintained by the Department, including the
department e-mail system, computer network or any information placed into storage on any
department system or device.

This includes records of all key strokes or web-browsing history made at any department
computer or over any department network. The fact that access to a database, service
or website requires a user name or password will not create an expectation of privacy if
accessed through department computers or networks.

TRAINING

1060.6
Subject to available resources, the Department should provide training regarding employee
speech and the use of social networking to all members of the Department.
