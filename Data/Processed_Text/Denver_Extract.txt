POLICY: 

a. 

105.00  Use of Force Policy 

REV. 3-10 

The Denver Police Department recognizes the value of all human life and is committed to 
respecting human rights and the dignity of every individual, and the Constitutional right to be free 
from excessive force, whether deadly or not, by a law enforcement officer.  The use of force, 
especially force likely to result in serious bodily injury or death (including a firearm), is a serious 
action.  When deciding whether to use force, officers shall act within the boundaries of the United 
States and Colorado constitutions and laws, ethics, good judgment, this use of force policy, and 
all other relevant Denver Police Department policies, practices and training. With these values in 
mind, an officer shall use only that degree of force necessary and reasonable under the 
circumstances.  An officer may use deadly force in the circumstances permitted by this policy 
when all reasonable alternatives appear impracticable and the officer reasonably believes that the 
use of deadly force is necessary.  Officers should ensure that they do not engage in 
unreasonable actions that precipitate the use of force as a result of tactical, strategic, and 
procedural errors that place themselves or others in jeopardy. The reasonableness of a particular 
use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than 
with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.  The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for 
the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments, in circumstances that 
are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving, about the amount of force that is necessary in a 
particular situation.  The reasonableness inquiry in an excessive force case is an objective one; 
the question is whether the officers’ actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and 
circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation. 

It is important for officers to bear in mind that there are many reasons a suspect may be resisting 
arrest or may be unresponsive.  The person in question may not be capable of understanding the 
gravity of the situation.  The person's reasoning ability may be dramatically affected by a number 
of factors, including but not limited to a medical condition, mental impairment, developmental 
disability, physical limitation, language, drug interaction, or emotional crisis.  Therefore, it is 
possible that a person's mental state may prevent a proper understanding of an officer's 
commands or actions. In such circumstances, the person's lack of compliance may not be a 
deliberate attempt to resist the officer.  An officer's awareness of these possibilities, when time 
and circumstances reasonably permit, should then be balanced against the facts of the incident 
facing the officer when deciding which tactical options are the most appropriate to bring the 
situation to a safe resolution.

Policing requires that at times an officer must exercise control of a violent, assaultive, or resisting 
individual to make an arrest, or to protect the officer, other officers, or members of the general 
public from risk of imminent harm.  Officers may either escalate or de-escalate the use of force as 
the situation progresses or circumstances change.  Officers should recognize that their conduct 
immediately connected to the use of force may be a factor which can influence the level of force 
necessary in a given situation.  When reasonable under the totality of circumstances, officers 
should use advisements, warnings, verbal persuasion, and other tactics and recognize that an 
officer may withdraw to a position that is tactically more secure or allows an officer greater 
distance in order to consider or deploy a greater variety of force options.  When a suspect is 
under control, either through the application of physical restraint or the suspect's compliance, the 
degree of force should be de-escalated accordingly. 

Unnecessarily or prematurely drawing or exhibiting a firearm limits an officer’s alternatives in 
controlling a situation, creates unnecessary anxiety on the part of citizens, and may result in an 
unwarranted or accidental discharge of the firearm.  An officer’s decision to draw or exhibit a 
firearm should be based on the tactical situation and the officer’s reasonable belief there is a 
substantial risk that the situation may escalate to the point where deadly force may be justified.  
When an officer has determined that the use of deadly force is not necessary, the officer should, 
as soon as practicable, secure or holster the firearm. 

b. 

The Denver Police Department recognizes that the duties of a peace officer may require officers 
to use force.  The department will support the lawful use of reasonable and appropriate force by 
officers in the performance of duty.  Use of force that is not lawful, reasonable and appropriate will 
not be tolerated. Department Policy as well as relevant Federal, State, and Local laws shall 
govern use of force by officers. 

DENVER POLICE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS MANUAL 

105-1 

REV. 3-10 

The level of force applied must reflect the totality of circumstances surrounding the immediate 
situation.  The officer need only select a level of force that is within the range of "objectively 
reasonable" options.  Officers must rely on training, experience and assessment of the situation 
to decide an appropriate level of force to be applied.  Reasonable and sound judgment will dictate 
the force option to be employed. 

Officers may either escalate or de-escalate the use of force as the situation progresses or 
circumstances change.  When a suspect is under control, either through the application of 
physical restraint or the suspect's compliance, the degree of force shall be de-escalated 
accordingly. 

Officers who use force as described in the Colorado Revised Statutes or the Operations Manual 
of the Denver Police Department must immediately report the circumstances to a command or 
supervisory officer and comply with all reporting requirements. 

An officer who witnesses inappropriate, unnecessary, unreasonable or excessive use of force by 
another officer shall report it immediately to a command or supervisory officer. 

Officers who are off-duty and become involved in any use of force situation must report the 
circumstances to an on-duty Denver Police Department command or supervisory officer as soon 
as the situation is stabilized.  An exception to the requirement of reporting to an on duty 
supervisor or command officer may be granted by the Chief of Police for major events involving 
off duty officers.  If an exception is granted a supervisor or command officer working the event 
may be allowed to fulfill the reporting requirements. 

Officers are responsible to ensure that medical treatment is provided to any person who has been 
injured or alleges injury as a result of being subjected to the use of force.

STATE STATUTES

a. 

C.R.S. §18-1-707 states in the pertinent part:  Use of physical force in making an arrest or in 
preventing an escape: 

1. 

"(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) of this section, a peace officer is justified in 
using reasonable and appropriate physical force upon another person when and to the 
extent that he reasonably believes it necessary: 

To effect an arrest or to prevent the escape from custody of an arrested person 
unless he knows that the arrest is unauthorized; or 

To defend him self or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the 
use or imminent use of physical force while effecting or attempting to affect such 
an arrest or while preventing or attempting to prevent such an escape. 

2. 

A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force upon another person for a 
purpose specified in subsection (1) of this section only when he reasonably believes that 
it is necessary: 

a. 

b. 

a. 

b. 

To defend himself or a third person from what he reasonably believes to be the 
use or imminent use of deadly physical force; or 

To affect an arrest or prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he 
reasonably believes: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving the use or 
threatened use of a deadly weapon; or 

Is attempting to escape by the use of a deadly weapon; or 

Otherwise indicates, except through a motor vehicle violation, that 
he is likely to endanger human life or to inflict serious bodily injury 
to another unless apprehended without delay.  (The Denver Police 
Department policy on use of deadly force in this situation is more 
restrictive than state law – see OMS 105.05(5). 

3. 

Nothing in subsection (2)(b) of this section shall be deemed to constitute justification for 
reckless or criminally negligent conduct by a peace officer amounting to an offense 
against or with respect to innocent persons whom he is not seeking to arrest or retain 
custody. 

105-2 

DENVER POLICE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS MANUAL 

REV. 3-10 

4. 

For the purposes of this section a reasonable belief that a person has committed an 
offense means a reasonable belief in facts or circumstances which if true would in law 
constitute an offense.  If the believed facts and circumstances would not in law 
constitute an offense, an erroneous though not unreasonable belief that the law is 
otherwise does not render justifiable the use of force to make an arrest or to prevent an 
escape from custody.  A peace officer who is affecting an arrest pursuant to a warrant 
is justified in using the physical force prescribed in subsection (1) and (2) of this section 
unless the warrant is invalid and is known by the officer to be invalid." 

b. 

The community expects and the Denver Police Department requires that peace officers use only 
the force necessary to perform their duties.  The level of force applied must reflect the totality of 
circumstances surrounding the immediate situation.  The officer need only select a level of force 
that is necessary and within the range of “objectively reasonable” options.  Officers must rely on 
training, experience and assessment of the situation to decide an appropriate level of force to be 
applied.  Reasonable and sound judgment will dictate the force option to be employed.  Colorado 
law mandates, and holds an officer accountable to do so, in C.R.S. §18-8-803: which states in 
part: 

"(1)...a peace officer who uses excessive force in pursuance of such officer's law enforcement 
duties shall be subject to the criminal laws of this state to the same degree as any other citizen.” 

"(2)...'excessive force' means physical force which exceeds the degree of force permitted 
pursuant to 18-1-707 (Use of force in making an arrest or in preventing an escape). The use of 
excessive force shall be presumed when a peace officer continues to apply physical force in 
excess of the force permitted by section 18-1-707 to a person who has been rendered incapable 
of resisting arrest. " 

c. 

The law requires that an officer who witnesses another officer using excessive force must report it 
to a supervisor.  C.R.S. §18-8-802 states in part:

"(1)(a) A peace officer who... witnesses another peace officer... use physical force which exceeds 
the degree of physical force permitted pursuant to 18-1-707 [Use of force in making an arrest or 
in preventing an escape] must report such use of force to such officer's immediate supervisor.  

"(1)(c) Any peace officer who fails to report such use of force in the manner prescribed commits a 
class 1 misdemeanor... " 

(3) 

CASE LAW 

a. 

Colorado law does not require an officer to retreat from an attack rather than resorting to physical 
force.  A peace officer is expected to take appropriate action to handle a situation and is 
authorized to use the reasonable and appropriate force necessary to overcome resistance. The 
degree of force required may be different in different situations. (Boykin V. People, 22 CO. 496, 
45 P. 419). 

Law enforcement officers are permitted to use force to affect an arrest only to the extent that it is 
"objectively reasonable" under the circumstances (Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 397, 109 
S.Ct.1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443).

Definitions: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Reasonable Belief - When facts or circumstances the officer reasonably believes, knows, 
or should know; are such as to cause an ordinary and prudent police officer to act or 
think in a similar way under similar circumstances.     

Deadly Physical Force - That force, the intended, natural, and probable consequence of 
which is to produce death and which does, in fact, produce death. 

Bodily Injury - "Physical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical or mental condition." 

Serious Bodily Injury - "Bodily injury which, either at the time of the actual injury or at a 
later time, involves a substantial risk of death, a substantial risk of serious permanent 
disfigurement, a substantial risk of protracted loss or impairment of the function of any 
part or organ of the body, or breaks, fractures (to include breaks or fractures of hard 
tissue such as bone, teeth, or cartilage), or burns of the second or third degree."

Psychological Intimidation - Non-verbal cues in attitude, appearance, demeanor or 
posture that indicates an unwillingness to cooperate or a threat. 

Verbal Non-Compliance - Verbal responses indicating an unwillingness to comply with 
officer's directions or threat to injure a person. 

Passive Resistance - Physical actions that do not prevent the officer's attempt to control, 
for example, a person who remains in a limp or prone position. 

Defensive Resistance - Physical actions that attempt to prevent officer's control including 
flight or attempt to flee, but do not involve attempts to harm the officer. 

Active Aggression - A threat or overt act of an assault, coupled with the present ability to 
carry out the threat or assault, which reasonably indicates that an assault or injury to any 
person is imminent. 

Aggravated Active Aggression - Deadly force encounter. 

Psychological Intimidation, Verbal Non-Compliance and Passive Resistance usually do 
not involve conduct sufficient to support criminal charges related to resistance. 

The reasonableness of an officer’s use of force under the Fourth Amendment requires 
careful attention to the totality of the facts and circumstances known by the officer prior to 
using force, including: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

The severity of the crime at issue and  

Whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officer(s) or 
others and 

Whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by 
flight. 

Each situation is unique.  Sound judgment and the circumstances of each situation will 
dictate the force option the officer deems necessary.  Depending on the circumstances, 
officers may find it necessary to escalate or de-escalate the use of force.  It is not the 
intent of this policy to require officers to attempt to exhaust each option before moving to 
the next, so long as the level of force used is reasonable and appropriate under the 
circumstances. 

The level of force employed must be commensurate with the threat posed by the suspect 
and the seriousness of the immediate situation.  It is recognized and understood that 
circumstances are fluid and may change rapidly.  Officers should rely on their training, 
experience, and assessment of the situation, to decide the appropriate level of force. 

Requesting a CIT officer:  Whenever an officer learns, through his or her observations 
or otherwise, that a person with whom the officer is dealing may be a mentally ill, 
developmentally disabled, or emotionally disturbed individual, the officer will, if time and 
circumstances reasonably permit and dictate, contact dispatch and request that a CIT 
officer respond to the scene.  If time and circumstances reasonably permit, officers will 
use distance, time, verbal tactics, or other tactics, to de-escalate the situation when 
dealing with such persons.  When a CIT officer arrives on the scene, he or she should be 
the primary officer responsible for coordinating negotiations with the mentally ill, 
developmentally disabled, or emotionally disturbed individual unless determined 
otherwise by the CIT officer or a superior officer. 

Edged Weapons:  When confronted by a suspect armed with a deadly weapon, 
including edged weapons, an officer should weigh the totality of the facts and 
circumstances of each situation.  Practical considerations may include, but are not limited 
to, the proximity of the suspect to the officer(s) and other persons, how rapidly the 
circumstances are evolving, and the use of force options that may be necessary, 
appropriate, and available.

Use of Force/Control Options 

105-4 

DENVER POLICE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS MANUAL 

REV. 4-15 

Officers should recognize that, when reasonable to do so with safety to officers and other 
persons in the vicinity, disengagement, repositioning, cover, concealment, barriers or 
retreat, although not required by law, may be a tactically preferable police response to a 
confrontation. 

The value of all human life should be appropriately weighed in the decision process.  
Above all, the safety of the public and the officer must be the overriding concern 
whenever the use of force is considered. 

e. 

The following list of use of force/control options is not intended to suggest the order in which the 
various categories of force should be used in any specific situation:

DUTY TO REQUEST MEDICAL ATTENTION

a. 

Any time there is an injury or an alleged injury as a result of force used by department personnel 
or an officer encounters an individual with obvious injuries and the circumstances of the 
encounter coupled with the nature of the injuries are such that the person may claim the injuries 
resulted from the contact with the officer, the involved officer(s) shall: 

Visually examine any person claiming injury, request medical attention and immediately 
notify a supervisor.  When an individual is struck with a less lethal weapon or an impact 
tool/device, or is subjected to the carotid compression technique or sprayed with a 
chemical agent, an ambulance shall be called to the scene of the incident to examine the 
person at the earliest and safest opportunity.  Medical personnel will determine whether 
further medical attention is required. 

Any prisoner suffering from any illness, injury or other condition that requires medical 
attention, such as the ingestion of narcotics or other harmful substances, will be sent to 
Denver Health Medical Center for treatment. 

It is the policy of the Denver Sheriff’s Department to refuse custody of injured prisoners 
unless accompanied by reports indicating that they have been examined or treated, or 
have refused to submit to examination or treatment at Denver Health Medical Center or 
another appropriate medical facility. 

Violent behavior may mask dangerous medical conditions; therefore, detainees shall be 
continuously monitored and provided with medical treatment if needed. 

105.03 

Less Lethal Force and Control Options 

(1) 

POLICY 
The primary duty of police officers is to protect the public, themselves and other officers. Less lethal force 
and control options may assist officers in performing these duties, but are not intended to substitute for 
the use of deadly force when it is reasonable and necessary.  There is neither a requirement nor an 
expectation that officers attempt to use or exhaust less lethal options in situations requiring the use of 
deadly force.

LESS LETHAL OPTIONS 
The Denver Police Department authorizes the use of Electronic Restraints Devices (ERD)/TASER, 
Pepper Ball deployment systems, twelve (12) gauge and forty (40) mm specialty impact munitions to be 
carried by certain officers in their normal duty assignments. 

(3) 

LESS LETHAL WEAPONS DEFINITIONS 

Less lethal:  A concept of planning and force application which meets an operational or tactical 
objective, with less potential for causing death or serious injury than conventional more lethal 
police tactics. 

Less lethal weapon:  Any apprehension or restraint device approved for carry, which when used 
as designed and intended has less potential for causing death or serious injury than conventional 
police lethal weapons. Less lethal weapons include Electronic Restraints Devices (ERD/TASER), 
Pepper Ball deployment systems, less lethal twelve (12) gauge shotguns and forty (40) mm 
projectile systems and others as approved by the Chief of Police. 

Less lethal officer: An officer trained in the principles of less lethal force and the use of less lethal 
weapons.  One who is authorized by the department to carry and deploy one or more of the 
weapons in the performance of their duties. 

Less lethal shotgun: Department approved twelve (12) gauge shotgun with a cylinder bore 
eighteen-inch (18) barrel.  The shotgun, except those approved by the Chief of Police for use by 
Metro/Swat, has a high visibility stock and fore-end and is equipped with rifle sights. 

Twelve (12) gauge beanbag projectile:  Department approved and issued.  The beanbag 
projectile is a lead-shot-filled fabric bag designed to be non-penetrating and to deliver its kinetic 
energy over a broad surface area.

Forty (40) mm Launcher:  Either a single round or multi-launcher, department approved, with 
fixed stock and rifle barrel. 

Forty (40) mm Projectile:  Only department approved and issued specialty impact 
munitions may be deployed. 

ERD/TASER: Advanced Taser ERD (Electronic Restraint Device) which uses an electrical 
signal to temporarily override the motor and sensory nervous system and directly control 
the skeletal muscles.  This causes an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue, 
allowing the Taser to physically debilitate a target regardless of pain tolerance or mental 
focus. 

Pepper Ball System:  Air-Powered launch device and projectiles that are plastic spheres 
filled with powdered Oleoresin Capsicum (OC).  Projectiles burst on impact and release 
OC.  Pepper Ball projectiles subdue by strongly irritating the nose, lungs, and breathing.  
Response to inhaling Pepper Ball projectile OC powder varies greatly among individuals. 
In most cases, the symptoms last for a few minutes.  The Pepper Ball can deliver 
projectiles with enough kinetic energy to produce abrasions, bruises, and/or welts. 

Cycle:  A single application of the ERD/Taser’s electrical impulse, regardless of duration, 
which causes electro-muscular disruption.

LESS LETHAL WEAPON PROCEDURES 

The authorization to carry a less lethal weapon is a privilege and can be revoked at any time, for any 
reason by the officer's commander with approval of the officer's deputy chief or higher. 

Officers will be selected, trained and certified as less lethal officers and alternates.  Only less 
lethal officers and alternates are authorized to display, carry or deploy any less lethal weapon.  
When vacancies occur among the ranks of less lethal officers, they will be filled by designation of 
an officer from the alternate pool.  Selection of less lethal officers and alternates will be based on 
the following criteria: 

b. 

Officers must be selected by their commanding officer and approved by their deputy chief. 

Officers must attend and pass a mandatory training course, an annual in-service course 
and periodic qualification conducted by Firearms Section personnel.  The formal updated 
training curriculum and list of qualified officers will be kept on file at the Training Bureau.

Less lethal certified officers who fail to qualify with their firearm two or more quarters in a 
twelve (12) month period shall be removed from the less lethal program.  It is the 
responsibility of the officer and the supervisor of the Firearms Section to notify the 
officer's commander and the officer's deputy chief verbally and in writing of the failure to 
qualify as required by this section. 

Violations of this policy may result in revocation of the privilege to carry a less lethal 
weapon. 

All departmental less lethal weapons not deployed in the field will be maintained in a 
police facility, in a locked cabinet or room designed specifically for the secure storage of 
only less lethal weapons. 

Less lethal weapons will be issued to qualified officers by a designated armory officer or 
supervisor at the beginning of each shift and returned at the end of the officer's shift to an 
armory officer or a supervisor. 

The Pepper Ball system may be issued for general patrol use and Field Force Squad or 
Zone commanders may also issue Pepper Ball deployment systems and less lethal 
shotguns or forty (40) mm projectile systems to qualified personnel assigned to each 
squad. 

All available less lethal weapons will be issued at the beginning of each shift provided 
sufficient numbers of qualified officers are on duty and returned at the end of the officer's 
shift to an armory officer or a supervisor. 

Qualified officers may not decline to be issued, carry, or deploy less lethal weapons. 

Each unit will designate a supervisor to perform the following maintenance on the unit’s 
less lethal inventory on a twice-yearly basis on the date of the time change: 

Inspect all ERD/Tasers, Pepper Ball launchers, and less-lethal shotguns.  Any 
defective weapons will be delivered to the Less Lethal Coordinator in the  
Firearms Section. 

Perform a data download from all ERD/Tasers in inventory.  The data disks will 
be delivered to and retained by the Internal Affairs Division. 

Adjust the time in the ERD/Taser’s internal clock to reflect the regional time. 

Officers are responsible for the care and handling of less lethal weapons to the same 
degree and under the same conditions as other weapons.  The less lethal weapons 
shall be safely handled, carried, and stored while on and off duty. 

Officers or supervisors will determine when less lethal weapons are to be deployed.  
Officers deploying a less lethal weapon usually serve as cover officers only.  Less lethal 
officers shall not perform any other duties, such as searching or handcuffing, until their 
weapon is secured.  Planning and communication between officers and supervisors is 
important when making deployment and strategy decisions. 

The less lethal shotgun is to be carried in the trunk of the police car, either in its 
case or in a dedicated rack if the vehicle is so equipped, with an empty chamber, 
the safety on and magazine loaded with four (4) rounds of less lethal 
ammunition. 

The ERD will be carried on the belt in an approved holster, worn on the side 
opposite the firearm.  When not worn, the ERD will be secured in a locked 
vehicle, not visible to passers-by. 

The Firearms Section will maintain a list of department approved ERD holsters, 
and all ERD/Tasers will be carried in a holster from the approved list. 

Pepper Ball guns may be authorized by Field Force Commanders for use during 
field force operations and major crowd control events.  Subject to availability 
certified supervisors or officers may carry the Pepper Ball gun while on patrol.

Pepper Ball System Deployment 

Use of the Pepper Ball projectile shall be considered a use of force and must meet the 
requirements of all department policies and procedures and Colorado Revised Statutes. 

Acceptable uses of the Pepper Ball projectile may include: 

To incapacitate a combative or physically resistive person whose conduct rises 
at least to the level of Defensive Resistance.  The purpose is to neutralize the 
person to the point they can be safely controlled and taken into custody.  
(Defensive Resistance is defined as physical actions that attempt to prevent an 
officer's control including flight or attempt to flee, but do not involve attempts to 
harm the officer). OR  

In situations when its use is likely to prevent an officer or a third person from 
being injured, OR

To incapacitate a suicidal person who cannot be safely controlled with other 
force options, OR 

When ordered by the field force commander or other command officer in crowd 
control or riot situations. 

c. 

Unless deadly force is warranted, an officer shall not intentionally deploy the Pepper 
Ball projectile as follows: 

To the head, eyes, throat, neck, breasts of a female, genitalia, or spinal column. 

To a pregnant female, if the officer has knowledge of the pregnancy. 

On or in an open wound if the officer has knowledge of the open wound. 

Officers shall communicate to other officers that they are about to discharge a less lethal 
weapon prior to its use or clearly and audibly announce the same to officers in the 
immediate area unless urgent circumstances prevent this from occurring. 

Immediate evaluation by medical personnel is required to determine the degree of injury 
suffered by the suspect.  This medical check shall be documented on the Use of Force 
report and the GSS&C.  If the prisoner is jailed, the officer will notify detention facility 
personnel that a less lethal weapon was used.

Less lethal ERD/TASER Deployment 

Use of an Electronic Restraint Device (ERD/TASER) shall be considered a use of force 
and must meet the requirements of all department policies and procedures and the 
Colorado Revised Statute. 

b. 

Acceptable uses of the ERD/TASER include: 

To incapacitate a combative or physically resistive person; whose conduct rises 
at least to the level of Active Aggression.  The purpose is to neutralize the 
person to the point they can be safely controlled and taken into custody.  This 
use of force option becomes necessary when other force options would be 
inappropriate or ineffective under the circumstances.  (Active Aggression: A 
threat or overt act of an assault, coupled with the present ability to carry out the 
threat or assault, which reasonably indicates that an assault or injury to any 
person is imminent.), OR 

In situations when its use is likely to prevent an officer or a third person from 
serious bodily injury, OR 

To incapacitate a suicidal person who can’t be safely controlled with other force 
options. 

c. 

Unless deadly force is warranted, officers shall not intentionally deploy the ERD/TASER as 
follows:

To the head, eyes, throat, neck, chest, breast(s) of a female, genitalia, or spinal column. 

a. 

b. 

The point of aim (meaning the placement of the red laser dot) shall be the muscles of the upper 
abdominal area just below the sternum.  

Probe strikes in any restricted area shall be specifically noted in the Use of Force Report, 
with an articulation of the specific suspect action(s) that may have caused the probe to 
strike the restricted area.  

To a pregnant female, unless deadly force is warranted and if the officer has knowledge of the 
pregnancy.

On an open wound, if the officer has knowledge of the open wound. 

d. 

Officers will not use the ERD/Taser in the following situations: 

When the suspect has come in contact with or is in an environment containing flammable gases 
or liquids. 

Drug houses where ether or other flammable chemicals are suspected. 

To prevent a suspect from swallowing evidence. 

To terminate a foot chase unless the suspect’s actions rise to the level of Active Aggression.  

When the subject is in a position where a fall may cause serious bodily injury or death. 

Where the suspect is in water of sufficient depth that the suspect may drown once 
incapacitated. 

Where its use will cause the suspect to lose control of a motor vehicle unless they can 
articulate compelling reasons. 

When the subject is holding a firearm, unless they can articulate compelling reasons. 

When the subject is at the extremes of age or physically disabled, unless they can articulate 
compelling reasons. 

In a situation where deadly force is clearly justifiable, unless sufficient cover is present and is 
capable of providing deadly force (Lethal Cover) to protect the officers and or civilians as 
necessary. 

As a tool of coercion or punishment.  Officers will not activate the Taser against a suspect more 
than the minimum number of times necessary to safely take the suspect into custody, and the 
suspect should be secured as soon as practical, while experiencing electro-muscular 
disruption, in order to minimize the number of cycles. 

On a handcuffed prisoner, unless the officer can articulate an immediate need to stop a threat 
or action that will cause serious injury or death to the officer or another person. 

No officer shall playfully or maliciously display, or intentionally misuse the ERD/Taser. See OMS

Impact Tool/Device - General Guidelines: 

If a person resists non-violently (Defensive Resistance), the impact tool/device may be used only 
to apply come along/escort compliance holds.  A person, who remains non-violent, will not 
intentionally be struck with the impact tool. 

If a person forcefully resists and/or attacks an officer or other person, an officer is permitted to 
strike the person with an impact tool/device, provided the officer uses reasonable care to confine 
such strikes and power levels, to areas of the body which, if struck, are not intended or likely to 
cause serious bodily injury. 

The head and neck shall not be intentionally struck with the impact tool/device, unless the officer 
is justified in using deadly force. 

Impact tools/devices shall be maintained in serviceable condition and shall not be modified, 
altered or fitted with any unauthorized add-on device in any way that is not approved in writing by 
the department.  They may be marked with the officer's serial number but shall not be marked or 
adorned in any other fashion. 

5. 

Defective, broken, or altered impact tools shall not be carried. 

a. 

An officer who discovers an impact tool/device that is unserviceable must immediately 
cease carrying the item and, if issued by the department, promptly submit a written 
request for replacement through the chain of command. 

DENVER POLICE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS MANUAL 

105-13 

REV. 3-10 

All officers shall receive the designated training on each impact tool or device 
that they intend to carry before carrying the tool or device on or off duty.  The 
mandatory training will be recorded in the officer's permanent training record. 
Division and bureau commanders will insure that the appropriate training is 
current and documented for all officers under their commands. 

c. 

Use of Impact Tools or Devices to Apply Deadly Force: 

1. 

An impact tool or device is generally used as a "compliance tool" to overcome 
non-deadly force exercised by a person resisting the officer's authority.  However, in 
certain circumstances the impact tool or device can be properly used to apply greater 
force up to and including deadly physical force.  Refer to CRS §18-1-707(2) for the 
circumstances under which deadly physical force can be used.  

2. 

Examples of reasonable deadly force applications of impact tool or devices include: 

Controlling a suspect who has disarmed an officer and the officer reasonably 
believes that the suspect is about to use the firearm against the officer or 
another. 

Controlling a suspect who is armed with a knife or other deadly weapon and 
due to the suspect's close proximity, the officer reasonably believes that the 
suspect is threatening the officer with imminent death or serious bodily injury. 

(6) 

Additional Force Options

a. 

Orcutt Police Nunchaku (OPN) 

b. 

Chemical Agent 

The Orcutt Police Nunchaku is an authorized safety tool primarily used for arrest control 
and self-defense.  Other brands, designs, or types of nunchaku are not authorized. 

Officers must first successfully complete a basic level OPN course authorized by the 
Denver Police Department prior to carry or use of the OPN in the performance of duties. 

Officers must successfully complete refresher training as required by the department. 
Officers failing to re-certify as required shall no longer carry or use the OPN in the 
performance of duties. 

If the OPN is used to strike a subject or injury occurs, whether or not an arrest is made, a 
Use of Force Report is required, in accordance with OMS 105.01(1). 

Chemical agents provide an excellent force option in certain situations. 

Chemical agents may be used when reasonable and justified in the following 
situations: 

To prevent an injury to an officer or a third person. 

To ward off threatening dogs and other animals. 

To subdue a person who is threatening or attempting physical harm to himself 
or another. 

Against subjects resisting arrest. 

To quell rioting. 

Against subjects interfering with an arrest. 

Any situation where the officer can clearly articulate the need to deploy this device. 

Authorization for use of a chemical agent, other than personal/individual issue, may not 
ordinarily be given by an officer below the rank of sergeant.  The use of a chemical agent 
for crowd control or riot control must ordinarily be authorized by an officer of the rank of 
lieutenant or higher, except in the event of an emergency were the officer in charge of a 
field situation cannot reasonably contact higher authority.

personnel that a less lethal weapon was used. 

REV. 2-15 

c. 

Carotid Compression Technique 

Only officers who have been trained by the Denver Police Department in the application 
of the carotid compression technique may utilize this force option.  Application of the 
carotid compression technique shall be considered a use of force and must meet the 
requirements of all department policies and procedures and the Colorado Revised 
Statutes.  

2. 

Acceptable application of the carotid compression technique: 

a. 

To incapacitate a combative or physically resistive person whose conduct rises 
to the level of Aggravated Active Aggression.  The purpose is to subdue the 
person to the point they can be safely controlled and taken into custody.  This 
use of force option becomes necessary when other force options would be 
inappropriate or ineffective under the circumstances.  (Aggravated Active 
Aggression - Deadly force encounter) 

Officers should be mindful not to apply direct pressure to either the front of the throat, 
back of the neck or head area either through compounded body weight, or direct 
pressure from a knee or arm in an effort to gain physical control of the person.  
Application of such pressure can cause unintended serious bodily injury or even death. 

An immediate medical evaluation by paramedics is required to determine, if any, the 
degree of injury sustained by the suspect.  This medical check shall be documented on 
the Use of Force report and any other charging document.  If the arrestee is jailed, the 
officer will notify detention facility personnel that a carotid compression technique was 
applied. 

Police Service Dogs

d. 

 

Policy 
The mission of the Denver Police Department is to deliver high quality public safety services so all 
people may share a safe and healthy environment.  The department, in partnership with the 
community, will endeavor to achieve our mission by utilizing the most modern and effective 
practices and methods.  One of those effective practices is the utilization of a well trained 
professional Police Canine Unit.  The police canine provides many valuable services including 
criminal apprehension, evidence and contraband detection, locating missing persons, and public 
relations activities. 

1. 

Canines assigned to the Metro/SWAT Bureau will be available to assist in searches, 
crowd control, tracking, explosive and narcotic detection, security at scenes of major 
crimes or disasters, in addition to regular patrol duties and special assignments. 

a. 

b. 

c. 

d. 

If an officer needs a canine and none are on duty, the dispatcher shall be 
notified.  The canine supervisor will be contacted and will make the determination 
of which canine officer to send. 

Canine handlers will be in complete charge and responsible for their dogs’ 
deployment, regardless of the ranking officer on the scene.  Canine handlers will 
determine the appropriate utilization of their dogs. 

When it is believed a suspect may be armed with a weapon likely to cause injury 
or death to the police service dog, the handler may exercise his/her discretion 
before deploying the dog. 

Any conflicts in utilization shall be reported in writing, via the chain of command, 
to the commanders of the officers involved, as soon as possible. 

2. 

A police service dog may be used to perform a search or apprehension in a reasonable 
manner as determined by the handler and in compliance with all applicable laws and 
statutes regarding police use of force, the Denver Police Department Use of Force Policy, 
and the Canine Unit Policies and Procedures when the following conditions exist: 

DENVER POLICE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS MANUAL 

105-15 

REV. 4-15 

When there is probable cause to believe the suspect has committed a crime or is 
a danger to themselves or others, and 

When the suspect is actively evading efforts to take them into custody and the 
use of a canine would reduce risk to officers or the public. 

3. 

Risk to Third Parties:  In using police service dogs, the canine handler shall exercise 
reasonable care to avoid unnecessary risk of injury to persons who are not the subject of 
a search or apprehension. 

 

4. 

Should a police service dog injure any person: 

The arrest scene and any criminal suspects will be immediately secured. 

The canine officer/handler will immediately request medical assistance. 

The injury will be reported on a Report of Use of Force, DPD 12, and in 
accordance with the requirements of OMS 105.01, Use of Force Procedures. 

Injuries caused by the police service dog to persons who were not the subject of 
the search will be reported on a Use of Force Report.

Shooting By and/or of Police Officers

 

(1) 

When any law enforcement officer, regardless of agency or department, discharges a firearm as a result 
of contact with a person, whether or not a death or wounding occurs, officers shall immediately notify the

(5) 

The investigation of a shooting, by or of, a peace officer is a cooperative endeavor between the Denver 
Police Department and the Denver District Attorney's Office.  The investigation is under the command of 
the Commander of the Major Crimes Division or designee.  Officers and investigators shall use all 
appropriate investigative methods and techniques including, but not limited to, the following:

Completely process and document the crime scene using diagrams, photographs and video 
recordings in accordance with crime scene protocols outlined in OMS 301.01. 

Investigators shall document statements as soon as practical following the shooting.  Methods of 
documentation include those written, audio recorded, or video recorded at the discretion of the 
investigative command officer in consultation with the District Attorney.  The interview order is 
generally civilian witnesses first, followed by officer witnesses.  The interview(s) of the involved 
officer, those officers discharging a firearm, usually occur last. 

The officer involved in the shooting may have an attorney present for legal assistance.  
Investigators will advise the involved officer in accordance with the "Officer Advisement in Police 
Shootings" form (DPD 759).  The "Miranda Warning", Internal Affairs Division "Garrity 
Advisement," or ordered statements under City Charter C5.73-6, will generally not occur unless 
evidence supporting a crime or serious department rule violation exists. 

The Commander of the Internal Affairs Division (IAD) or designee will act as a liaison for the 
Office of the Independent Monitor (OIM) during the investigation of officer incidents involving 
members of the Denver Police Department, Denver Sheriffs Department and the Denver Fire 
Department’s arson investigators.  The Internal Affairs Division will participate in the investigation 
only at the request of the Commander of the Major Crimes Division or designee, or the Chief of 
Police.  This participation only involves those cases where information or evidence supports there 
is a suspected crime or serious rule violation. 

Refer all media inquiries to the Commander of the Major Crimes Division or designee, generally, 
the Public Information Officer. 

The command officer in charge of the investigation will prepare, or cause the preparation, of an 
After Action Report (DPD286) and distribute the report as appropriate prior to going off duty. 

The criminal charge filing decision for a police shooting case is solely the responsibility of the 
Denver District Attorney's Office.  Officers shall not publicly speculate about the decision.  The 
District Attorney will inform the Chief of Police, in writing, of the decision following the completion 
of the criminal investigation and a thorough review of the case.  The District Attorney bases the 
review and filing decision on the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and does 
not address administrative remedies which have a different legal level of proof. 

When death occurs the officer will be removed from any line duty assignment, pending the results 
of an administrative review. 

The officer’s command will contact Police Psychological Services as soon as possible after the 
incident and schedule an appointment for the officer.  The commander, with approval from their 
deputy chief, may arrange excused days for the officer until the police psychologist has met with 
the officer and made a verbal recommendation to the commander as to when the officer can 
return to duty.  The purpose of the Psychological Services appointment is not to investigate the 
officer’s actions or assess his/her fitness for duty. 

In cases with extenuating circumstances, temporary or permanent assignment changes may 
occur.

When death results, from any officer involved use of force, an in custody death or death which 
occurred as a direct result of police action and the incident is investigated by Major Crimes as a 
critical incident, the commander will follow the same procedures listed above in (6)b.   

Absolute confidentiality exists and the officer has the option of not discussing anything he/she 
does not wish to discuss. The officer may include others in this interview, such as family 
members, fellow officers, or members of the Critical Incident Trauma Team (CITT). 

The commanding officer of the officers involved in a shooting incident will notify the officers of the 
above provisions. Additionally, the commanding officer will provide Psychological Services with 
the names of those officers whom they must contact.  If after one week Psychological Services 
has not been able to contact the officer, Psychological Services will notify the commanding officer 
who shall provide for such arrangements.  No other exchange of information will occur without the 
express written consent of the officer before the interview. 

In the event of a civil lawsuit against the City and County of Denver and the officer, the City 
Attorney's office will provide legal representation.  Exceptions include when the officer acts 
outside of the scope of his/her employment or neglects to notify the Civil Liability Unit of the 
potential action for a lawsuit. 

105.05 

Discharge of Firearms 

 

Officers shall not discharge any firearm in the performance of their duties except as authorized by law and 
the rules, regulations and procedures of the Denver Police Department. 

All members of the Denver Police Department shall safely handle firearms while performing on-duty 
assignments and at all times while carrying/handling firearms while off-duty. 

When all reasonable alternatives appear impractical, a law enforcement officer may resort to the lawful 
use of firearms under the following conditions when he/she reasonably believes that it is necessary.  
When feasible, it is necessary, to give some warning before engaging in the use of deadly force.  If 
possible, identify yourself as a police officer, give the command you want followed, and state your 
intention to shoot.  

To defend him/herself, or a third person from what he/she reasonably believes to be the use or 
imminent use of deadly physical force (C.R.S. §18-1-707); or 

To affect an arrest, or to prevent the escape from custody of a person whom he/she reasonably 
believes: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving the use or threatened use of a 
deadly weapon; or 

Is attempting to escape by the use of a deadly weapon; or 

Otherwise indicates, except through a motor vehicle violation, that he is likely to 
endanger human life or to inflict serious bodily injury to another unless apprehended 
without delay. (C.R.S. §18-1-707).   

 

4. 

The following definitions shall apply to all of OMS 105.04(3) a. and b: 

REASONABLE BELIEF:  When facts or circumstances the officer reasonably 
believes, knows, or should know, are such as to cause an ordinary and 
prudent police officer to act or think in a similar way under similar 
circumstances. 

DEADLY PHYSICAL FORCE:  That force, the intended, natural, and 
probable consequence of which is to produce death and which does, in fact, 
produce death. 

SERIOUS BODILY INJURY:  Bodily injury which, either at the time of the 
actual injury or at a later time, involves a substantial risk of death, a 
substantial risk of serious permanent disfigurement, a substantial risk or 
protracted loss or impairment of the function of any part or organ of the body, 
or breaks, fractures (to include breaks or fractures of hard tissue such as 
bone, teeth, or cartilage) or burns of the second or third degree.

c.          A law enforcement officer may also engage in the lawful use of firearms under the following 

conditions:   

 

To kill a dangerous animal or one that humane treatment requires its removal from 
further suffering and alternative methods of disposition are impractical. 

To participate in authorized training at a target range. 

To participate in any legitimate sporting activity.  

(4) 

Officers will not discharge firearms under the following conditions: 

At another person unless the circumstances are such that the officer would be justified under the 
law if the shot killed the person. 

Where there is likelihood of serious injury to persons other than the person to be apprehended. 

As a warning or attention shots.   

Solely to protect property. 

 (5) 

Moving vehicles 

Firing at moving vehicles: Firing at a moving vehicle may have very little impact on stopping the 
vehicle.  Disabling the driver may result in an uncontrolled vehicle, and the likelihood of injury to 
occupants of the vehicle (who may not be involved in the crime) may be increased when the 
vehicle is either out of control or shots are fired into the passenger compartment.  An officer 
threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall, if feasible, move out of the way rather than discharging 
a firearm.  Officer(s) shall not discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupant(s) in 
response to a threat posed solely by the vehicle unless the officer has an objectively reasonable 
belief that: 

The vehicle or suspect poses an immediate threat of death or serious physical injury to 
the officer or another person and 

The officer has no reasonable alternative course of action to prevent death or serious 
physical injury. 

Firing from a moving vehicle:  Accuracy may be severely impacted when firing from a moving 
vehicle, and firing from a moving vehicle may increase the risk of harm to officers or other 
citizens.  Officers should not fire from a moving vehicle except in self defense or defense of 
another from what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly 
physical force.  

Above all, the safety of the public and the officer must be the overriding concern when the use of force is 
considered.

Use of Force Review Board 

The Chief of Police has established a Use of Force Review Board which will examine all incidents where 
serious injury or death results from any officer-involved use of force, all firearm discharges by active 
members of the department, except those incidents described in OMS 105.04(3) d. & e, any in-custody 
death and any incident as directed by the Chief of Police.  The board is investigative in nature and is 
responsible for making recommendations on administrative justification, Internal Affairs investigations, 
department policy modifications, training, and commendations.  The board is empowered to classify a 
case as in or out of policy. 

The board may refer a case to the involved officer’s commander for consideration of a 
commendation. 

The board may refer a case to the Tactics Review Board. 

The Use of Force Board review of any case where a person has been injured or killed will be 
scheduled after the completion of the criminal investigation and the Chief of Police has received a 
written decision from the District Attorney stating whether or not criminal charges will be filed.  
The responsibility for notifying the Use of Force Board that the case is ready for review rests with 
the commanding officer of the Internal Affairs Division or his designee.

placed in the involved officer's Internal Affairs Division file subject to purge at periods specified by 
the Chief of Police. 

If the Use of Force Board has concluded that any Departmental Policy, Procedure, Rule or 
Regulation appears to have been violated, the Chief of Police will be notified of this fact in writing.  
The Use of Force Board will document the areas which it considers to be deficient, and forward a 
copy if its findings to the Commander of the Internal Affairs Division.  The Internal Affairs Division 
will be responsible for investigating the specific points the Use of Force Board has found to be 
deficient.  At the conclusion of the investigation, the case will be resubmitted to the Use of Force 
Review Board for an administrative finding.  Sustained cases will then be processed and 
forwarded to the Conduct Review Division.  As in all other disciplinary matters, final authority and 
responsibility rests with the Chief of Police. 

If there is a question regarding tactics used in the incident, the Use of Force Board may forward 
the case to the Tactics Review Board for an opinion.  Any recommendations made by the Tactics 
Review Board regarding additional training, or policy changes will be forwarded to the Chief of 
Police.

Firearms - Requirements and Inspection (Revised 11/2014)

Officers will equip themselves with firearms of suitable caliber and manufacture as will meet requirements 
set forth by the Chief Firearms Officer with the approval of the Chief of Police. 

Prior to purchasing a firearm for official use, officers may obtain a copy of the Firearms Purchase 
Authorization, DPD 30.  The use of this form eliminates the requirement to submit to the CBI 
background check required by Colorado Law.  Officers are to submit the form to THEIR 
commanding officers for signature.  Commanders are to authorize purchases only for officers 
under their commands.  The form is then given to the gun dealer prior to the purchase of the 
weapon. 

(2) 

The Chief Firearms Officer, with the approval of the Chief of Police, shall prepare a list of firearms which 
are approved for carry.  The list shall be updated as necessary by the Chief Firearms Officer, with the 
approval of the Chief of Police; the DPD 30 form will be revised with the current list.  

The five (5) categories of authorized firearms are as follows: 

Uniform:  This category lists the handguns approved for uniform carry.  Officers shall carry only 
one (1) approved handgun and holster visibly displayed.  All approved handguns in the uniform 
category are also approved for all other categories. 

Plain Clothes:  This category lists the handguns approved for carry by officers in plain clothes 
while on duty.  These handguns are also acceptable off-duty. 

Administration:  This category lists the handguns approved for carry by non-uniform 
administrative officers while on duty.  The administrative status of a Denver Police Department 
officer’s assignment will be determined by the deputy chief in charge of the officer’s 
assignment. 

Off-duty/back-up:  This category lists the handguns approved for off-duty carry and back-up.  
All handguns approved for uniform, plain clothes and administrative categories are also 
authorized for off duty or back-up use. 

Utility: This category lists firearms approved for carry while performing specialized functions. 
The unit commander will determine the necessity for utilization of this category. 

(3) 

Inspection of Firearms.  All firearms must be inspected, function tested, and approved by the Firearms 
Section prior to being carried either on or off duty. 

An annual inspection of all firearms will be required.  Officers are prohibited from carrying any 
firearm which has not been inspected, approved and recorded within the previous twelve (12) 
calendar months.  Each firearm will be inspected and fired for qualification once in each calendar 
year. 

Firearms found to be defective during an inspection will be brought to the attention of the officer 
owning the firearm.  The officer will have such defects repaired.  The repaired firearm will be 
submitted to a Firearms Section officer for inspection and approval prior to being carried. 

c. 

Qualification must be accomplished prior to carrying the firearm.

(4) 

Repairs to firearms.  Officers assigned to the Firearms Section are authorized to repair certain approved 
firearms. The following applies to in-house repairs. 

The firearm(s) in question must be an approved firearm. 

Department owned firearms shall not be altered in any way, except by Firearms Section 
personnel or by order of the Chief of Police. 

The officer reserves the right to have personally owned firearms repaired by any person or firm of 
choice.  The cost of such repairs shall be borne by the officer.  After repair or alteration by any 
person or firm other than the Firearms Section the firearm must be submitted to the Firearms 
Section for inspection and approval prior to being carried. 

In the event that needed repairs are of such nature that factory repair is required, personally 
owned firearms shall be returned by the officer to the factory for repair at the officer’s expense.
