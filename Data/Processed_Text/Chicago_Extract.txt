DEPARTMENT POLICY

This directive sets forth Department policy regarding sworn members’ and detention aides’ use of force.

A.

B.

C.

D.

A.

B.

Sanctity of Human Life. The Department’s highest priority is the sanctity of human life. In all aspects
of their conduct, Department members will act with the foremost regard for the preservation of human
life and the safety of all persons involved.

Public Cooperation. A strong partnership with the public is essential for effective law enforcement.
Inappropriate or excessive uses of force damage that partnership and diminish the public trust that is
a cornerstone of policing in a free society.

Core Principle. The Chicago Police Department seeks to gain the voluntary compliance of subjects,
when  consistent  with  personal  safety,  to  eliminate  the  need  to  use  force  or  reduce  the  force  that  is
needed.

Assessing  Uses  of  Force.  The  Chicago  Police  Department  recognizes  that  Department  members
are  often  forced  to  make  split-second  decisions—in  circumstances  that  are  tense,  uncertain,  and
rapidly  evolving—about  the  amount  of  force  that  is  necessary  in  a  particular  situation.  These
decisions must therefore be judged based on the totality of the circumstances known by the member
at the time and from the perspective of a reasonable Department member on the scene, in the same
or  similar  circumstances,  and  not  with  the  benefit  of  20/20  hindsight.  Nothing  in  this  policy  requires
members to take actions, or fail to take actions, that unreasonably endanger themselves or others.

NOTE:

Nothing in this policy precludes the legally mandated oversight or assessment of a
Department member's use of force consistent with the procedures established in this
policy.

Definition  of  Force.  Force  is  defined  as  any  physical  contact  by  a  Department  member,  either
directly or through the use of equipment, to compel a subject’s compliance.

Use of Force: Objectively Reasonable, Necessary, and Proportional. Department members may
only use force that is objectively reasonable, necessary, and proportional in order to ensure the safety
of a member or third person, stop an attack, make an arrest, control a subject, or prevent escape.

1.

Objectively  reasonable.  The  main  issue  in  evaluating  every  use  of  force  is  whether  the
amount  of  force  used  by  the  officer  was  objectively  reasonable  in  light  of  the  totality  of  the
circumstances faced by the officer on the scene. Reasonableness is not capable of precise
definition  or  mechanical  application.  Factors  to  be  considered  by  the  officer  include  but  are
not limited to:

a.

b.

c.

whether the subject is posing an imminent threat to the officer or others.

the risk of harm, level of threat or resistance presented by the subject.

the subject’s proximity or access to weapons.

III.

Necessary.  Department  members  will  use  only  the  amount  of  force  required  under  the
circumstances to serve a lawful purpose.

Proportional.  Department  members  will  use  only  the  force  that  is  proportional  to  the  threat,
actions, and level of resistance offered by a subject. This may include using greater force or a
different type of force than that used by the subject. The greater the threat and the more likely
that the threat will result in death or serious physical injury, the greater the level of force that
may be necessary to overcome it. When or if the subject offers less resistance, however, the
member will decrease the amount or type of force accordingly.

De-escalation. Members will use de-escalation techniques to prevent or reduce the need for
force  when  it  is  safe  and  feasible  to  do  so  based  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstances.  This
includes continually assessing the situation and modifying the use of force as circumstances
change  and  in  ways  that  are  consistent  with  officer  safety.  Examples  of  de-escalation
techniques include but are not limited to:

exercising persuasion and advice, and providing a warning prior to the use of force.

determining  whether  the  member  may  be  able  to  stabilize  the  situation  through  the
use of time, distance, or positioning to isolate and contain a subject.

requesting  additional  personnel  to  respond  or  make  use  of  specialized  units  or
equipment including crisis-intervention-team trained officers.

5.

Prohibitions.

The use of excessive force, unwarranted physical force, or unprofessional conduct by
a Department member is prohibited and will not be tolerated.

Department  members  are  prohibited  from  using  force  based  on  bias  against  a
person’s race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, disability, gender, gender identity, sexual
orientation,  or  any  other  protected  characteristic  as  outlined  in  the  Department
directive  entitled  "Prohibition  Regarding  Racial  Profiling  and  Other  Bias  Based
Policing."

Force used as punishment or retaliation is prohibited.

Force used in response to a person’s lawful exercise of First Amendment rights (e.g.,
protected speech, lawful demonstrations, and filming police activity) is prohibited.

NOTE:

First  Amendment  rights  are  not  absolute  and  are  subject  to
reasonable  time,  place,  manner  restrictions.  Further  guidance  may
"The  First
be 
Amendment and Police Actions."

the  Department  directive  entitled 

found 

in 

Additional  procedures.  For  further  procedures  on  de-escalation,  the  principles  of  Force
Mitigation,  and  when  force  is  authorized,  Department  members  will  refer  to  the  Department
directive entitled “Force Options.”

C.

Use of Deadly Force: Necessary to Prevent Death or Great Bodily Harm. The following additional
policies apply to the use of deadly force:

Definition of Deadly Force. Deadly force is force by any means that is likely to cause death or
great bodily harm. It includes but is not limited to:

firing of a firearm in the direction of the person to be arrested.

firing of a firearm at a vehicle in which the person to be arrested is riding.

intentional striking of a subject’s head with an impact weapon.

application of a chokehold, defined as applying direct pressure to a person’s trachea
(windpipe) or airway (front of the neck) with the intention of reducing the intake of air.

the subject's actions are immediately likely to cause death or great bodily harm to the
member or others unless action is taken; and

the subject has the means or instruments to cause death or great bodily harm; and

the subject has the opportunity and ability to cause death or great bodily harm.

Last Resort. The use of deadly force is a last resort that is permissible only when necessary
to protect against an imminent threat to life or to prevent great bodily harm to the member or
another  person.  Consistent  with  this  requirement,  a  sworn  Department  member  may  use
deadly force only when such force is necessary to prevent:

death or great bodily harm from an imminent threat posed to the sworn member or to
another person.

an  arrest  from  being  defeated  by  resistance  or  escape,  where  the  person  to  be
arrested poses an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm to a sworn member
or another person unless arrested without delay.

Fleeing Persons. Deadly force may not be used on a fleeing person unless the subject poses
an imminent threat, as defined above.

Sworn members will, whenever possible, identify themselves as police officers prior to using
deadly  force,  unless  identification  would  jeopardize  the  safety  of  the  member  or  others  or
compromise the integrity of an investigation.

A sworn member is justified in using deadly force to stop a dangerous animal only when the
animal  reasonably  appears  to  pose  an  imminent  threat  to  the  safety  of  the  sworn  member,
another person, or another animal and no reasonably effective alternatives appear to exist.

Firing warning shots.

Firing at subjects whose actions are only a threat to themselves (e.g., attempted suicide).

Firing solely in defense or protection of property.

Firing  into  crowds.  However,  this  prohibition  does  not  preclude  the  use  of  deadly  force
directed at a specific person who is near or among other people, but the use of deadly force
in  such  circumstances  is  only  permitted  in  the  limited  circumstances  when  such  force  is
reasonably  necessary  to  prevent  death  or  great  bodily  harm  to  the  sworn  member  or  to
another  person,  and  no  reasonable  alternative  exists.  In  such  circumstances,  the  use  of
deadly  force  is  permissible  only  if  the  member  has  identified  the  appropriate  target  prior  to
discharging  the  firearm  and  has  taken  reasonable  precautions  to  ensure  that  people  other
than the target will not be struck.

Firing into buildings or through doors, windows, or other openings when the person lawfully
fired  at  is  not  clearly  visible,  unless  directed  at  a  specific  location  and  such  force  is
reasonably  necessary  to  prevent  death  or  great  bodily  harm  to  the  sworn  member  or  to
another  person.  In  such  circumstances,  the  use  of  deadly  force  is  permissible  only  if  the
member  has  identified  the  appropriate  target  prior  to  discharging  the  firearm  and  has  taken
reasonable precautions to ensure that people other than the target will not be struck.

Firing at or into a moving vehicle when the vehicle is the only force used against the sworn
member  or  another  person,  unless  such  force  is  reasonably  necessary  to  prevent  death  or
great bodily harm to the sworn member or to another person.

NOTE:

When  a  vehicle  is  the  only  force  used  against  a  member,  the  member  will
not place themselves in the path of the moving vehicle and will make every
effort to move out of the path of the vehicle.

D.

Prohibitions on the use of firearms. The use of firearms in the following ways is prohibited:

IV.

MEDICAL ATTENTION

A.

Once  the  scene  is  safe  and  as  soon  as  practical,  whenever  an  individual  is  injured,  complains  of
injury, or requests medical attention, Department members:

will immediately request appropriate medical aid for the injured person, including contacting
emergency  medical  services  (EMS)  from  the  Chicago  Fire  Department  via  the  Office  of
Emergency Management and Communications (OEMC).

may provide appropriate medical care consistent with their training to any individual who has
visible  injuries,  complains  of  being  injured,  or  requests  medical  attention.  This  may  include
providing first aid and/or arranging for transportation to an emergency medical facility.

Members will treat injured persons, whether another officer, a member of the public, or a subject, with
dignity and respect.

V.

DUTY TO INTERVENE AND REPORT

Ensure  Compliance.  All  Department  members  are  obligated  to  ensure  compliance  by  themselves
and other members with Department regulations, policies, and the law.

Intervention, Notifying Superiors, Supervisory Intervention. A Department member who directly
observes  a  use  of  force  that  is  excessive  or  otherwise  in  violation  of  this  directive  will  contact  a
supervisor  as  soon  as  practicable.  Except  in  extraordinary  circumstances,  the  member  will  act  to
intervene on the subject's behalf. Such action will include, but is not limited to, verbally intervening to
try to stop the violation. If the member is a supervisor, he or she will issue a direct order to stop the
violation.

Written  Reporting  Obligation.  Consistent  with  the  Department  directive  entitled  “Complaint  and
Disciplinary Procedures,” Department members who have knowledge of the use of force against a
subject  in  violation  of  this  directive  will  submit  an  individual  written  report  to  a  supervisor  before
reporting off duty on the day the member becomes aware of the misconduct.

Retaliation  Prohibited.  The  Department  prohibits  any  form  of  retaliation  against  a  Department
member for :

reporting a use of force that is allegedly in violation of this directive, or

cooperating with any internal investigation of the complaint.

E.

Accuracy and Candor. Department members will be responsible at all times:

for truthfully and completely describing the facts and circumstances concerning any incident
involving the use of force by Department members.

for articulating the specific facts to explain the member’s own decision to employ a particular
use of force.

outlines  the  various  force  options  and  the  circumstances  in  which  they  are  authorized  when
Department members are met with resistance or threats.

describes Force Mitigation and its role in the Department’s response to all incidents.

Sanctity of Human Life. All incidents will be resolved with the foremost regard for the preservation of
human life and the safety of all persons involved. A member's decision to use force will be made in
accordance with G03-02, "Use of Force."

De-Escalation.  Department  members  will  use  de-escalation  techniques  to  prevent  or  reduce  the
need for force when it is safe and feasible to do so based on the totality of the circumstances. This
includes continually assessing the situation and modifying the use of force as circumstances change
and in ways that are consistent with officer safety.

When  Force  is  Authorized.  Department  members'  use  of  force  must  be  objectively  reasonable,
necessary  under  the  circumstances,  and  proportional  to  the  threat,  actions,  and  level  of  resistance
offered by a subject.

The  Department  expects  members  to  develop  and  display  the  skills  and  abilities  that  allow  them  to
regularly  resolve  confrontations  without  resorting  to  force,  or  by  using  only  the  amount  of  force
required under the circumstances.

Sworn  members  will,  whenever  possible,  identify  themselves  as  police  officers  prior  to  taking  any
police  action,  unless  identification  would  jeopardize  the  safety  of  the  member  or  others  or
compromise the integrity of an investigation.

F.

Members will continually assess situations and determine:

if any use of force is necessary;

the authorized force option based on the totality of the circumstances;

if  the  seriousness  of  the  situation  requires  an  immediate  response  or  whether  the  member
can employ other force options or the Force Mitigation Principles; and

if  the  level  of  force  employed  should  be  modified  based  upon  the  subject's  actions  or  other
changes  in  the  circumstances.  The  level  of  force  shall  be  de-escalated  immediately  as
resistance decreases, provided that the member remains in control and as safety permits.

G.

Members  will  modify  their  force  in  relation  to  the  amount  of  continued  resistance  offered  by  the
subject.

As the subject offers less resistance, the member will immediately lower the amount or type
of force used.

As the subject increases resistance, the member may increase the amount or type of force
used.

H.

If  the  Department  member  is  responding  to  an  incident  involving  persons  in  need  of  mental  health
treatment, the member will act in accordance with the Department directive entitled “Responding to
Incidents Involving Persons In Need Of Mental Health Treatment.”

III.

PRINCIPLES OF FORCE MITIGATION

During  all  use  of  force  incidents,  when  it  is  safe  and  feasible  to  do  so,  Department  members  will  use  the
principles of Force Mitigation to ensure effective police-public encounters. The concepts of Force Mitigation
include:

A.

Continual Communication

Members  will  attempt  to  use  verbal  control  techniques  to  avoid  or  minimize  confrontations
prior to, during, and after the use of physical force.

When  it  is  safe  and  feasible,  members  will  exercise  persuasion,  advice,  instruction,  and
warning prior to the use of physical force.

Members should attempt to establish and maintain verbal communication in all police-public
encounters  and  to  continually  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  that  communication.  Members
will:

when  practical,  establish  and  maintain  one-on-one  communication  where  only  one
member speaks at a time.

vary  the  level  of  assertiveness  of  their  communication  depending  on  the  type  of
police-public  encounter  and  whether  a  serious  crime  has  been  committed  or  life  or
property is at risk.

4.

When  encountering  noncompliance  to  lawful  verbal  direction,  members  are  not  required  to
immediately use force. When it is safe and feasible to do so, members will consider:

adjusting their verbal communication.

if feasible, allowing a different member to initiate verbal communications.

NOTE:

Members should refrain from giving simultaneous directions to avoid
any potential conflicts.

requesting  additional  personnel  to  respond  or  making  use  of  the  specialized  units
and equipment available through a notification to OEMC.

NOTE:

Members  will,  when  practical,  request  assistance  from  specialized
units, including a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) trained officer.

B.

Tactical Positioning

When  it  is  safe  and  reasonable  to  do  so,  members  should  make  advantageous  use  of
positioning,  distance,  and  cover  by  isolating  and  containing  a  subject  and  continuously
evaluating the member's positioning, subject's actions, and available force options.

Members  should  attempt  to  establish  a  zone  of  safety  for  the  security  of  the  responding
members and the public. The zone of safety is where:

the incident scene has been secured;

the scene can be continually monitored or adjusted to maintain safety;

the subject does not pose a continuing threat to Department members or the public;

the subject can be continually monitored; and

the subject can be contained throughout the incident.

Members should provide for a safe and effective route for additional requested resources to
approach the incident scene.

C.

Time as a Tactic

When it is safe and reasonable to do so, members should use time as a tactic.

In  order  to  use  time  as  a  tactic,  a  zone  of  safety  should  be  established  for  the  security  of
responding members and the public.

Using time as a tactic may:

permit  the  de-escalation  of  the  subject's  emotions  and  allow  the  subject  an
opportunity to comply with the lawful verbal direction;

allow for continued communication with the subject and the adjustment of the verbal
control techniques employed by the members; and

allow  for  the  arrival  of  additional  members,  special  units  and  equipment,  and  other
tactical resources.

IV.

LEVEL OF FORCE

A.

Cooperative Subject: a person who is compliant without the need for physical force. The following
force options are authorized when dealing with a cooperative subject:

1.

Police Presence

2.

Verbal Response

Police presence is established through identification of authority and proximity to the
subject. Mere police presence may result in compliant behavior by the subject.

Police presence alone is the only force option authorized for use with subjects who
are fully cooperative.

Verbal response consists of persuasion, advice, instruction, and warning in the form
of verbal statements or commands that may result in compliant behavior.

Whenever it is safe and feasible, members will attempt to de-escalate confrontations
by  utilizing  verbal  control  techniques  prior  to,  during,  and  after  the  use  of  physical
force.

B.

Resister:  a  person  who  is  uncooperative.  Resisters  are  further  subdivided  into  two  categories  (1)
passive resister; and (2) active resister.

1.

Passive  Resister:  a  person  who  fails  to  comply  (non-movement)  with  verbal  or  other
direction.  In  addition  to  the  force  options  listed  in  Item  IV-A  for  Cooperative  Subjects,  the
following force options are authorized when dealing with a passive resister:

a.

Holding Techniques

Holding techniques include a firm grip, grabbing an arm, wristlocks, and come-along
holds (i.e., escort holds that are not elevated to compliance techniques), as well as
any combination of the above.

b.

Compliance Techniques

Compliance techniques are designed to amplify nonimpact pressure and increase the
potential for controlling a subject.

The  goal  of  applying  joint  manipulation  and  pressure  point  techniques  to
pressure  sensitive  areas  of  the  body  is  to  elicit  and  maintain  established
control through non-impact pain compliance.

NOTE:

Members will not use a compliance technique that restricts
blood  flow  to  carotid  arteries,  causing  the  subject  to  lose
oxygen to the brain.

Using  a  Long  Range  Acoustic  Device  (LRAD)  to  emit  high-decibel  focused
sound  waves 
the  LRAD  requires
authorization from the Superintendent or his or her designee.

to  cause  discomfort.  Any  use  of 

NOTE:

The  LRAD  is  not  considered  a  use  of  force  when  used  to
deliver  verbal  messages  or  warnings  at  a  decibel  level  not
intended to cause discomfort.

c.

Control Instruments

Control instruments are designed to amplify nonimpact pressure in order to increase
the  potential  for  controlling  a  subject.  These  instruments  are  placed  mainly  on  the
sensors of the skin covering bone. Control instruments are tools (e.g., baton) applied
to joints and pressure sensitive areas of the body with non-impact pressure.

d.

Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Spray and Capsaicin II Powder Agent Deployment

Oleoresin  capsicum  and  Capsaicin  II  powder  are  highly  inflammatory  agents  that
occur  naturally  in  cayenne  peppers.  The  use  of  OC  spray  and  Capsaicin  II  powder
agent is intended to increase control by disorienting the subject and interfering with
the subject's ability to resist arrest.

(1)

Oleoresin  capsicum  is  only  authorized  to  use  against  the  two  types  of
passive resisters described below AND only after the required authorization
is received. No other use of oleoresin capsicum is authorized against passive
resisters.

(a)

(b)

Occupant(s) of a motor vehicle who is passively resisting arrest and
only after obtaining authorization from an on-scene supervisor of the
rank of sergeant or above.

Noncompliant groups, crowds, or an individual taking part in a group
or  crowd  (e.g.,  demonstrations,  celebrations),  only  after  obtaining
authorization from the Superintendent or his or her designee.

(2)

Capsaicin II powder agent deployment is an authorized force option against
passive resisters who are part of noncompliant groups or crowds only when
used  for  area  saturation  and  only  after  obtaining  authorization  from  the
Superintendent or his or her designee.

NOTE:

Only  Department-issued  Capsaicin 
II  powder  agent
projectiles  and  launchers  may  be  used  and  only  after  the
member  has  received  Department-authorized  training  in
their safe handling and deployment.

(3)

For  further  guidance  on  the  use  of  OC  spray,  members  will  refer  to  the
Department  directive  entitled  "Oleoresin  Capsicum  (OC)  Devices  and
Other Chemical Agent Use Incidents."

This  type  of  resistance  includes  but  is  not  limited  to  evasive  movement  of  the  arm,

A  subject  who  is  attempting  to  avoid  apprehension  and  who  fails  to  comply  with  a
sworn member's orders to reveal themselves is considered an Active Resister.

In addition to the force options authorized in Items IV-A and IV-B-1 for Cooperative
Subjects  and  Passive  Resisters,  the  following  force  options  are  authorized  when
dealing with an active resister:

(1)

Stunning

Stunning  is  diffused-pressure  striking  or  slapping  the  subject  to  increase
control  by  disorienting  the  subject  and  interfering  with  his  or  her  ability  to
resist.

(2)

Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Spray

Oleoresin  capsicum  is  an  authorized  force  option  against  active  resisters.  If
the  active  resister  is  part  of  a  group  or  crowd,  OC  is  authorized  only  after
obtaining approval from the Superintendent or his or her designee.

(3)

Canines Used by Canine Handlers

A canine under the control of a canine handler is an authorized force option
when used consistent with the provisions of the Department directive entitled
"Canine Use Incidents."

(4)

Taser

(a)

(b)

(c)

The Taser is a device used to control and subdue a subject through
the  application  of  electrical  impulses  that  override  the  central
nervous system and cause uncontrollable muscle contractions.

Only  Department-issued  Tasers  may  be  used  and  only  after  the
member  has  received  Department-authorized  training  in  their  safe
handling and deployment.

For further guidance on the use of a Taser, members will refer to the
Department directive entitled "Taser Use Incidents."

(d)

Using the Taser to drive stun an active resister is prohibited.

C.

Assailant: a subject who is using or imminently threatening the use of force against another person.
Assailants are further subdivided into two categories.

1.

The  subject's  actions  are  aggressively  offensive  with  or  without  weapons  and  may  cause
physical injury.

a.

b.

This type of assailant is one who places a member in fear of a battery and includes
advancing on the member in a threatening manner or closing the distance between
the assailant and the member, thereby reducing the member's reaction time.

Included in this category of assailant may  be a  subject who is armed with a deadly
weapon and the subject fails to disarm, thereby increasing the likelihood the subject's
actions likely to cause physical injury.

c.

In  addition  to  the  force  options  authorized  in  Items  IV-A  and  IV-B  for  Cooperative
Subjects and Resisters, the following force options are authorized when dealing with
this type of assailant:

(1)

Direct Mechanical

Direct mechanical techniques are forceful, concentrated striking movements
such  as  punching  and  kicking,  or  focused  pressure  strikes  and  pressures.
These  techniques  can  be  combined  with  take-downs  or  pins  against  the
ground or other objects.

(2)

Impact Weapons

Impact  weapons  are  designed  to  establish  control  by  means  of  applying
mechanical  impact  to  a  subject  in  order  to  disable  elements  of  his  or  her
musculoskeletal  structure. Members will avoid  the use  of flashlights, radios,
firearms, or any item not specifically designed as an impact weapon, unless
reasonably necessary and no other practical options are available.

(3)

Impact Munitions

(a)

Impact munitions are projectiles intended to impact and incapacitate
a  potentially  dangerous  subject  from  a  safe  distance,  thereby
reducing  resistance  and  gaining  compliance  while  reducing  the
probability of serious injury or death.

i)

ii)

Capsaicin  II  powder  agent  projectiles  fired  from  a  powder
agent deployment system is considered an impact munition.

The  use  of  Capsaicin  II  powder  agent  projectiles  as  an
impact  munition 
the
Superintendent or his or her designee.

authorization 

requires 

from 

(b)

Only  Department-issued  impact  munitions  may  be  used  and  only
after  the  member  has  received  Department-authorized  training  in
their safe handling and deployment.

2.

The  subject's  actions  will  likely  cause  death  or  serious  physical  injury  to  the  Department
members or to another person. In addition to the force options authorized in Items IV-A, IV-B,
and  IV-C-1  for  Cooperative  Subjects,  Resisters,  and  Assailants,  firearms  and  other  deadly
force responses are authorized when dealing with this type of assailant.

a.

b.

c.

For  further  guidance  on  when  the  use  of  deadly  force  is  authorized,  members  will
refer to Department directive "Use of Force."

For  further  guidance  on  the  use  of  firearms,  members  will  refer  to  Department
directive "Firearms Discharge Incidents Involving Sworn Members."

Chokeholds are only justified as a use of deadly force.

(1)

(2)

(3)

A  chokehold  is  defined  as  applying  direct  pressure  to  a  person's  trachea
(windpipe) or airway (the front of the neck) with the intention of reducing the
intake of air.

Holding and control techniques involving contact with the neck, but which are
not intended to reduce the intake of air, are not defined as chokeholds.

Under  no  circumstances  will  a  member  use  a  chokehold,  or  any  lesser
contact  with  the  neck  area,  to  prevent  the  destruction  of  evidence  by
ingestion.

PURPOSE

POLICY

This directive outlines the policy governing the field deployment of Department Taser devices.

A.

B.

C.

D.

E.

F.

Sanctity of Human Life. All incidents will be resolved with the foremost regard for the preservation of
human life and the safety of all persons involved. A member's decision to utilize a Taser will be made
in accordance with G03-02, "Use of Force."

De-Escalation.  Members  will  use  de-escalation  techniques  to  prevent  or  reduce  the  need  for  force
when  it  is  safe  and  feasible  to  do  so  based  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstances.  This  includes
continually  assessing  the  situation  and  modifying  the  use  of  force  as  circumstances  change  and  in
ways that are consistent with officer safety.

When  Use  is  Authorized.  Department  members'  use  of  a  Taser  must  be  objectively  reasonable,
necessary  under  the  circumstances,  and  proportional  to  the  threat,  actions,  and  level  of  resistance
offered  by  a  subject.  Consistent  with  G03-02-01,  "Force  Options,"  Department  members  are
authorized to use a Taser only for an active resister or assailant, and only for the purpose of gaining
control of and restraining the subject.

Prohibitions. Although Tasers are considered less-lethal weapons, they can cause serious injury or
death. For the safety of everyone involved, the following additional restrictions apply:

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

Explosion  Hazards.  Tasers  will  not  be  used  in  any  environment  that  contains  potentially
flammable, volatile, or explosive material.

Removing Barbs. Members will not remove Taser barbs embedded in the subject's flesh.

Multiple  Tasers  on  One  Subject.  Members  will  not  use  multiple  Tasers  against  the  same
subject,  unless  a  member  already  attempted  to  use  a  Taser  against  the  subject  but  the
probes did not make contact with the subject.

No  Drive  Stuns.  Drive  stunning  is  prohibited  unless  the  subject  is  defined  as  an  assailant
and other force options are not readily available or would otherwise be ineffective.

Persons Vulnerable to Injury from Tasers. Tasers will not be used on a subject who is at a
greater  risk  of  serious  injury  or  death  from  taser  use,  unless  the  subject  is  defined  as  an
assailant and other force options are not readily available or would otherwise be ineffective.
People who are at a greater risk of serious injury or death from Taser use include, but are not
limited to, children, pregnant women, and the elderly.

Justify  Separate  Uses  of  Force.  An  initial  Taser  application  and  each  subsequent  application  of
Taser  energy  (either  re-energizing  a  discharged  cartridge  with  the  ARC  switch  or  discharging  a
second  cartridge)  must  be  individually  justified  and  documented  on  the  Tactical  Response  Report
(TRR) as a separate use of force.

Department  members  will  refer  to  the  Department  directive  entitled  "Taser  Devices"  for  specific
training,  maintenance,  assignment,  and
including 
procedures  on  Taser  device  protocols 
accountability.

III.

CONDITIONS ON THE FIELD DEPLOYMENT OF A TASER

A.

Field Deployment of a Taser. A field deployment of a Taser is:

any probe discharged, including accidental discharges;

any initiation of the ARC switch to re-energize the subject;

the use of a spark display during a use of force incident; or

the use of the device by physical contact to drive stun a subject.

NOTE:

It is not considered a field deployment of a Taser if the Taser and/or laser pointers
were merely displayed but no electricity was displayed (warning arc) or discharged.

B.

Authorized Manner of Use. A member who is discharging a Taser device will, when possible:

give  verbal  commands  and  warnings  prior  to,  during,  and  after  deployment  of  the  Taser,
including informing other Department members on the scene of the deployment of the Taser.

aim for subject’s back below the neck area. When frontal shots are necessary, aim for lower
center mass (below chest or area of the heart) and legs.

NOTE:

It  is  recommended  that  Department  members  deploy  the  Taser  to  the
subject's back whenever possible.

discharge  probes  when  the  member  is  within  18  feet  of  the  subject  (and  ideally  when  the
member is within 7 to 15 feet of the subject).

use only one five-second energy cycle (the default length of an energy cycle when the Taser
trigger is pressed and released) and reassess the situation before any additional cycles are
given or cartridges are discharged.

if the subject is incapacitated, immediately attempt to restrain the subject while he or she is
incapacitated.

if the subject has been exposed to three, five-second energy cycles (or has been exposed to
a  cumulative  15  total  seconds  of  energy)  and  the  member  has  not  gained  control  of  the
subject,  switch  to  other  force  options  unless  the  member  can  reasonably  justify  that
continued Taser use was necessary to ensure the safety of the member or another person.

Request Supervisor. As soon as practical, a member who has used or anticipates using a Taser will
request that a supervisor respond to the scene.

IV.

POST-DISCHARGE RESPONSIBILITIES

Deploying Member. Immediately upon gaining control and restraining the subject, deploying member
will:

C.

A.

avoid placing additional stress on the subject (for instance, avoid kneeling on the subject);

notify  their  immediate  supervisor,  the  watch  operations  lieutenant  assigned  to  the  district  of
occurrence,  the  Office  of  Emergency  Management  and  Communications  (OEMC),  and  the
Crime Prevention and Information Center (CPIC) of the Taser deployment;

request the appropriate medical aid, including contacting emergency medical services (EMS)
from the Chicago Fire Department, if:

the subject was exposed to electricity;

probes penetrated the subject’s skin; or

a.

b.

c.

the subject appears to be in any physical distress or complains of injury.

OLEORESIN CAPSICUM (OC) DEVICES AND OTHER CHEMICAL AGENT USE
INCIDENTS

ISSUE DATE:

RESCINDS:

INDEX CATEGORY:

Field Operations

TBD

EFFECTIVE DATE:

TBD

PURPOSE
This directive outlines the policy governing discharges of Personal Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) devices, special
weapons that dispense Capsaicin II Powder Agent (PepperBall), or larger volumes of chemical agents.

Sanctity of Human Life. All incidents will be resolved with the foremost regard for the preservation of
human life and the safety of all persons involved. A member's decision to utilize Personal OC devices
or other chemical agents will be made in accordance with G03-02, "Use of Force."

De-Escalation.  Members  will  use  de-escalation  techniques  to  prevent  or  reduce  the  need  for  force
when  it  is  safe  and  feasible  to  do  so  based  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstances.  This  includes
continually  assessing  the  situation  and  modifying  the  use  of  force  as  circumstances  change  and  in
ways that are consistent with officer safety.

When  Use  is  Authorized.  Department  members'  use  of  Personal  OC  devices  or  other  chemical
agents must be objectively reasonable, necessary under the circumstances, and proportional to the
threat,  actions,  and  level  of  resistance  offered  by  a  subject.  Consistent  with  G03-02-01,  "Force
Options,"  Department  members  are  authorized  to  use  Personal  OC  devices  or  other  chemical
agents for the following subjects:

OC  spray,  special  weapons  that  dispense  Capsaicin  II  powder  agents,  and  other  chemical
devices are authorized force options against an assailant, whose actions use or threaten the
use of force against a Department member or another person.

OC spray is an authorized force option against active resisters. If an active resister is part of
a group or crowd, OC is authorized only after obtaining approval from the Superintendent or
his or her designee.

OC  spray  is  an  authorized  force  option  against  passive  resisters  only  under  the  following
conditions:

Occupants  of  a  motor  vehicle  who  is  passively  resisting  arrest  and  only  after
obtaining authorization from an on-scene supervisor the rank of sergeant or above.

Noncompliant  groups,  crowds,  or  an  individual  taking  part  in  a  group  or  crowd  and
only after obtaining authorization from the Superintendent or his or her designee.

Special weapons that dispense the Capsaicin II powder agent or larger volumes of chemical
agents are authorized force options against active and passive resistors that are part of a
noncompliant groups, crowds, or an individual taking part in a group or crowd only under the
following conditions:

1.

2.

3.

1.

a.

b.

a.

b.

when the chemical agent is used only for area saturation, and

only after obtaining authorization from the Superintendent or his or her designee.

D.

Prohibitions. For the safety of everyone involved, the following additional restrictions apply:

Persons  Vulnerable  to  Injury.  Personal  OC  devices  or  other  chemical  agents  will  not  be
used on a subject who is potentially at a greater risk of serious injury from their use, unless
the  subject  is  defined  as  an  assailant  and  other  force  options  are  not  readily  available  or

would  otherwise  be  ineffective.  People  who  are  potentially  at  greater  risk  of  serious  injury
from Personal OC device or other chemical agent use include, but are not limited to, children,
pregnant women, and the elderly.

2.

Enclosed Areas. Personal OC devices or other chemical agents will not be used in enclosed
areas  unless  the  subject  is  defined  as  an  assailant  and  other  force  options  are  not  readily
available or would otherwise be ineffective.

Justify  Separate  Uses  of  Force.  An  initial  application  of  a  Personal  OC  device  or  other  chemical
agent and each subsequent application must be individually justified and documented on the Tactical
Response Report (TRR) as a separate use of force.

Department members will refer to the Department directive entitled "Personal Oleoresin Capsicum
(OC)  Devices"  for  specific  procedures  on  device  protocols  including  training,  maintenance,  and
accountability.

III.

CONDITIONS ON THE USE OF PERSONAL OC DEVICES OR OTHER CHEMICAL AGENTS

Authorized Manner of Use. A member who is discharging a Personal OC device or other chemical
agent will, when possible, give verbal commands and warnings prior to, during, and after discharge,
including informing other Department members on the scene of the discharge.

Request Supervisor. As soon as practical, a member who has used or anticipates using a Personal
OC device or other chemical agent will request that a supervisor respond to the scene.

Whenever  possible,  the  ranking  member  on  the  scene  of  an  incident  will  notify  the  Chicago  Fire
Department prior to the anticipated use of a device that dispenses a chemical agent through use of
special weapons deployed by the Special Weapons and Tactics team (SWAT).

IV.

POST-DISCHARGE RESPONSIBILITIES

A.

Effect Mitigation. To assist in mitigating the effects of the discharge, Department members will:

E.

F.

A.

B.

C.

1.

2.

3.

4.

if  possible,  relocate  the  individual(s)  to  an  area  of  uncontaminated  air  and  face  the
individual(s) into the wind.

provide an opportunity for the subject(s) to eliminate the effects of the agent by flushing the
affected areas with cool water. This should take place as soon as feasible, to the extent that
the subject can be controlled without possible injury to himself or others.

a.

b.

c.

d.

Subjects wearing contact lenses should remove them, if possible, before flushing the
eyes with water.

Under  normal  circumstances  all  symptoms  of  exposure  to  OC  should  disappear
within thirty to forty-five minutes.

Clothing that becomes contaminated with OC can be laundered in the usual manner
without fear of contaminating other laundry.

Special equipment or a special washing process is not required to decontaminate an
enclosed area. The opening of doors and windows will normally result in the removal
of OC from the environment within forty-five minutes.

advise  the  subject  to  refrain  from  rubbing  the  affected  area(s)  or  using  creams,  ointments,
commercial eye washes, or bandages.

if  it  is  practical,  avoid  transporting  an  individual  who  is  wet  with  OC.  Transporting  a  subject
when dry will minimize the possibility of the member or vehicle becoming contaminated.

Sanctity of Human Life. All incidents will be resolved with the foremost regard for the preservation of
human life and the safety of all persons involved. A member's decision to utilize a Department canine
as a force option will be made in accordance with G03-02, "Use of Force."

De-Escalation.  Department  members  will  use  de-escalation  techniques  to  prevent  or  reduce  the
need for force when it is safe and feasible to do so based on the totality of the circumstances. This
includes continually assessing the situation and modifying the use of force as circumstances change
and in ways that are consistent to officer safety.

Canine  Use  -  When  Authorized.  Department  members'  use  of  a  Department  canine  as  a  force
option  must  be  objectively  reasonable,  necessary  under  the  circumstances,  and  proportional  to  the
threat,  actions,  and  level  of  resistance  offered  by  a  subject.  Consistent  with  G03-02-01,  "Force
Options," Department members are authorized to use a Department canine as a force option for the
following subjects:

1.

Active Resisters.

The use of a canine to physically apprehend an active resister is limited to:

a.

b.

c.

a subject who is alleged to have committed either a felony or a violent misdemeanor.

a subject who is reasonably believed to be armed.

a  search  for  a  felony  subject  conducted  in  areas  or  buildings  that  contain  hidden
locations.

NOTE:

A  canine  may  be  used  in  this  situation  to  locate  a  subject  who  is
attempting  to  avoid  apprehension  and  who  fails  to  comply  with  a
sworn member's orders to reveal themselves.

2.

Assailants.

A canine is an authorized force option against a subject who fits the definition of an assailant.
In the case of an incident involving a canine, an assailant will also include a person who is an
imminent threat to the canine.

Prohibitions. Canines will not be used as a force option for the following:

crowd control situations, unless a sworn exempt-rank member authorizes the use of canine
teams  in  response  to  a  crowd  that  cannot  be  contained  by  other  police  methods  and  the
crowd is likely to cause personal injury or property damage.

NOTE:

Department members will refer to the Department directive entitled "Canine
Teams" for specific procedures on crowd-control deployments.

subjects who are at a greater risk of serious injury or death from canine, unless the actions of
the  subject  suggests  that  lesser  force  options  will  be  unsuccessful.  People  who  are
potentially  at  a  greater  risk  of  serious  injury  or  death  from  canine  use  include,  but  are  not
limited to, children, pregnant women, and the elderly.

NOTE:

If the Department member is responding to an incident involving persons in
need of mental health treatment, the member will act in accordance with the
Involving
Department  directive  entitled  “Responding 
Persons In Need Of Mental Health Treatment.”

Incidents 

to 

Department-owned  canines  are  trained  in  the  "find  and  bark"  method  of  finding  persons.  This
method of training requires the canine to bark or otherwise alert its handler upon discovering a person
and to remain in the immediate area of the person until relieved by the handler.

Department  members  will  refer  to  the  Department  directive  entitled  "Canine  Teams"  for  specific
procedures on:

requesting a Department canine team.

the required training and certification for Department canines and handlers.

when a Department canine inflicts an injury to a subject.

III.

CONDITIONS ON THE USE OF CANINES AS A FORCE OPTION

A.

Canine Deployment. Any deployed canine, when circumstances permit, will be:

kept in visual and auditory range of the canine handler at all times, except for brief periods
which make this requirement impracticable (e.g., the canine turns a corner, enters a room, is
walking through tall vegetation, or is among tall objects.)

called off immediately once the subject is under control.

Reporting.  A  Tactical  Response  Report  (TRR)  is  required  when  a  canine  physically  apprehends  a
subject  by  making  physical  contact,  including  grasping  the  subject  or  the  subject's  clothing.  The
assigned canine handler will:

be responsible for the completion of the TRR to document the canine physical apprehension.

document on the TRR the duration of the total time the canine was deployed.

Supervisory Response. Prior to the deployment of a canine, the canine handler will notify a canine
supervisor  and  a  field  supervisor  from  the  district  of  occurrence.  The  determination  of  the
appropriateness of the canine deployment will rest with the canine handler.

NOTE:

If a dispute regarding the deployment of a canine occurs between the canine handler
and the on-scene field supervisor, the final determination of the canine deployment
will rest with the canine handler's supervisor.

D.

Warnings.  Prior  to  the  use  of  the  canine,  the  handler  will  announce  his  or  her  police  authority  and
provide verbal warnings stating that the canine will be released if the subject does not comply with the

4.

handler's  orders.  When  it  is  safe  and  feasible  to  do  so,  the  canine  handler  will  provide  multiple
warnings.

Any verbal warning will be given in a loud and clear manner, capable of being heard by the
subject, any witnesses, or other parties within the targeted area.

The  member  issuing  the  warning  will  allow  a  reasonable  amount  of  time  for  Department
members and other uninvolved members of the public to respond and vacate the area.

For building searches, a verbal warning will be given again upon entering subsequent floors
or areas or if the size of the area is too great for a single warning.

For open field or block searches, a verbal warning will be given again upon the canine being
repositioned  into  an  area  which  was  not  in  audible  range  of  the  initial  or  other  subsequent
warnings.

Verbal  warnings  may  only  be  omitted  in  situations  where  exigent  circumstances  place  the
handler or others in imminent danger.

The fact that the warnings were given or omitted will be documented in the appropriate case
report.

E.

Apprehension by Canine

1.

In those circumstances when a canine finds a subject, the canine handler will:

a.

b.

only command the canine to physically apprehend or make contact with the subject
when the handler is in visual and auditory range of the canine and the subject.

not permit the canine to make contact with the subject unless commanded to do so
by the handler.

Department canines are trained and permitted to physically apprehend a subject only on the
command of the handler, to apprehend a subject that flees, or when the canine or the handler
is threatened with attack by the subject.

Once the handler determines that the incident is over and the control of the subject has been
obtained, the handler must immediately order the canine to release the subject. In making the
determination whether to order the canine to release the subject, the handler must carefully
consider what is reasonably necessary based on the totality of the circumstances to control
the subject and protect themselves and others from injury.

When  a  Department  canine  inflicts  injury  to  a  subject,  the  canine  handler  will  immediately
request  appropriate  medical  aid  for  the  injured  person,  including  contacting  emergency
medical  services  (EMS)  from  the  Chicago  Fire  Department  via  the  Office  of  Emergency
Management and Communications (OEMC).

NOTE:

For  further  guidance  on  medical  attention  for  injuries  caused  by  a
Department  canine,  Department  members  will  refer  to  the  Department
directives entitled "Use of Force" and "Canine Teams."
