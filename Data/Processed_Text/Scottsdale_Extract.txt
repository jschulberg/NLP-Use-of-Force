Use of Force 
 

Purpose/Definitions 

 
The purpose of this policy is to give members of the department guidelines on 
the reasonable use of force.  This directive is for department use only.  It is not 
intended to create higher legal standards of safety or care, especially with 
respect to third party claims.  Violations of this directive will not be used to 
substantiate any criminal or civil action, but may form the basis for department 
administrative review and/or sanctions. 
 
 
Objectively Reasonable :  Officer’s conduct falls within the parameters of 
what a reasonable, well-trained officer would do if faced with a similar set of 
circumstances. 
 
Reasonable Belief:  The particular facts and circumstances that lead a 
reasonable, well-trained officer to believe that the use of force is justified in a 
particular incident.  
 
Serious Physical Injury:  Any physical injury that causes serious and 
permanent disfigurement, serious impairment of health, or loss or protracted 
impairment of the function of any bodily organ or limb.

Policy 

 
A. 

 
B. 

It is the policy of the Scottsdale Police Department to use only the 
degree of force that is reasonable to conduct lawful public safety 
activities and achieve the lawful objectives of the department.  
Officers’ actions are reviewed on an “objectively reasonable” 
standard, in light of the facts and circumstances attending the incident. 
The reasonableness of force used will be judged from the perspective 
of a reasonable officer on the scene at the time of the incident, based 
upon the totality of the circumstances.  

There are various levels of force available to the officer.  Such levels 
of force include but are not limited to: verbal commands, empty hand 
tactics, intermediate weapons, and deadly force.  Each officer is 
expected to respond with the level of force that appears to be 
reasonable for the circumstances, and to accomplish the lawful 
objectives of the department.  

 
 
FIELD Orders chapter 1200/Use of Force only relates to the deployment of the 
weapons available. See General Orders chapter 2100/Appearance, Attire, and 
Equipment for weapons specifications.   
 
Employees are only authorized to carry lethal and less lethal weapons after 
being issued copies of and being trained on this chapter.  The issuance and 
training are documented.  In-service training for less lethal weapons occurs at 
least every two years.  
 
 
All use of force applications in a Detention facility will comply with FIELD 
Orders chapter 1200/Use of Force.

4. 

Immediate police action should only be taken in situations 
involving a serious criminal act or threat to public safety.  

When an incident does not require immediate police action, 
promptly report the incident to the police agency having 
jurisdiction. 

Officers are encouraged to carefully evaluate circumstances 
prior to taking action. With limited information and resources, 
the best course of action may be for you to delay action until 
it is safe to assist in an organized response. 

While off-duty, officers may enter onto the Indian community 
anytime entry is legitimate for such purposes as recreation, 
passage, and shopping.  Use discretion while carrying a 
firearm onto the Indian community. 

Promptly report off-duty enforcement action to an on-duty supervisor. 
The supervisor generates a significant incident report and/or makes 
staff notifications as necessary following the guidelines of General 
Orders chapter 3000/Organizational Reporting and Communication.

appropriate arrest tactics. 

Medical treatment – All suspects struck with Pepperball 
projectiles receive medical attention by the Fire Department 
(FD) paramedics or by other appropriate medical personnel 
(hospital, doctor, or other paramedics).  If a suspect 
contaminated with the powder from a Pepperball projectile is 
to be transported to the hospital, request FD wash the subject 
down to prevent contamination of the ER department. 
 
Call a Crime Scene Specialist (CSS) to photograph all 
subjects who are struck with Pepperball projectiles. 

Deploying Pepperball projectiles through the dedicated SA

When a situation warrants deploying specialty impact 
munitions, consult a SWAT Team Commander as soon as 
practical to determine if a SWAT Team call out is 
appropriate for the circumstances.  See FIELD Order 
3002/Deployment Authority/Guidelines. 
 
Deploying specialty impact weapons by decentralized 
SWAT Team members, while serving in their patrol 
capacity, occurs only with approval from a sworn supervisor 
or SWAT Team Leader. Depending on the circumstances, 
this approval may occur prior to contacting a SWAT Team 
Commander. 

Specialty impact munitions are deployed either through a 
dedicated 12-gauge shotgun, 37mm gas gun, or a 37mm SL-
6 multi-shot projectile launcher (sage gun).  All such 
dedicated weapons are conspicuously marked to distinguish 
them from other weapons. 
 
Each weapon (dedicated 12-guage shotgun) is stored in an 
unloaded condition (chamber empty, magazine empty) in 
the provided protective case. Officers will ensure proper 
impact munitions are loaded into the weapon prior to 
deployment. 

Do not deploy specialty impact munitions without back-up 
officers present, to include at least one officer designated as 
lethal cover.  Whenever possible, a tactical plan should be 
developed communicated to all involved officers prior to 
actual deployment. 
 
Deliver specialty impact munitions to target areas based on

USE of FORCE 
 

Taser 

1. 

 
2. 

X-26 Tasers are less lethal, intermediate weapons designed to 
incapacitate a subject from a safe distance without causing 
death or permanent injury while reducing potential injuries to 
subjects and officers.   The Taser is referred to as an 
Electronic Control Device (ECD). 

X-26 Tasers operate in two modes:  
 
a. 

Probe Delivery – Fires two probes up to a distance of 
25 feet.  After striking the subject, the officer is able 
to deliver an electrical current that interrupts the 
neuromuscular impulses traveling though the body.  
The optimum effective range is 7 to 15 feet.  

3. 

 
Justification for Using X-26 Tasers:  
 
a. 

Drive Stun – Operates as a “contact” stun device.  
The ECD may be deployed with or without a live 
cartridge, and can be fired with an expended 
cartridge. If the live cartridge is still inserted when 
delivering a drive stun, it follows the same principles 
as the Angled Drive Stun taught during certification 
classes. 

To detain, arrest, defend, and protect individuals 
when aggression or resistance exists or is threatened. 

When empty hand techniques have failed or officers 
can reasonably articulate they would have failed and 
deadly force is not authorized. 

In other instances where an immediate threat exists 
and using a Taser is considered reasonable. 

 
b. 

 
b. 

 
c. 

 
d. 

To protect subjects who are either attempting to harm 
themselves or commit suicide.  

 
A Taser may be deployed on an animal threatening to cause 
injury. 

Officers or other authorized personnel issued an X-26 Taser 
will wear it on their duty belt, support side at all times or in a  
thigh holster on the support side (approved by the Taser

The safety on.  

The laser set, at or returned to, the default setting.  
The X-26 Taser can have its laser and flashlight 
features changed by the user.  Although these 
features may be modified at the user’s discretion for 
a particular tactical situation, if the laser is disabled, 
return it to the default setting before holstering. The 
default setting is “laser only” (LO). 

A loaded Taser cartridge. 

 
c. 
 
d. 

Another cartridge readily accessible on your person, 
or from the extended DPM (Digital Power 
Magazine) of the X26.  

 
Note:  Command staff does not have to carry the extra 

cartridge on their person as long as a second cartridge 
is readily available. 

 
Sworn employees assigned to specialty units (ROP, SAU, 
HEAT etc.) will carry their Taser on the opposite side from 
their firearm. Any deviation to this carry method must be 
approved by the officer’s chain of command and the training 
unit commander. 

 
7.          Sworn employees in patrol/specialty units who are working an 

off-duty position in uniform capacity will wear the Taser on 
their duty belt or thigh holster during the assignment. 

6. 

 
8. 

If assigned an X-26 Taser, officers may remove either the 
baton or OC; however, the removed intermediate weapon 
must still be readily available and accessible if needed.  
 

Spark test the Taser for the full five seconds before starting your shift 
to ensure it is functioning properly.  Conduct the spark test at district 
bullet traps or outside in a safe area. 

1. 

To conduct the spark test:  

• Remove the cartridge and store it in an accessible area 
away from the immediate proximity of the firing bay.  

• Pull the trigger and let cycle for five seconds.  
• During the cycle, visually inspect the firing bay for an 

arch.   

• Return the Taser to “safe” after the five-second cycle. 

2. 

Visually inspect the firing bay for any impediments that

would prevent the cartridge from seating properly. 

Inspect the Taser cartridge itself for the following:  

• Blast doors still affixed. 
• Expiration date has not passed.  
• Nothing is protruding from the front or sides of the 

cartridge and/or the cartridge body is not significantly 
damaged. 

4. 

Load your cartridge and holster. 

Perform a spark test for the following reasons: 
 
1. 

Components inside the Taser device are more reliable when 
energized on a regular basis. 

To determine that device components are functioning 
properly, including an actual ‘spark’ across the firing bay. 

To confirm adequate DPM strength. 

Additional maintenance functions are outlined in General Order 
2115/X-26 Taser. 

Taking into consideration the justification for using an 
intermediate weapon, a Taser may be deployed in either 
mode when reasonable and based on the totality of the 
circumstances known to the officer.  

You may first use the laser sighting system with verbal 
warnings to elicit compliance. 

Ensure back-up officers are available to act with lethal force 
if necessary.  

• Deploy the Taser in a team concept that includes a plan to 
physically restrain the suspect, taking advantage of the 
window of opportunity the Taser provides to subdue and 
arrest.    

• Communicate this team deployment to all present to 

enhance officer safety.   

• Deployment should include a plan for transition to an 

alternate weapon system if the Taser does not result in the 
desired compliance level within a reasonable number of 
applications.   

• The tactical decision to Taser an individual for one, two, 

three, or more five-second cycles depends on the specific 
circumstances of the particular incident.   
 

4. 

Consider that repeated, prolonged, and/or continuous

applications of the Taser discharge do not significantly impair 
breathing or respiration.     

Give a warning, unless tactically unsound.   

Consider the potential injury to subjects who are running or 
traveling at high speeds (bikes, skateboards etc.).  Also 
consider age and physical disabilities. 

Against passive resistance. 

Do NOT use Tasers: 
 
a. 
 
b. 
 
c. 

As a prod. 

 
d. 
 
e. 

 
f.

i. 

 
j. 

As a method to awaken sleeping or intoxicated 
subjects. 

To obtain information. 

Inside a structure where illicit drug production is 
suspected. 

Against suspects who are near flammable liquids or 
gases. 

From or at occupants inside moving motor vehicles 
unless defending your life or the life of another. 

Against individuals who are in danger of falling from 
an elevated place (tree, roof, ladder, balcony, etc.). 

In the Detention areas solely as a method to obtain 
evidence.  However, should a suspect become 
combative while in a Detention area, the Taser may 
be used to regain control.  

Against obviously infirm persons, or those who are 
known or appear to have existing health conditions 
that would put them at unwarranted risk during a 
Taser exposure.

DEPLOYMENT 
 

 
 
DRIVE STUN – The live cartridge does not need to be removed to apply. 
Whether a live cartridge is inserted or not, it is considered an Angled Drive 
Stun application as taught during certification classes. 

Preferred target areas are muscles or nerve points of the legs, 
arms, stomach or back.

Unless circumstances dictate it, avoid the head, groin, neck, 
or genitalia. 

Preferred target areas are larger muscle groups such as the 
subject’s back or thighs.  

Unless circumstances dictate it, avoid the head, groin, neck, 
or genitalia. 

Paramedics – Request paramedics to respond to the scene in 
all Taser deployments, whether the subject has been struck 
via probe delivery or drive stun.    

Be aware of subjects who appear to manifest 
symptoms of excited delirium or other symptoms of 
distress.   

If at all possible do not restrain these subjects in such 
a manner, or by a device, that would tend to inhibit 
either respiration or breathing.  This includes using 
such methods as being pinned down by multiple 
officers or being outfitted with any unusually 
restrictive clothing items or spit-masks. 

Probes that are superficially lodged in the skin may be 
removed by a trained officer, Detention Officer (DO), or 
Municipal security as long as another officer is present.  The 
officer/DO/Municipal security will: 

Wear latex gloves. 

Place the spent probes in the spent cartridge, barb 
side down. 

Have paramedics evaluate the subject and clean and 
bandage the wounds, if needed. 

Impound the probes, wires, a sampling of Anti-Felon 
Identification (AFID) Tags and the cartridge as 
evidence.  Treat probes that have penetrated the body 
like contaminated needles and impound 
appropriately.  

Do not attempt to remove a probe if a subject is combative or 
if the probe is in the face, eyes, neck, groin, female breast or 
is deeply imbedded.

Field Deployments – After all field deployments, the 
responsible officer contacts the Taser Program Manager via 
email or voice message within 24 hours of deployment.  A  
Taser technician performs a download within seven days of 
the deployment.

above routine handcuffing procedure.  
 

1. 

Officer Injury  
a. 

When an officer is injured, a verbal report or 
interview may take the place of a written report, until 
the officer is able to complete the written report.   

 
b. 

Investigators assigned to the case may complete the 
use of force reporting requirements if the officer is 
injured. 

Supervisors – Review all DRs involving use of force and 
advise your chain of command of any use of force incidents 
that may result in a citizen complaint, involves mandatory 
review of use of force actions, or use of force actions not 
within policy.   

 
Use of Force Reporting in RMS for Statistical Data 

Except for an officer involved in the use of deadly force, 
complete whenever a suspect engages in defensive resistance 
during arrest, or when using force above routine handcuffing 
procedure.     

Forward use of force reporting in mandatory review of use of 
force action through the chain of command. 

Once approved by the chain of command,    Internal Affairs 
(IA) will assign for review, as needed. 

The use of force supplement pages included in RMS are in 
addition to the requirement of documenting the incident in the 
narrative section and are used as a statistical gathering device, 
not an investigative tool.
