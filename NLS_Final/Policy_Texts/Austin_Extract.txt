CHIEF'S MESSAGE 
May 24th, 2015 

I  am  proud  to  present  the  newest  edition  of  the  Austin  Police  Department  Policy  Manual.  The 
Policy Manual is designed to assist all employees in accomplishing the Department's mission in a 
professional and lawful manner. Adherence to these policies also helps safeguard employees and 
the  Department  against civil  litigation  and  ensures  that  employees  will  be protected  when their 
individual actions are scrutinized, especially after a critical incident. 

All employees will abide by these policies and are responsible for keeping themselves current on 
the content of this manual. 

As always, be safe and thank you for your commitment to excellence.

LAW ENFORCEMENT CODE OF ETHICS 
As  a  law  enforcement  officer,  my  fundamental  duty  is  to  serve  the  community;  to  safeguard 
lives  and  property;  to  protect  the  innocent  against  deception,  the  weak  against  oppression  or 
intimidation and the peaceful against violence or disorder; and to respect the constitutional rights 
of all to liberty, equality and justice. 

I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all and will behave in a manner that does 
not bring discredit to me or to my agency. I will maintain courageous calm in the face of danger, 
scorn or ridicule; develop self-restraint; and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others. Honest 
in thought and deed both in my personal and official life, I will be exemplary in obeying the law 
and the regulations of my department. Whatever I see or hear of a confidential nature or that is 
confided to me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret unless revelation is necessary in 
the performance of my duty. 

I  will  never  act  officiously  or  permit  personal  feelings,  prejudices,  political  beliefs,  aspirations, 
animosities  or  friendships  to  influence  my  decisions.  With  no  compromise  for  crime  and  with 
relentless  prosecution  of  criminals,  I  will  enforce  the  law  courteously  and  appropriately  without 
fear or favor, malice or ill will, never employing unnecessary force or violence and never accepting 
gratuities. 

I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith, and I accept it as a public trust to be 
held so long as I am true to the ethics of police service. I will never engage in acts of corruption 
or  bribery,  nor  will  I  condone  such  acts  by  other  police  officers.  I  will  cooperate  with  all  legally 
authorized agencies and their representatives in the pursuit of justice. 

I know that I alone am responsible for my own standard of professional performance and will take 
every reasonable opportunity to enhance and improve my level of knowledge and competence. 

I will constantly strive to achieve these objectives and ideals, dedicating myself before God to my 
chosen profession . . . law enforcement.

CANONS OF POLICE ETHICS 
Article 1: Primary Responsibility of Job 

The  primary  responsibility  of  the  police  service,  and  of  the  individual  officer,  is  the  protection 
of  people  of  the  United  States  through  the  upholding  of  laws.  Chief  among  these  laws  is  the 
Constitution  of  the  United  States  and  its  Amendments.  The  law  enforcement  officer  always 
represents the whole of the community and it's legally expressed will and is never the arm of any 
political party or clique. 

Article 2: Limitations of Authority 

The first duty of a law enforcement officer, as upholder of the law, is to know its bounds upon him 
in enforcing it. Because he represents the legal will of the community, be it local, state, or federal, 
he  must  be  aware  of  the  limitations  and  proscriptions  which  the  people,  through  the  law,  have 
placed  upon  him.  He must  recognize  the  genius  of  the  American  system  of  government  which 
gives to no man, groups of men, or institutions, absolute power; and he must ensure that he, as 
a prime defender of that system, does not pervert its character. 

Article 3: Duty to be Familiar with the Law and with Responsibilities of Self and Other Public 
Officials 

The law enforcement officer shall assiduously apply himself to the study of the principles of the 
laws  which  he  is  sworn  to  uphold.  He  will  make certain  of  his  responsibilities  in  the  particulars 
of their enforcement, seeking aid from his  superiors in matters of technicality or principle when 
these are not clear to him. He will make special effort to fully understand his relationship to other 
public officials, including other law enforcement agencies, particularly on matters of jurisdiction, 
both geographically and substantively. 

Article 4: Utilization of Proper Means to Gain Proper Ends 

The  law  enforcement  officer  shall  be  mindful  of  his  responsibility  to  pay  strict  attention  to  the 
selection of means in discharging the duties of his office. Violations of law or disregard for public 
safety and property on the part of an officer are intrinsically wrong; they are self-defeating in that 
they instill in the public mind a like disposition. The employment of illegal means, no matter how 
worthy the end, is certain to encourage disrespect for the law and its officers. If the law is to be 
honored, it must be by those who enforce it. 

Article 5: Cooperation with Public Officials in the Discharge of Their Authorized Duties 

The  law  enforcement  officer  shall  cooperate  fully  with  other  public  officials  in  the  discharge  of 
authorized  duties,  regardless  of  party  affiliation  or  personal  prejudice.  He  shall  be  meticulous, 
however, in assuring himself of the propriety, under the law, of such actions and shall guard against 
the use of his office or person, whether knowingly or unknowingly, in any improper or illegal action. 
In any situation open to question, he shall seek authority from his superior officer, giving him a 
full report of the proposed service or action. 

Article 6: Private Conduct

Canons of Police Ethics 

The  law  enforcement  officer  shall  be  mindful  of  his  special  identification  by  the  public  as  an 
upholder of the law. Laxity of conduct or manner in private life, expressing either disrespect for the 
law or seeking to gain special privilege, cannot but reflect upon the police officer and the police 
service. The community and the service require that the law enforcement officer lead the life of 
a decent and honorable person. Following the career of a police officer gives no person special 
perquisites. It does give the satisfaction and pride of following and furthering an unbroken tradition 
of safeguarding the American republic. The officer who reflects upon this tradition will not degrade 
it. Rather, he will so conduct his private life that the public will regard him as an example of stability, 
fidelity, and morality. 

Article 7: Conduct Toward the Public 

The law enforcement officer, mindful of his responsibility to the whole community, shall deal with 
individuals  of  the  community  in a manner  calculated  to instill  respect for  its  laws  and its  police 
service. The law enforcement officer shall conduct his official life in a manner such as will inspire 
confidence and trust. Thus, he will be neither overbearing nor subservient, as no individual citizen 
has an obligation to stand in awe of him nor a right to command him. The officer will give service 
where he can, and will require compliance with the law. He will do neither from personal preference 
or prejudice but rather as a duly appointed officer of the law discharging his sworn obligation. 

Article 8: Conduct in Arresting and Dealing with Law Violators 

The law enforcement officer shall use his powers of arrest strictly in accordance with the law and 
with due regard to the rights of the citizen concerned. His office gives him no right to prosecute the 
violator nor to mete out punishment for the offense. He shall, at all times, have a clear appreciation 
of his responsibilities and limitations regarding detention of the violator. He shall conduct himself in 
such a manner as will minimize the possibility of having to use force. To this end, he shall cultivate 
a dedication to the service of the people and the equitable upholding of their laws, whether in the 
handling of law violators or in dealing with the law abiding. 

Article 9: Gifts and Favors 

The  law  enforcement  officer,  representing  government,  bears  the  heavy  responsibility  of 
maintaining, in his own conduct, the honor and integrity of all government institutions. He shall, 
therefore,  guard  against  placing  himself  in  a  position  in  which  any  person  can  expect  special 
consideration or in which the public can reasonably assume that special consideration is being 
given. Thus, he should be firm in refusing gifts, favors or gratuities, large or small, which can, in the 
public mind, be interpreted as capable of influencing his judgment in the discharge of his duties. 

Article 10: Presentation of Evidence 

The law enforcement officer shall be concerned equally in the prosecution of the wrong-doer and 
the defense of the innocent. He shall ascertain what constitutes evidence and shall present such 
evidence impartially and without malice. In so doing, he will ignore social, political, and all other 
distinctions among the persons involved, strengthening the tradition of the reliability and integrity 
of an officer's word.

Article 11: Attitude Toward Profession 

The law enforcement officer shall regard the discharge of his duties as a public trust and recognize 
his responsibility as a public servant. By diligent study and sincere attention to self-improvement, 
he shall strive to make the best possible application of science to the solution of crime, and in the 
field  of  human  relationships,  shall strive for  effective leadership and  public  influence  in  matters 
affecting public safety. He shall appreciate the importance and responsibility of his office and shall 
hold police work to be an honorable profession rendering valuable service to his community and 
country.

PHILOSOPHY, VALUES, VISION AND MISSION 
Philosophy of the Austin Police Department 

The  protection  of  life  is  the  primary  core  value  and  guiding  principle  of  the  Austin  Police 
Department. As such, all employees will strive to preserve human life while recognizing that duty 
may  require  the  use  of  deadly  force,  as  a  last  resort,  after  other  reasonable  alternatives  have 
failed or been determined impractical. The department's basic goal is to protect life, property, and 
to  preserve  the  peace  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  freedom  secured  by  the  United  States 
Constitution. It is our duty to guarantee these inalienable rights in strict accordance with the highest 
principles of our society. Operating with the statutory and judicial limitations of police authority, 
our role is to enforce the law in a fair and impartial manner. It is not our role to legislate, render 
legal judgment, or punish. 

Employees should, by professional attitude and exemplary conduct, ensure all persons are treated 
with  respect  and  courtesy.  Employees  should  be  cognizant  of  the  fact  that  they  are  a  part  of 
the  community  they  serve  and  are  accountable  to  the  community  for  their  decisions  and  the 
consequences of those decisions. Employees should make every effort to involve the community 
in problem solving, crime suppression, and crime prevention. Employees should strive to know the 
residents they serve. Positive contact between employees and residents will enhance the public 
understanding of the employee's role in society and help build partnerships from which crime and 
fear of crime can be reduced. 

Knowledge of the law itself and the ability to understand those ideals upon which the law is built 
are the cornerstones of law enforcement. Compassion and discretion will play an important role 
within the philosophy of any employee. 

Employees of the Department are professionals. We must realize our main responsibility is the 
protection  of  the  community  and  the  preservation  of  human  life  and  dignity. We  are  guided  by 
the  philosophy  set  forth  here  and  the  policies  and  procedures  incorporated  into  this  and  other 
Department manuals. 

Department Values - I. C.A.R.E. 

Integrity - the cornerstone of Police work; without it, public trust is lost. 

Courage - to make the right professional decision. 

Accountable - to the community, the Department, and coworkers. 

Respect - of the community, the Department, and most importantly, self. 

Ethical - professional actions and decision making. 

Vision Statement: To be respected and trusted by all segments of Austin's diverse community. 

Mission Statement: To keep you, your family, and our community safe.

Austin Police Department 
Policy Manual

 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Department Manuals 

106.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Department manuals are the written procedures, guidelines and rules that formulate Department 
policies  to  provide  employees  with  clear  information  and  direction  as  to  the  expectations  and 
responsibilities relating to the performance of their duties. This policy defines the use of each type 
of manual, restricts the authority to issue, and provides distribution and maintenance guidelines 
to ensure that all personnel become acquainted with the contents of any manual affecting their 
position. 

106.1.1   LEGALITY OF CONTENTS 
If any section, subsection, item, clause, or phrase contained in any written directive is found to 
be  illegal  or  otherwise  incorrect  or  inapplicable,  such  finding  shall  not  affect  the  validity  of  the 
remaining portions of the written directive. 

106.2   GENERAL GUIDELINES 

(a)  Due to the amount of information needed to operate an organization the size and complexity 
of the Austin Police Department, Department Manuals are compiled into the following: 

Policy Manual. 

Special Orders. 

Standard Operating Procedure Manuals. 

4.  Operations Manuals. 

(b)  The Chief is the ultimate authority for the provisions of Department Manuals and will ensure 

compliance with all applicable Texas law. 

(c)  The Chief or designee may approve and authorize exceptions to individual provisions within 

any Department Manual or directive. 

Exemptions  may  be  made  after  a  legitimate  business  need  has  been  clearly 
articulated and it is determined that failure to provide the exemption would severely 
interfere  with  a  person's  or  work  group's  ability  to  achieve  department  goals  (e.g. 
Undercover officers having to comply with all provisions of the Dress and Grooming 
Code). 

Exemptions will not necessarily be referenced within the directives; however, it is the 
responsibility of the assistant chiefs and commanders to ensure that any exemptions 
are documented in a form where they can be identified and verified. All exemptions 
will require periodic review to determine their continued applicability and/or the need 
for alteration. 

3. 

Exemptions will not be authorized which allow employees to infringe upon residents' 
rights to be treated fairly, humanely, and equitably under the law.

106.3   POLICY MANUAL 
The Policy Manual is a statement of the current policies and general practices of the Department. 
Except where otherwise expressly stated, all employees are to conform to the provisions of this 
manual. It is recognized, however, that police work is not always predictable and circumstances 
may arise which warrant departure from these guidelines. It is the intent of this manual to be viewed 
from an objective standard, taking into consideration the sound discretion entrusted to members 
of the Department under the circumstances reasonably available at the time of any incident. 

(a)  All prior and existing manuals, orders and regulations which are in conflict with this manual 
are  revoked,  except  to  the  extent  that  portions  of  existing  manuals,  orders  and  other 
regulations which have not been included herein shall remain in effect where they  do not 
conflict with the provisions of this manual. 

(b)  A  computerized  version  of  this  Policy  Manual  will  be  made  available  on  the  Department 

network for access by all employees. 

(c)     The Policy Manual, as amended by subsequent Special Orders, shall stand over all other 

Department directives. 

106.4   SPECIAL ORDERS 
Special Orders establish an interdepartmental communication that may be used by the Chief of 
Police to make immediate changes to policy and procedure consistent with the current Meet and 
Confer agreement. 

(a)  Special Orders will immediately modify or change, and supersede, sections of this manual 
to which they pertain. Special Orders may also establish a temporary policy or procedure 
on a given subject for a specific length of time. 

(b)     Special  Orders  may  be  issued  to  the  organization  as  a  whole,  to  specific  part  of  the 

Department, or to an individual thereof. 

(c)  Special Orders will have the force and effect of a Policy until its expiration or the change is 
incorporated into a Policy. Special Orders will be incorporated into the manual as required 
upon final approval of the Chief of Police. 

(d)  Special  Orders  will  be  numbered  consecutively,  starting  with  the  four  digit  number  of  the 
year, followed by the number "01." For example, 2011-01 signifies the first Special Order 
for the year 2011. 

106.5   STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE MANUALS

rules established in the Policy Manual. However, exceptions to specific parts of the Policy 
Manual may be approved by an assistant chief/director. 

(b)  SOP  Manuals  are  generally  considered  public  documents;  information  of  a  sensitive  law

(c)  SOP Manuals that encompass an entire Command of the Department shall take precedence 

over SOP manuals that encompass a specific Unit within that Command. 

106.6   OPERATIONS MANUALS 
Oftentimes a need arises for extremely detailed procedural information of a confidential nature. 
This  information  will  be placed  in  an  Operations  Manual  (Ops  Manual)  and kept  separate from 
the SOP Manuals. Due to their inherent sensitive law enforcement nature, Ops Manuals are not 
considered public documents. 

(a)  Manuals  of  this  nature  have  the  same  force  and  effect  as  an  SOP  Manual.  Procedures 
contained  in  these  Manuals  shall  not  conflict  with  the  policies,  procedures,  or  rules 
established in the Policy Manual. However, exceptions to specific parts of the Policy Manual 
may be approved by an assistant chief/director. 

(b)     These Manuals may consist of materials produced professionally by a source outside of the 

Department, in addition to any intra-departmentally produced information. 

(c)  Materials may be included in these manuals due to: 

Their detailed and extensive nature. 

Their applicability to a very limited number of employees.

2. 

3. 

A  need  to  maintain  confidentiality  of  the  information  (e.g.,  investigative  strategy)

106.7   REVISION OF DEPARTMENT MANUALS 
Any  Department  employee  may  suggest  a  revision  to  a  Department  Manual.  Employee's 
suggesting  a  revision  of  the  contents  to  a  Department  Manual  shall  complete  a  Request  for 
Revision to Policy/Procedure/SOP form. 

(a)  Revision  requests  that  affect  multiple  Commands  (e.g.  Patrol,  District  Representatives, 
Sector Detectives) or the entire Department will be forwarded through the employee's chain- 
of-command  to  the  Risk  Management  Unit  or  directly  to  APDPolicy@austintexas.gov  on 
form PD0057. 

(b)  Revision requests that affect a single Command will be forwarded through the employee's 
chain-of-command to the appropriate commander/manager. If approved by the appropriate 
commander/manager, the revision request will be forwarded to the Risk Management Unit 
or directly to APDPolicy@austintexas.gov on form PD0057

Organizational Structure and Responsibility 

110.3.1   SUCCESSION OF COMMAND 
The  Chief  of  Police  exercises  command  over  all  personnel  in  the  Department.  During  planned 
absences, the Chief of Police will designate a person to serve as the acting Chief of Police. 

(a)  Except  when  designated  as  above,  the  order  of  command  authority  in  the  absence  or 

unavailability of the Chief of Police is as follows: 

1.  Chief of Staff. 

2. 

3. 

An assistant chief, in order of seniority. 

A commander, in order of seniority. 

110.3.2   UNITY OF COMMAND 
The principles of unity of command ensure efficient supervision and control within the Department. 
Generally,  each  employee  shall  be  accountable  to  one  supervisor  at  any  time  for  a  given 
assignment or responsibility. Except where specifically delegated authority may exist by policy or 
special assignment (e.g., K-9, SWAT), any supervisor may temporarily direct any subordinate if 
an operational necessity exists. 

110.3.3   SPAN OF CONTROL 
The number of employees under the immediate management of a single supervisor should not 
normally  exceed  fifteen  (15).  However,  when  staffing  requirements  are  anticipated  to  exceed 
fifteen per supervisor, the span of control should be based upon the complexity/variety of the tasks 
of subordinates and the potential for a supervisor to adequately oversee the number of employees 
involved. 

110.3.4   DELEGATED AUTHORITY 
At  all  levels  of  the  Department,  authority  will  be  delegated  to  employees  to  make  decisions 
necessary for the effective execution of their responsibilities. Employees are accountable for the 
use of, or the failure to use, delegated authority. 

110.3.5   DETERMINATION OF SENIORITY 

(a)  The senior officer at a police incident shall be determined by rank, then by seniority within 

(b)     Seniority of civilian employees shall be determined as follows: 

1.  Competent authority will designate a person to be in charge of a particular situation 

rank. 

or group. 

2. 

In  the  absence  of  designation  of  command,  seniority  will  be  determined  by  job 
classification, then by length of continuous service within the classification. 

110.4   EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES 
Employees are at all times individually responsible for conducting themselves in a professional 
and ethical manner and for treating coworkers with respect and dignity. The intent of this section

Organizational Structure and Responsibility 

is to clearly state that unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated in the workplace. Employees 
shall maintain loyalty to the Department as is consistent with the law and personal ethics. 

110.4.1   CHAIN-OF-COMMAND 
Employees  are  responsible for knowing  their chain-of-command  and  operating  within  it  except 
when impractical to do so. 

(a) 

If  an  employee  bypasses  the  chain-of-command,  the  employee  will  notify  his  affected 
supervisor as soon as practical. 

(b)  When  a  written  directive  requires  an  employee  notify  an  immediate  supervisor  and  the 

immediate supervisor is not readily available, the employee will: 

1.  Notify the person designated as the acting supervisor; or 

2.  Notify his next-level manager; or 

3.  Notify  another  supervisor  of  equal  rank/grade  with  similar  responsibilities  (e.g., 

another patrol sergeant, another forensics supervisor). 

110.4.2   AUTHORITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY 
Delegation of authority is essential to the good working order of any organization. 

(a)  Employees shall exercise the responsibility and authority of the position to which they are 
assigned in accordance with the job specifications and work rules of that agreement. 

(b)  Authority  to  complete  a  task  shall  be  commensurate  with  the  responsibility  placed  on 

employees by the supervisor. 

(c)  Supervisors are ultimately responsible for the action of themselves and their subordinates; 
supervisors  who  delegate  tasks  to  subordinate  employees  are  ultimately  accountable  for 
ensuring the task is completed. 

(d)     Employees shall be held accountable for their use, or failure to use, their delegated authority. 

110.4.3   OBEDIENCE TO ORDERS 
The Department is an organization with a clearly defined hierarchy of authority. This is necessary 
because  obedience  of  a  superior's  lawful  command  is  essential  for  the  safe  and  prompt 
performance of law enforcement operations. This section also applies to orders received by an 
employee in the field training program from a Field Training Officer (FTO). 

(a)  Orders  from  a  supervisor  to  a  subordinate  will  be  in  clear  and  understandable  language, 

civil in tone, and issued pursuant to departmental business. 

(b)  Employees will not publicly criticize nor comment derogatorily to anyone about instructions 

or orders they have received from a supervisor. 

(c)  Employees will promptly obey any lawful order from a supervisor of higher rank, regardless 

if the supervisor is outside of the employees' chain-of-command.

Subpoenas for documents or items from files maintained by Internal Affairs (IA) will be directed to 
the IA commander or lieutenant. No documents or items will be released pursuant to a subpoena 
without authorization from the APD legal advisor. 

(a)  Any open records request for IA files will be referred to the APD legal advisor. Open records 
requests can come directly from the general public or through the Civil Service Commission. 

(b)  Records will be released to the public only when authorized by law. All files that resulted in 

suspension of at least 1 day are subject to open records requests: 

1.  When IA is notified that an open records request has been received for a particular 
file, IA personnel will review the file to ensure information that is not related to the 
sustained allegation, which formed the basis of the disciplinary action, is redacted. 

2. 

3. 

The APD legal advisor will be consulted before any file is released in relation to an 
open records request to ensure that any necessary redactions have been completed. 

If  the  request  is  submitted  through  the  Civil  Service  Commission,  the  original 
redacted  case  file  will  be  transferred  to  the  Commission  as  soon  as  possible  to 
ensure  compliance  with the  statutory  deadline  for  responding  to  the  open  records 
request (10 business days or less). 

116.4   OTHER RECORDS 
Any other record not addressed in this policy shall not be subject to release where such record is 
exempted or prohibited from disclosure pursuant to state or federal law, including, but not limited 
to provisions of the Evidence Code relating to privilege. 

Any  record  which  was  created  exclusively  in  anticipation  of  potential  litigation  involving  this 
department shall not be subject to public disclosure (Tex. Gov't Code § 552.111 and 552.103). 

116.4.1   PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION

116.5   SUBPOENA DUCES TECUM 
Any subpoena duces tecum or discovery request should be promptly provided to a supervisor for 
review and processing. While a subpoena duces tecum may ultimately be subject to compliance, 
it  is  not  an  order  from  the  court  that  will  automatically  require  the  release  of  the  requested 
information. 

All questions regarding compliance with any subpoena duces tecum should be promptly referred 
to the Department's legal counsel so that a timely response can be prepared.

Meet and Confer 

127.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Chapter 143 of the Texas Local Government Code allows the City of Austin to adopt a collective 
bargaining process called "Meet and Confer." This process allows the City and the Department 
to negotiate  and  enter  into  a  written  agreement  with  the  labor  organization  representing  sworn 
employees concerning wages, work hours and other terms of employment. The written agreement 
is known as the "Meet and Confer Agreement."

Under  the  City  Charter  and  City-HR  policies,  the  City  Manager  has  overall  responsibility  for 
negotiating and administering contracts for the City, and shall manage the City's participation in the 
Meet and Confer process. The Chief is responsible for managing the Department's participation 
in the process. The City Manager and the Chief will conduct Meet and Confer negotiations jointly. 

(a)     City Bargaining Team 

The City Manager and the Chief will designate the members of the City bargaining 
team serving as the City's sole and exclusive bargaining agent. 

(b)  Swor

The  Austin  Police  Association  (APA)  is  a  labor  organization  that  is  currently 
designated by a majority of the sworn employees as their bargaining unit for the Meet 
and Confer negotiation. The City will only participate in negotiations with the APA. 

The APA may request information from the Department or City that is relevant to the 
negotiation or administration of the contract agreement. Any such requests shall be 
made by the APA's primary negotiator and submitted to the City bargaining team.

Austin Police Department 
Policy Manual

 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Response to Resistance 

200.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This policy recognizes that the use of force in response to resistance by law enforcement requires 
constant  evaluation  and that  response  to  resistance  is  a serious responsibility.  The  purpose of 
this policy is to provide officers with guidelines on objectively reasonable response to resistance. 
While there is no way to specify the exact amount or type of objectively reasonable force to be 
applied in any situation, each officer is expected to use these guidelines to make such decisions 
in a professional, impartial, and objectively reasonable manner. 

This  policy  is  written  in  terms  to  apply  to  sworn  officers.  In  incidents  where  civilian  employees 
are authorized to use force, they are subject to the same policies and procedures as officers but 
the test of objective reasonableness is judged from the perspective of an objectively reasonable 
civilian employee. 

200.1.1   PHILOSOPHY 
The use of force by law enforcement personnel is a matter of critical concern both to the public 
and to the law enforcement community. Officers are involved on a daily basis in numerous and 
varied human encounters and when warranted, may exercise control over another in carrying out 
their duties. 

The Department recognizes and respects the value of all human life and dignity without prejudice 
to anyone. It is also understood that vesting officers with the authority to use lawful and objectively 
reasonable  force  and  to  protect  the  public  welfare  requires  a  careful  balancing  of  all  human 
interests. 

200.1.2   DEFINITIONS 
Bodily Injury - Physical pain, illness or any impairment of physical condition (Tex. Penal Code 
§ 1.07(8)). 

Deadly  Force  - Force that is intended or known by the officer to cause, or in the manner of its 
use or intended use is known to be capable of causing death or serious bodily injury (Tex. Penal 
Code § 9.01(3)). 

Force - Any physical contact with a subject by an officer using the body or any object, device, or 
weapon, not including unresisted escorting or handcuffing a subject. 

Non-Deadly Force - Any application of force other than deadly force. 

Objectively  Reasonable  - An objective standard viewed from the perspective of a reasonable 
officer on the scene, without the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, and within the limitations of the totality 
of the circumstances presented at the time of the incident. 

Serious Bodily Injury - Bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death or that causes death, 
serious  permanent  disfigurement  or  protracted  loss  or  impairment  of  the  function  of  any  bodily 
member or organ (Tex. Penal Code § 1.07(46)).

200.1.3   DUTY TO INTERCEDE 
Any  officer  present  and  observing  another  officer  using  force  that  is  clearly  beyond  that  which 
is  objectively  reasonable  under the circumstances  shall,  when  in  a  position  to  do  so,  intercede 
to  prevent  the  use  of  such  excessive  force.  Such  officers  should  also  promptly  report  these 
observations to a supervisor.

(g)  Policy 212 (Force Review Board). 

200.2   RESPONSE TO RESISTANCE POLICY 
While the type and extent of force may vary, it is the policy of this department that officers use only 
that amount of objectively reasonable force which appears necessary under the circumstances to 
successfully accomplish the legitimate law enforcement purpose in accordance with this policy. 

(a)  Given that no policy can realistically predict every situation an officer might encounter, it is 
recognized that each officer must be entrusted with well-reasoned discretion in determining 
the appropriate response to resistance in each incident. 

(b)  Circumstances may arise in which officers reasonably believe that it would be impracticable 
or  ineffective  to  use  any  of  the  standard  tools,  weapons,  or  methods  provided  by  the 
Department. Officers may find it more effective or practicable to improvise their response 
to rapidly unfolding conditions they are confronting. In such circumstances, the use of any 
improvised device or method must still be objectively reasonable and used only to the extent 
which reasonably appears necessary to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose. 

(c)  While it is the ultimate objective of every law enforcement encounter to minimize injury to 
everyone involved, nothing in this policy requires an officer to actually sustain physical injury 
before applying objectively reasonable force. 

(d)  Any  complaint  by  a  subject  that  an  officer  caused  pain  or  injury  shall  be  treated  as  a 
response to resistance force incident, except complaints of minor discomfort from unresisted 
handcuffing. 

200.2.1   DETERMINING THE OBJECTIVE REASONABLENESS OF FORCE 
Any interpretation of objective reasonableness about the amount of force that reasonably appears 
to be necessary in a particular situation must allow for the fact that police officers are often forced to

make split-second decisions in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving, and 
the amount of time available to evaluate and respond to changing circumstances may influence 
their decisions. The question is whether the officer's actions are "objectively reasonable" in light 
of the facts and circumstances confronting him. 

(a)  When determining whether to apply any level of force and evaluating whether an officer has 
used objectively reasonable force, a number of factors should be taken into consideration. 
These factors include, but are not limited to: 

1. 

The conduct of the individual being confronted as reasonably perceived by the officer 
at the time. 

2.  Officer/subject factors such as age, size, relative strength, skill level, injury/level of 

exhaustion and number of officers vs. subjects. 

Influence of drugs/alcohol or mental capacity. 

Proximity of weapons. 

The  degree to  which  the  subject  has  been  effectively  restrained  and  his ability  to 
resist despite being restrained. 

Time  and  circumstances  permitting,  and  the  availability  of  other  options  (what 
resources are reasonably available to the officer under the circumstances). 

Seriousness of the suspected offense or reason for contact with the individual. 

Training and experience of the officer. 

Potential for injury to citizens, officers and subjects. 

10.  Risk of escape. 

11.  Whether the conduct of the individual being confronted no longer reasonably appears 

to pose an imminent threat to the officer or others. 

12.  Other exigent circumstances. 

200.2.2   USE OF FORCE TO AFFECT A DETENTION, AN ARREST OR TO CONDUCT A 
SEARCH 
An officer is justified in using reasonable force when the officer reasonably believes the use of 
such force is immediately necessary (Tex. Penal Code § 9.51(a)): 

(a)  To  make  or  assist  in  a  detention  or  an  arrest,  or  to  conduct  a  search  that  the  officer 

reasonably believes is lawful. 

(b)  To  prevent  or  assist  in  preventing  escape  after  an  arrest,  provided  the  officer  reasonably 

believes the arrest or search is lawful. 

(c)  To make an arrest or conduct a search under a warrant that the officer reasonably believes 

is valid.

reasonably impracticable to do so, officers should make clear their intent to arrest or search and 
identify themselves as a peace officer before using force (Tex. Penal Code § 9.51(a)(2)). 

200.3   DEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS 
An officer has no duty to retreat and is only justified in using deadly force against another when 
and  to  the  extent  the  officer  reasonably  believes  the  deadly  force  is  immediately  necessary  to 
(Tex. Penal Code § 9.51(c) and (e)): 

(a)  Protect himself or others from what he reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of 

death or serious bodily injury. 

(b)  Make an arrest or to prevent escape after arrest when the officer has probable cause to 

believe that: 

1. 

2. 

The subject has committed or intends to commit an offense involving the infliction or 
threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death; or 

The  officer  reasonably  believes  that  there  is  an  imminent  or  potential  risk  of 
serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately 
apprehended. 

200.4   REPORTING THE RESPONSE TO RESISTANCE 
Any  response  to  resistance  by  a  member  of  this  department  shall  be  documented  promptly, 
completely  and  accurately  in  an  appropriate  report  as  prescribed  by  Policy  211  (Response  to 
Resistance Inquiry, Reporting, and Review). 

200.4.1   NOTIFICATION TO SUPERVISORS 
Supervisor  notification  shall  be  made  as  soon  as  practicable  following  any  force  incident  or 
allegation of use of force. 

200.4.2   MEDICAL ATTENTION 
Prior to booking or release, medical assistance shall be obtained for any subject who has sustained 
visible  injury,  expressed  a  complaint  of  injury  or  continuing  pain  or  who  has  been  rendered 
unconscious. Based upon the officer's initial assessment of the nature and extent of the subject's 
injuries, medical assistance may consist of examination by fire personnel, paramedics, hospital 
staff or medical staff at the jail. 

A  subject  who  exhibits  extreme  agitation,  violent  irrational  behavior  accompanied  by  profuse 
sweating,  extraordinary  strength  beyond  their  physical  characteristics  and  impervious  to  pain 
(sometimes  called  "excited  delirium"),  or  who  requires  a  protracted  physical  encounter  with 
multiple  officers  to  be  brought  under  control,  may  be  at  an  increased  risk  of  sudden  death 
and  should  be  examined by qualified medical  personnel  as  soon  as  practicable.  Any  individual 
exhibiting signs of distress after such an encounter shall be medically cleared prior to booking.

Policy Manual

 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Firearm Discharge Situations 

202.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The  purpose  of  this  policy  is  to  establish  procedures  for  the  use  and  reporting  of  incidents 
involving the discharge of firearms. This policy is for internal use only and does not increase the 
Department's and/or an officer's civil or criminal liability in any way. Violations of this policy can 
only form the basis for departmental administrative actions. 

202.1.1   POLICY 
It is the policy of this department to resort to the use of a firearm when it reasonably appears to 
be necessary under the circumstances. 

(a)  An officer has no duty to retreat and is only justified in using deadly force against another 
when  and  to  the  extent  the  officer  reasonably  believes  the  deadly  force  is  immediately 
necessary to (Tex. Penal Code § 9.51(c) and (e)): 

1. 

Protect himself or others from what he reasonably believes  would be an imminent 
threat of death or serious bodily injury. 

2.  Make an arrest or to prevent escape after arrest when the officer has probable cause 

to believe that: 

(a)  The  subject  has  committed  or  intends  to  commit  an  offense  involving  the 

infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death; or 

(b)  The  officer  reasonably  believes  that  there  is  an  imminent  or  potential  risk 
of  serious  bodily  injury  or  death  to  any  other  person  if  the  subject  is  not 
immediately apprehended. 

(b)     To stop a dangerous and aggressive animal: 

(a) 

(b) 

In  circumstances  where  officers  encounter  any  animal  which  reasonably  appears, 
under the  circumstances, to pose  an  imminent threat  of  bodily  injury  to officers  or 
others, officers are authorized to use objectively reasonable force up to and including 
deadly force (when lesser means would be impractical) to neutralize the threat. 

In circumstances in which officers have sufficient advanced notice that a potentially 
dangerous domestic animal (e.g., dog) may be encountered, such as in the serving of 
a search warrant, officers should develop reasonable contingency plans for dealing 
with the animal without the use of deadly force (e.g., fire extinguisher, TASER Device, 
oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray, assistance of animal control). Nothing in this policy 
shall prohibit any officer from resorting to deadly force to control a dangerous animal 
if circumstances reasonably dictate that a contingency plan has failed or becomes 
impracticable. 

(c) 

In the event force is used against an animal by an officer and the animal is injured 
or there is a reasonable belief the animal was injured, regardless of whether visible

injury exists, officers shall make a reasonable attempt to ensure the animal receives 
care for its' injuries. This may include but is not limited to: 

(a)  Contacting  the  owner  to  arrange  private  treatment  in  an  appropriate  time 

frame. 

(b)  Contacting Animal Control to have the animal collected and treated 

(c)  Arranging transport of the animal to a veterinary facility 

(d)  Transporting the animal to a veterinary facility 

(c)  With  the  approval  of  a  supervisor,  an  officer  may  euthanize  an  animal  that  is  so  badly 
injured that human compassion requires its removal from further suffering and where other 
dispositions are impracticable. 

(d)  For target practice or recreational shooting at an approved range or any area where firing 

a weapon would be safe and not a violation of law. 

Where feasible, a warning should be given before an officer resorts to deadly force as outlined 
(a), (b) or (c) above. A specific warning that deadly force will be used is not required by this policy; 
only that a warning be given if feasible. 

202.1.2   WARNING SHOTS 
Warning shots are prohibited. 

202.1.3   MOVING VEHICLES 
Disabling  a  vehicle  by  use  of  a firearm  will  only  be  attempted  by  units  specially  trained  in  and 
equipped for this tactic and only under extraordinary circumstances. Officers who utilize a firearm 
against a vehicle or operator of a vehicle must meet the same standards established in 202.1.1 
(a) above. 

(a)  Officers shall exercise good judgment and will not place themselves in the path of a moving 
vehicle since doing so may increase the likelihood of having to resort to the use of deadly 
force. 

(b)  Unless it reasonably appears that it would endanger officers or the public, officers will move 

out of the path of any approaching vehicle. 

(c)  When encountering a vehicle being operated in a threatening manner, officers may leave 

a position of cover only: 

1. 

to utilize an avenue of escape 

2.  move to a position of better cover, or 

3. 

if the need to apprehend the suspect outweighs the danger that the apprehension 
would impose to the officer or any other person.

against the officer or others. 

202.1.4   DISPLAY OF FIREARMS 
Firearms  may  be  readied  for  use  in  situations  where  it  is  anticipated  they  may  be  required. 
Firearms  shall  not  be  displayed  or  pointed  in  a  threatening  or  intimidating  fashion  unless  it  is 
objectively reasonable to believe there is a substantial risk that the situation may escalate to the 
point where deadly force would be permitted. Firearms shall be secured or re-holstered as soon 
as reasonably practicable when it is determined that deadly force is no longer necessary. 

202.2   REPORT OF INTENTIONAL FIREARM DISCHARGE AGAINST A PERSON

Leg Restraint Device 

204.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The  proper  use  and  application  of  a  leg  restraint  devicecan  reduce  the  potential  of  injury  and 
damage to property when dealing with violent or potentially violent subjects. This policy provides 
guidelines for the proper use of these devices. 

204.1.1   PHILOSOPHY 
The Department recognizes and respects the value of all human life and dignity without prejudice 
to  anyone.  A  leg  restraint  device  should  only  be  used  when  officers  reasonably  believe  it  is 
necessary to augment other restraints while performing their lawful duties; a leg restraint device 
is never to be used as punishment. 

204.2   POLICY 
When  an  officer  encounters  circumstances  where  it  reasonably  appears  necessary  to  restrain 
the legs to prevent escape or restrain a violent or potentially violent subject during the course of 
a detention, arrest, and/or transportation, only Department approved RIPP Hobble or Ankle/Leg 
Iron restraint devices shall be used and only in the Department approved manner for temporary 
immobilization of the legs. 

Patrol sergeants and corporals will be assigned leg irons as part of their issued equipment on their 
personal inventory list. When the sergeant or corporal is no longer assigned to a patrol shift they 
will return the leg iron to Police Equipment. 

204.3   AUTHORIZED USE 

it on any subject. 

(a)  Only those officers trained in the use of the leg restraint device are authorized to employ 

(b)     The leg restraint device shall only be used after a subject has been handcuffed. 

(c)     In determining whether to use a leg restraint device, officers should consider the following: 

1. 

2. 

If the officer and/or others are subject to harm due to the assaultive behavior of a 
violent, resisting, and/or attacking subject. 

If it is objectively reasonable to protect the subject from his own actions (e.g., hitting 
his head against the interior of the Patrol unit, running away from the arresting officer 
while handcuffed, kicking at objects or officers). 

204.4   PROCEDURE 
The  leg  restraint  device  is  designed  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  injury  to  the  restrained  subject 
or others, and to reduce the likelihood of property damage caused by the restrained subject by 
preventing him from using his legs in a manner likely to result in injury or damage. The following 
guidelines shall be used when applying a leg restraint device:

If  practicable,  officers  should  notify  a  supervisor  of  the  intent  to  apply  the  restraint.  In  all 
cases,  a  supervisor  shall  be  notified  as  soon  as  practicable  after  the  application  of  the 
restraint and the name of that supervisor shall be noted in a report or supplement. 

(b)  This device shall not be used to hog tie. Once the subject's legs have been bound, the safety 

clip of a restraint shall not be attached to the chain of the handcuffs. 

(c)  Absent a medical emergency, the subject being restrained shall remain restrained until the 

officer arrives at the jail or other facility or the subject no longer poses a threat. 

(d)  Once secured, the subject should be placed in a seated or upright position. Subjects shall 
not be placed on their stomach for an extended period as this may potentially reduce their 
ability to breathe. 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The  restrained  subject  should  be  constantly  watched  by  an  officer  while  in  the 
restraint. The officer is to ensure the subject does not roll onto and remain on his 
stomach. 

The officer should look for signs of labored breathing and, where practicable, take 
appropriate  steps  to  relieve  and  minimize  any  obvious  factors  contributing  to  this 
condition. 

In  the  event  that  it  appears  reasonably  necessary  to  restrain  a  subject  in  such  a 
position that the subject's ability to sit upright is restricted, an officer should monitor 
the subject in an effort to minimize restricted breathing. The subject should be placed 
in an upright position as soon as it reasonably appears safe and practicable.

Control Devices and Techniques 

206.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
In an effort to reduce and minimize altercation related injuries to officers, the public and subjects, 
the  Department  authorizes  the  use  of  selected  control  devices.  These  control  devices  are 
approved in order to control violent or potentially violent subjects. It is anticipated that the use of 
these devices will generally result in fewer altercation related injuries to officers and subjects. The 
policy below is for the use and maintenance of control devices. 

206.1.1   PHILOSOPHY 
The use of control devices upon a subject by an officer shall only occur when the officer, while in 
the performance of his lawful duties, reasonably believes it necessary to gain control of the subject. 

The Department recognizes and respects the value of all human life and dignity without prejudice 
to anyone. It is also understood that vesting officers with the authority to use lawful and objectively 
reasonable force and protect the public welfare requires a careful balancing of all human interests. 

206.2   CONTROL DEVICES AND TECHNIQUES OVERVIEW 

206.2.1   WHEN DEVICES MAY BE USED 
When a decision has been made to control, restrain or arrest a violent, threatening or escaping 
subject, an approved control device may only be used when its use appears objectively reasonable 
under the circumstances. 

206.2.2   REPORTING USE OF CONTROL DEVICES AND TECHNIQUES 
Any application of a control device and/or technique shall be documented as prescribed by Policy 
211 (Response to Resistance Inquiry, Reporting and Review). 

206.2.3   APPROVED CONTROL DEVICES 
Only  Department  issued  or  approved  control  devices  and  munitions  shall  be  carried.  Only 
Department approved modifications may be made to any control device. 

(a)  The control devices approved by the Department are: 

1. 

Baton and/or Impact Weapons (long, short, side-handle or expandable). 

2.  Chemical Agents (Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) spray). 

3. 

4. 

Kinetic Energy Projectiles and their delivery systems. 

TASER Device - See Policy 208 (TASER® Guidelines). 

(b)  Every  control    device    shall  be  periodically  inspected  by  the  employee's  supervisor  or 
the  designated  instructor  for  a  particular  control  device.  All  daily  inspections,  routine 
maintenance,  charging  and  cleaning  shall  remain  the  responsibility  of  the  employee 
assigned the device.

Control Devices and Techniques 

(c)     All  damaged,  inoperative,  or  expended  control  devices  shall  be  returned  to  the  Property 

Control Office for disposal, repair and/or replacement. 

206.2.4   TRAINING FOR CONTROL DEVICES 

(a)  Only employees trained and certified in the use of a specified control device are authorized 
to carry and/or use that device. Proficiency training must be monitored and documented by 
a certified device, weapons, or tactics instructor. 

(b)  Civilian  employees  may  use  issued  chemical  agents  for  self-defense  only.  Recertification 

for chemical agents issued to civilian employees shall occur annually. 

(c)  Officers shall re-certify annually for all control devices they have been previously approved 
to carry with the exception of the TASER®. Recertification for the TASER® shall follow the 
guidelines set forth in Policy 208 (TASER® Guidelines). 

(d)  All formal training and proficiency for control devices shall be documented in the employees' 

training file. 

(e)  Employees  failing  to  demonstrate  proficiency  with  a  device  shall  be  provided  remedial 
training. Employees failing to pass remedial training shall not be permitted to carry the device 
and may be subject to other provisions prescribed by the Training Division. 

206.3   BATON AND IMPACT WEAPON GUIDELINES 
The baton and/or an impact weapon is authorized for use when, based upon the circumstances 
perceived by the officer, such force reasonably appears justified and necessary to result in the 
safe control of a subject. 

The  need  to  immediately  incapacitate  the  subject  must  be  weighed  against  the  risk  of  causing 
serious injury. The head, neck, spine and groin should not be intentionally targeted except when 
the  officer  has  an  objectively  reasonable  belief  the  subject  may  cause  serious  bodily  injury  or 
death to the officer or others. 

206.4   CHEMICAL AGENT GUIDELINES 
Chemical agents are devices used to minimize the potential for injury to employees, offenders, 
or other subjects. They should be used only in situations where such force reasonably appears 
necessary. 

(a)  Authorized employees may use chemical agents when the application of the chemical agent 

is objectively reasonable to subdue or control: 

A violent or physically resisting subject. 

1. 

2. 

A  subject  who  by  words  or  action  has  demonstrated  an  intention  to  be  violent  or 
to  physically  resist  and  who  reasonably  appears  to  present  the  potential  to  harm 
employees, himself, or others.

3. 

4. 

Apprehend a subject fleeing lawful arrest or detention. 

There is a reasonable expectation that it will be unsafe for employees to approach 
within contact range of the subject. 

206.4.1   PROHIBITED USES 
The following are prohibited uses of chemical agents: 

(a)     To torture, psychologically torment, elicit statements or inflict undue pain on any individual. 

(b)     Horseplay or practical jokes. 

(c)     Demonstrations without the permission of a supervisor. 

(d)     When a subject exhibits only verbal and/or passive resistance to arrest or authority. 

(e)  When a subject is under physical restraint unless the subject is still aggressively resisting 

and lesser means of controlling the subject have failed. 

206.4.2   CARRYING OF OLEORESIN CAPSICUM SPRAY 
Uniformed employees carrying the OC spray shall carry the device in its holster on the equipment 
belt. Plainclothes and non-field employees may carry the OC spray as authorized, consistent with 
the needs of their assignment or at the direction of their supervisor. 

206.4.3   TREATMENT FOR CHEMICAL AGENT EXPOSURE 
Subjects  who  have  been  affected  by  the  use  of  chemical  agents  should  be  afforded  means  of 
cleansing  the  affected  areas  as  soon  as  practicable.  Those  subjects  who  complain  of  further 
severe effects shall be afforded a medical examination by competent medical personnel. 

206.4.4   TRANSPORTING OF PRISONERS SUBJECTED TO CHEMICAL AGENT 
EXPOSURE 
When transporting prisoners who have been subjected to chemical agents, officers shall ensure 
that the prisoner stays upright with a clear airway and is not placed in a prone position to avoid 
possible positional asphyxia. Officers must be especially careful when tightly restraining combative 
subjects following the use of chemical agents. 

Before  booking,  officers  shall  advise  jail  personnel  when  a  prisoner  has  been  subjected  to 
chemical agents. 

206.5   KINETIC ENERGY PROJECTILES 
This  department  is  committed  to  reducing  the  potential  for  violent  confrontations  when  such 
subjects are encountered. Kinetic energy projectiles are less likely to result in death or serious 
physical injury.

Control Devices and Techniques 

Kinetic energy projectiles are approved by the Department and are fired from 12 gauge shotguns 
that are clearly identified as less lethal shotguns. Certain munitions can be used in an attempt to 
de-escalate a potentially deadly situation, with a reduced potential for death or serious physical 
injury. 

206.5.1   DEPLOYMENT 
Approved munitions are justified and may be used in an effort to compel individuals to cease their 
actions when such munitions present a reasonable option for resolving the situation at hand. 

(a)  Officers are not required or compelled to use approved munitions in lieu of other reasonable 
tactics  if  the  involved  officers  determine  that  deployment  of  these  munitions  cannot  be 
deployed safely. 

(b)  The  safety  of  hostages,  innocent  subjects  and  officers  takes  priority  over  the  safety  of 

subjects engaged in perceived criminal or suicidal behavior. 

206.5.2   EXAMPLES OF CIRCUMSTANCES APPROPRIATE FOR DEPLOYMENT 
Examples include, but are not limited to, the following types of situations where the subject: 

(a) 

Is  armed  with  a  weapon  and  the  tactical  circumstances  allow  for  the  safe  application  of 
approved munitions. 

(b)     Has made credible threats to harm himself or others. 

(c) 

Is engaged in riotous behavior or is throwing rocks, bottles or other dangerous projectiles 
at people and/or officers, creating a risk for injury. 

(d)  There is reasonable suspicion to believe that the subject has already committed a crime of 

violence and is refusing to comply with lawful orders. 

206.5.3   ADDITIONAL DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS 
Before discharging projectiles, the officer should consider the following factors: 

(a)  The subject's capability to pose an imminent threat to the safety of officers or others. 

(b)  Whether the subject is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight. 

(c)  The credibility of the subject's threat as evaluated by the officers present, and the subject's 

physical capacity/capability to carry out the threat. 

(d)  The availability of other force options and their possible effectiveness. 

(e)  Distance and angle to target. 

(f)      Type of munitions employed. 

(g)     Type and thickness of subject's clothing. 

(h)  The  subject's  actions  dictate  the  need  for  an  immediate  response  and  the  use  of  control 

devices appears appropriate.

206.5.4   SHOT PLACEMENT AND DEPLOYMENT DISTANCES 
Officers  should  generally  follow  their  training  instructions  regarding  minimum  deployment 
distances and target areas. The need to immediately incapacitate the subject must be weighed 
against the risk of causing serious injury or death. 

The head and neck should not be intentionally targeted, however any target area or distance may 
be considered when it reasonably appears necessary to accomplish immediate incapacitation in 
order to prevent serious injury or death to officers or others. 

206.6   PAIN COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES 
Pain  compliance  techniques  may  be  effective  in  controlling  a  passive  or  actively  resisting 
individual.  Officers  may  only  apply  those  pain  compliance  techniques  for  which  the  officer  has 
an objectively reasonable belief that the use of such a technique appears necessary to further a 
legitimate law enforcement purpose. 

(a)     Officers should consider the following when using pain compliance techniques: 

The potential for injury to the officers or others if the technique is not used. 

The potential for serious injury to the individual being controlled. 

3.  Whether the pain compliance technique is effective in achieving an appropriate level 

of control. 

The nature of the offense involved. 

The level of resistance of the individual(s) involved. 

The need for prompt resolution of the situation. 

If time permits (e.g., passive demonstrators), other reasonable alternatives. 

(b)  The  application  of  any  pain  compliance  technique  shall  be  discontinued  once  the  officer 
determines that compliance has been achieved or other more appropriate alternatives can 
reasonably be utilized. 

206.6.1   USE OF FORCE TO SEIZE EVIDENCE 

(a)  Pressure point techniques are the maximum amount of force authorized to seize evidence 
(e.g.,  narcotics)  when  there  is  probable cause to  believe it  is  being  held or  hidden  in the 
mouth of a subject. 

(b)  Soft/empty hand control is the maximum amount of force authorized to seize blood from a 

subject pursuant to a mandatory blood draw.

TASER Device Guidelines 

208.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The TASER® is intended to control a violent or potentially violent individual while minimizing the 
risk of serious injury. It is anticipated that the appropriate use of such a device will result in fewer 
serious injuries to officers and suspects. 

208.1.1   PHILOSOPHY 
The use of a TASER Device upon a subject by an officer shall only occur when the officer, while 
in the performance of his lawful duties, has an objectively reasonable belief that it is necessary 
to gain control of the subject. 

The Department recognizes and respects the value of all human life and dignity without prejudice 
to anyone. It is also understood that vesting officers with the authority to use lawful and objectively 
reasonable force to protect the public welfare requires a careful balancing of all human interests. 

208.2   POLICY 
Personnel who have completed department approved training may be issued a TASER Device for 
use during their current assignment. Personnel leaving a particular assignment may be required 
to return their issued device to the Department's inventory. 

Officers shall only use the TASER Device and cartridges that have been issued by the Department. 
If  an  officer  is  issued  a TASER®, the  device  must  be carried  as  a  part  of  a  uniformed officer's 
equipment in an approved holster. 

(a)  When the TASER Device is carried as a part of a uniformed officer's equipment, the TASER 

Device shall be carried on the side opposite from the duty weapon. 

(b)  All TASER Devices shall be clearly and distinctly marked to differentiate them from the duty 

weapon and any other device. 

(c)  Whenever practicable, officers should carry a total of two or more TASER Device cartridges 

on their person while carrying a TASER Device. 

208.3   VERBAL WARNINGS 
A verbal announcement of the intended use of the TASER Device should precede its application 
unless it would otherwise endanger the safety of officers or when it is not practicable due to the 
circumstances. 

(a)     The purpose of the warning is for the following: 

1. 

2. 

Provide the individual with a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply. 

Provide  other  officers  and  individuals  with  warning  that  a  TASER  Device  may  be 
deployed. 

(b)     The aiming laser should never be intentionally directed into the eyes of another.

(c)  The fact that a verbal and/or other warning was given, or the reasons it was not given, shall 

be documented in any related reports, as well as any responses by the subject. 

(d)  When  given,  the  verbal  warning  should  be  "TASER,  TASER,  TASER"  to  prevent  any 

confusion as to which weapon system is being deployed. 

208.4   USE OF THE TASER DEVICE 
As  with  any  law  enforcement  equipment,  the  TASER  Device  has  limitations  and  restrictions 
requiring consideration before its use. The TASER Device should only be used when its operator 
can safely approach the subject within the operational range of the TASER Device. Although the 
TASER Device is generally effective in controlling most individuals, officers should be alert to the 
potential for failure and be prepared with other options. 

Generally, an assisting officer should be present with lethal cover in the event the TASER Device 
is ineffective or defective and the subject initiates a potentially life threatening confrontation. 

Officers should never hold both a firearm and the TASER device at the same time. 

208.4.1   APPLICATION OF THE TASER DEVICE 
Authorized  personnel may  use  the TASER  Device when circumstances known to the  officer  at 
the time indicate that such application is objectively reasonable to control a subject in any of the 
following circumstances: 

(a)  Apprehend a subject fleeing lawful arrest or detention. 

(b)  A violent or physically resisting subject. 

(c)  There is reasonable expectation that it will be unsafe for officers to approach within contact 

range of the subject. 

(d)  A subject who by words or action has demonstrated an intention to be violent or to physically 
resist  and  who  reasonably  appears  to  present  the  potential  to  harm  officers,  himself,  or 
others. 

1.  Officers  should  give  a  verbal  warning  of  the  intended  use  of  the  TASER  Device 
followed  by  a  reasonable  opportunity  for  the  subject  to  voluntarily  comply,  when 
practicable. 

2.  Officers must be able to articulate their use of the TASER Device in an incident report. 

(a)  The TASER Device shall not be used to torture, psychologically torment, elicit statements 

208.4.2   PROHIBITED USES 
The following are prohibited uses of the TASER Device: 

or to punish any individual. 

(b)     Horseplay or practical jokes. 

(c)     Demonstrations, without the permission of a supervisor.

(d)     Against passively resisting subjects. 

(e)     Individuals who are covered in, or in close proximity to, any combustible material. 

208.4.3   SPECIAL DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS 

(a)  The use of the TASER Device should generally be avoided in the following situations unless 
the  totality  of  the  circumstances  indicate  that  other  available  options  reasonably  appear 
ineffective, impractical, or would present a greater danger to the officer, the subject or others, 
and the officer reasonably believes that the need to control the individual outweighs the risk 
of using the TASER Device. 

1.  Obviously pregnant females. 

Elderly individuals or obvious juveniles. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Individuals who are handcuffed or otherwise restrained. 

Individuals whose position or activity may result in collateral injury (e.g., falls from 
height, operating vehicles). 

(b) 

Individuals suspected of being under the influence of drugs/alcohol or exhibiting symptoms 
of  excited  delirium  (e.g.,  nudity,  profuse  sweating,  irrational  behavior)  may  be  more 
susceptible to collateral problems and should be closely monitored following the application 
of the TASER Device until they can be examined by paramedics or other medical personnel. 

(c)  Because  the  application  of  the  TASER  Device  in  the  drive-stun  mode  (i.e.  direct  contact 
without darts) relies primarily on pain compliance and requires close proximity to the subject, 
additional  caution  should  be  exercised.  The  application  in  drive-stun  mode  should  be 
limited to brief applications in which pain compliance would reasonably appear necessary 
to achieve control. 

208.4.4   TARGETING CONSIDERATIONS 
While manufacturers generally recommend that reasonable efforts should be made to target lower 
center mass and to avoid intentionally targeting the head, neck, chest and groin, it is recognized 
that  the  dynamics  of  each  situation  and  officer  safety  may  not  permit  the  officer  to  limit  the 
application  of  the  TASER  Device  darts  to  a  precise  target  area.  As  such,  officers  should  take 
prompt and ongoing care to monitor the condition of the subject if one or more darts strikes the 
head, neck, chest or groin until he is released to the care of paramedics or other medical personnel. 

208.4.5   MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS OF THE TASER DEVICE 
Only  one  officer  shall  deploy  his  TASER  Device  on  an  individual  unless  it  is  obvious  the 
deployment was not effective. 

(a) 

If the first application of the TASER Device appears to be ineffective in gaining control of 
an  individual  and  if  circumstances  allow,  the  officer  should  consider  the  following  before 
additional application of the TASER Device:

208.5   MEDICAL TREATMENT 
Officers will remove TASER Device darts as trained once the subject is in custody. Used TASER 
Device  darts  shall  be  considered  a  sharp  biohazard,  similar  to  a  used  hypodermic  needle. 
Universal precautions should be taken accordingly. 

All subjects who have been struck by TASER Device darts or who have been subjected to the 
electric  discharge  of  the  device  shall  be  medically  assessed  prior  to  booking.  Additionally,  an 
individual  who  falls  under  any  of  the  following  categories  should,  as  soon  as  practicable,  be 
examined by paramedics or other qualified medical personnel: 

(a)  The  subject  is  suspected  of  being  under  the  influence  of  controlled  substances  and/or 

alcohol. 

(b)     The subject may be pregnant. 

(c)     The subject reasonably appears to be in need of medical attention. 

(d)  The  TASER  Device  darts  are  lodged  in  a  sensitive  area  (e.g.,  groin,  female  breast,  near 

the eyes). 

(e)     The subject requests medical attention. 

Subjects  who  exhibit  extreme  agitation,  violent  irrational  behavior  accompanied  by  profuse 
sweating,  extraordinary  strength  beyond  their  physical  characteristics,  imperviousness  to  pain 
(sometimes called "excited delirium") or who require a protracted physical encounter with multiple 
officers to be brought under control, may be at an increased risk of sudden death and should be 
examined by qualified medical personnel as soon as practicable. Any individual exhibiting signs 
of distress after such an encounter shall be medically cleared prior to booking. 

If any individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal should be witnessed by another officer 
and/or medical personnel and shall be fully documented in related reports. If an audio recording is 
made of the contact or the interview with the individual, any refusal should be included, if possible. 

The  transporting  officer  shall  inform  any  person  receiving  custody  or  any  person  placed  in  a 
position of providing care that the individual has been subjected to the application of the TASER 
Device. All subjects shall be evaluated by the jail nurse prior to booking. 

208.6   TRAINING 
In addition to the initial department-approved training required to carry and use a TASER Device, 
all employees carrying a TASER Device shall demonstrate proficiency annually. 

(a)  Employees  who  have  not  carried  a  TASER  Device  as  a  part  of  their  assignment  for  a 
period of six months or more shall be recertified by a department approved TASER Device 
instructor prior to again carrying or using the device. 

(b)  A reassessment of an officer's knowledge and/or practical skill may be required at any time 

if deemed appropriate by the Training commander.

211.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This directive sets forth Department policy and procedures for inquiring, reporting, and reviewing 
force incidents in response to resistance involving Department personnel. The specific required 
inquiry,  reporting,  and  review  of  these  incidents  is  determined  by  the  force  level,  as  defined  in 
this policy. 

Personnel may delay compliance with the provisions of this order if the scene is unstable, there is 
unrest, or other conditions make immediate compliance impracticable. The protection of the public, 
Department personnel, and maintenance of public safety shall remain a top priority. Compliance 
with  this  order  shall  occur  as  soon  as  practicable.  The  approving  supervisor  shall  ensure  the 
reason for the delay is documented in the supervisor's supplement or inquiry memorandum. 

211.1.1   DEFINITIONS 
Inquiry:  The  preliminary  review  of  the  events  surrounding  a  response  to  resistance  incident, 
including the initial response to the scene and follow-up investigations. 

Reporting: The process of documenting the information gathered in the inquiry of a response to 
resistance incident through written, oral and visual means and compiling that information into the 
appropriate packet for review. 

Review: The process of evaluating all the given information obtained in the force incident inquiry 
and reporting stages to determine if the response to resistance was objectively reasonable and 
within policy guidelines. 

211.1.2   IDENTIFYING RESPONSE TO RESISTANCE DOCUMENTATION 
The following Response to Resistance reports and forms are required as determined by the force 
level of the incident: 

Response  to  Resistance  Incident  Report:  The  initial  incident  report  written  by  the  primary 
reporting  employee  for  all  force  level  incidents.  Title  Code  8400  shall  be  added to  the  incident 
report  by  the  primary  reporting  employee  to  identify  the  incident  as  a  response  to  resistance 
incident. The Use of Force section of the "Details" page shall also be completed. 

Response to Resistance Supplement: A supplement written to the primary reporting employee's 
incident report. 

Response to Resistance SIU Inquiry Report: A separate incident report written by the Special 
Investigations Unit (SIU) for all Level 1 incidents and in-custody deaths. 

Response to Resistance Level 2 Inquiry Control Sheet (PD0060): A coversheet completed by 
the supervisor for all Level 2 incidents.

•        Level 2 inquiry packets are completed by the supervisor conducting the inquiry. 

•        Level  3  incidents  do  not  require  an  inquiry  packet  as  documentation  is  handled  through 

Versadex case notes. 

211.2   DETERMINING THE CORRECT FORCE LEVEL 
Force levels are broken up into three types: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Each level is defined 
below by the response to resistance used in the incident. These levels are established for inquiry, 
reporting,  and  review  purposes  only.  If  there  is  uncertainty  about  which  level  to  designate  a 
particular incident then the higher level shall be used. 

211.2.1   LEVEL 1 FORCE INCIDENTS AND IN-CUSTODY DEATHS 

(a)  Any force resulting in death. 

(b)     Any force that resulted in a substantial risk of death.

emergency room treatment and release (e.g., serious disfigurement, disability, or protracted 
loss or impairment of the functioning of any body part or organ). 

(f)  Use of any impact weapon, including kinetic energy projectiles, and improvised weapons, 

that strikes the head of a subject. 

(g) 

In-Custody  Deaths:  For  inquiry,  reporting,  and  review  purposes,  all  in-custody  deaths 
occurring prior to or within 24 hours after booking shall be treated as Level 1 incidents and 
require concurrent inquiries conducted by SIU and IA, regardless of whether force was used 
on the subject. 

211.2.2   LEVEL 2 FORCE INCIDENTS 

(a)     Any strike to the head by an employee with any weaponless technique. 

(b)  Use of any impact weapons, including kinetic energy projectiles (other than a Taser), and 
improvised weapons, to strike a subject and contact is made, regardless of injury. (A strike 
to the head is a Level 1).

Austin Police Department 
Policy Manual

 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Vehicle Pursuits 

214.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Vehicle pursuits expose innocent citizens, law enforcement officers, and fleeing violators to the 
risk of serious injury or death. The primary purpose of this policy is to provide officers with guidance 
in balancing the safety of the public and themselves against law enforcement's duty to apprehend 
violators of the law. Another purpose of this policy is to minimize the potential for pursuit-related 
crashes. Vehicular pursuits require officers to exhibit a high degree of common sense and sound 
judgment. Officers must not forget that the immediate apprehension of a subject is generally not 
more important than the safety of the public and pursuing officers. 

214.1.1   PHILOSOPHY 
Deciding whether to pursue a motor vehicle is a critical decision that must be made quickly and 
under difficult and unpredictable circumstances. In recognizing the risk to public safety created by 
vehicle pursuits, no officer or supervisor shall be criticized or disciplined for deciding not to engage 
in a vehicle pursuit due to the risk involved. This includes circumstances where department policy 
would permit the initiation or continuation of the pursuit. It is recognized that vehicle pursuits are 
not always predictable and decisions made pursuant to this policy shall be evaluated according 
to the totality of the circumstances reasonably available at the time of the pursuit. 

Officers must remember that the most important factors to the successful conclusion of a pursuit 
are  self-discipline  and  sound  professional  judgment.  Officers'  conduct  during  the  course  of  a 
pursuit must be objectively reasonable; that is, what a reasonable officer would do under the same 
circumstances. An unreasonable desire to apprehend a fleeing subject at all costs has no place 
in professional law enforcement. 

214.2   DEFINITIONS 
Channel  - A tactic designed to cause a violator's vehicle to follow a particular path by blocking 
side streets and/or exit ramps with a patrol unit that has its emergency lights on. 

Terminate - Deactivate lights and siren, and cease pursuit. 

Tire Deflation Device (TDD)  - A device that extends across the roadway designed to puncture 
the tires of the pursued vehicle. These are also known as Spikes or Tack Strips. 

Vehicle Pursuit - An active attempt by a law enforcement officer in a motor vehicle to apprehend 
the occupant(s) of another moving motor vehicle when the driver is not merely failing to stop at 
the direction of an officer using emergency lights and siren, but is actively attempting to evade 
apprehension or is continuing to commit further violation(s) of the law. 

214.3   PURSUIT CONSIDERATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS 
The following policy is established to provide officers with guidelines for driving with due regard 
and caution for the safety of all persons using the highway (as required by Tex. Transp. Code 
§ 546.005).

Vehicle Pursuits 

214.3.1   RESTRICTIONS ON VEHICLE PURSUITS 
Officers will not engage in a pursuit under any of the following circumstances: 

(a)  The subject evades after having committed only: 

Any Class C Offense, including traffic; or 

A non-hazardous traffic violation, regardless of the class of offense. 

(b)     The  subject  is  committing,  or  has  committed,  only  a  misdemeanor  other  than  suspected 

DWI/DUI, and his identity is known to the officer. 

(c)  The  officer  has  a  prisoner,  subject,  or  other  non-police  passenger  who  has  not  signed  a 

liability release. 

(d)  The road surface is wet or otherwise slippery, unless the violator has committed a felony 
involving  violence,  and  then only  when  all  considerations for  safety  have been taken  into 
account and the pursuit is still deemed reasonable. 

214.3.2   FACTORS TO CONSIDER BEFORE INITIATING A PURSUIT 
With the exception of the specified restrictions on vehicle pursuits listed in this policy, officers are 
authorized to initiate a pursuit when it is reasonable to believe that a subject is attempting to evade 
arrest or detention by fleeing in a vehicle. 

(a)  The  following  factors  will  be  considered  both  individually  and  collectively  when  deciding 

whether to initiate or continue a pursuit: 

Seriousness  of  the  known  or  reasonably  suspected  crime  and  its  relationship  to 
community safety. 

The  importance  of  protecting  the  public  and  balancing  the  known  or  reasonably 
suspected offense and the apparent need for immediate capture against the risks to 
officers, innocent motorists, and others. 

Apparent nature of the fleeing subject (e.g., whether the subject represents a serious 
threat to public safety). 

Extended  pursuits  of  violators  for  misdemeanors  not  involving  violence  or  risk  of 
serious harm (independent of the pursuit) are discouraged. 

The identity of the subject has been verified and there is comparatively minimal risk 
in allowing the subject to be apprehended at a later time. 

Safety of the public in the area of the pursuit, including the type of area, time of day, 
the amount of vehicular and pedestrian traffic (e.g., school zones) and the speed of 
the pursuit relative to these factors. 

Pursuing  officer's  familiarity  with  the  area  of  the  pursuit,  the  quality  of  radio 
communications between the pursuing units and the dispatcher/supervisor and the 
driving capabilities of the pursuing officers under the conditions of the pursuit.

12.  Availability of other resources such as aircraft assistance. 

214.3.3   WHEN TO TERMINATE A PURSUIT 
Pursuits  should  be  discontinued  whenever  the  totality  of  objective  circumstances  known,  or 
which  reasonably  ought  to  be  known,  to  the  officer  or  supervisor  during  the  pursuit  indicates 
that the present risks of continuing the pursuit reasonably appear to outweigh the risks resulting 
from the subject's escape. Officers and supervisors must objectively and continuously weigh the 
seriousness of the offense against the potential danger to motorists, themselves, and the public 
when electing to continue a pursuit. This section shall not be construed to authorize a pursuit that 
is expressly prohibited as outlined in the Restrictions on Vehicle Pursuits section of this policy. 

(a)  The factors listed in this policy on when to initiate a pursuit are expressly included herein and 
shall also apply to the decision to discontinue a pursuit. In addition to those factors listed, 
the following should also be considered in deciding whether to terminate a pursuit: 

1.  Distance between the pursuing officers and the fleeing vehicle is so great that further 
pursuit  would  be  futile  or  require  the  pursuit  to  continue  for  an  unreasonable  time 
or distance. 

2. 

Pursued vehicle's location is no longer definitely known. 

3.  Officers  shall  discontinue  the  pursuit  when  they  become  aware  their  vehicle  has 

developed a mechanical malfunction. This includes, but is not limited to: 

(a)  Any engine warning light activates on the dash (e.g., brake, ABS, or check 

engine lights). 

(b)  Audible warning tones. 

(c)  Physical   damage   that   affects   the   performance,   maneuverability,   or 

functioning of the vehicle. 

4.  Hazards to uninvolved bystanders or motorists. 

5. 

If the identity of the offender is known and it does not reasonably appear that the need 
for  immediate  capture  outweighs  the  risks  associated  with  continuing  the  pursuit, 
officers  should  strongly  consider  discontinuing  the  pursuit  and  apprehending  the 
offender at a later time.

214.3.4   PURSUIT DRIVING CONSIDERATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS 
The  decision  to  use  specific  driving  tactics  requires  the  same  assessment  of  factors  to  be 
considered concerning pursuit initiation and termination. The following driving tactics apply to units 
involved in a pursuit: 

(a)  Officers will space themselves from other involved vehicles, in consideration of their driving 
skills  and  vehicle performance  capabilities,  so  they  are  able to see  and  avoid hazards  or 
react safely to maneuvers by the fleeing vehicle and other police units. 

(b)  Officers  should  not  attempt  to  pass  other  units  in  a  pursuit  unless  the  situation  indicates 

otherwise or requested to do so by the primary unit or control supervisor. 

(c) 

In  the  event  that  the  pursued  vehicle  drives  the  wrong  way  on  a  roadway,  the  following 
tactics should be used: 

1.  Request Air Support assistance. 

2. 

If a divided roadway, maintain visual contact with the pursued vehicle by paralleling 
on the correct side. 

3.  Request other units to watch for exits available to the vehicle. 

(d)  Officers will not pursue a vehicle driving the wrong way on a: 

1.  Highway or Freeway, 

2.  Highway or Freeway frontage / service roads, or 

3. 

any roadways that are: 

(a)  directly connected to highway/freeway entry or exit ramps, or 

(b)  adjacent to or running parallel to a highway or freeway. 

(e)     Officers have an obligation to drive with a due regard for the safety of lives and property. 
Driving  the  wrong  way  on  a  roadway  does  not  necessarily  protect  the  officer  from  the 
consequences of a disregard for traffic and/or legal restrictions.

214.4   PURSUIT GUIDELINES 
Pursuit  units  shall  be  limited  to  three  vehicles  (two  units  and  a control  supervisor);  however,  a 
control  supervisor  may  request  additional  units  to  join  a  pursuit  if,  after  assessing  the  factors 
outlined above, it appears that the number of officers involved would be insufficient to safely stop 
the  pursuit  and/or  arrest  the  subject(s).  All  other  officers  will  stay  out  of  the  pursuit  but  should 
remain alert to its progress and location. 

(a)     All officers involved in a pursuit shall: 

1.  Operate their police unit with emergency lights and siren activated (Code 3). 

2. 

Ensure their Mobile Audio Video (MAV) recording system has been activated if their 
vehicle is equipped with one. 

(b)  Any officer who drops out of a pursuit may, with permission of a control supervisor, trail the 
pursuit to the termination point in order to provide necessary information and assistance in 
the arrest of the subject(s). 

The term "trail" means to follow the path of the pursuit at a safe speed while obeying 
all traffic laws and without activating emergency equipment. If the pursuit is at a slow 
rate of speed, the trailing unit will maintain sufficient distance from the pursuit units 
so as to clearly indicate an absence of participation in the pursuit. 

(c)     Pursuit communications shall be handled as follows: 

If   a   pursuit   is   confined   within   the   City   limits,   radio   communications   will   be 
conducted  on  the  primary  channel  unless  instructed  otherwise  by  a  supervisor  or 
communications dispatcher. 

If    a    pursuit    contains    multiple    agencies    and/or    leaves    APD    jurisdiction, 
Communications will determine the appropriate radio channel to use.

214.4.3   UNITS NOT INVOLVED IN A PURSUIT 

(a)  There shall be no paralleling of a pursuit route by officers not authorized to be in a pursuit. 

(b)  Officers not directly involved in the pursuit are authorized to proceed safely to controlled 
intersections  ahead  of  the  pursuit  and  use  emergency  equipment  to  warn  vehicular  and 
pedestrian traffic in an effort to protect the public. Officers should remain in their assigned 
area  and  should  not  become  involved  with  the  pursuit  unless  directed  otherwise  by  a 
supervisor. 

(c)  Non-pursuing  personnel  needed  at  the  termination  of  a  pursuit  should  respond  in  the 
appropriate  manner  based  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  and  type  of  assistance 
needed. 

214.4.4   SUPERVISORS INITIATING A PURSUIT 

(a)  When a supervisor initiates a pursuit, another supervisor working in the same area should 
acknowledge the pursuit over the radio and assume responsibility as the control supervisor. 

If  a  supervisor  in  the  same  area  is  unavailable,  and  no  supervisor  volunteers  as 
control supervisor, Communications shall notify the nearest available field supervisor 
that a control supervisor is needed. Corporals serving as acting sergeants may not 
assume responsibility as the control supervisor in this situation. 

2. 

Acknowledgment by the appointed control supervisor must be made by radio. 

(b)  The supervisor who initiates the pursuit may continue pursuing the subject vehicle until such 

time as patrol units are able to assist, or the pursuit is terminated. 

As authorized patrol units engage the pursuit, the initiating supervisor will allow those 
units  to take up the first  and  subsequent  positions  behind  the  subject  vehicle and 
call the pursuit. 

The initiating supervisor shall move to the last position behind the authorized units 
and assume the role of control supervisor. 

(c)  Once the initiating supervisor is in a position to assume the role of control supervisor, they 
shall advise Communications by radio that they are now control supervisor and the previous 
control supervisor shall be relieved. 

(d)  The supervisor acting as control supervisor at the conclusion of the pursuit shall complete 

all appropriate paperwork. 

1. 

Any  other  supervisor  who  acted  as  control  supervisor,  or  became  involved  in 
a  supervisory  capacity  at  any  time  during  the  pursuit,  shall  write  a  supplement 
documenting his involvement.

214.4.5   PURSUITS INITIATED BY OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 
The  agency  that  initiates  a  pursuit  shall  be  responsible  for  conducting  the  pursuit.  Units  from 
this department should not participate in, join, or assume control of a pursuit initiated by another 
agency  unless  approved  by  a  supervisor  or  the  Watch  Lieutenant.  As  soon  as  practicable,  a 
supervisor or the Watch Lieutenant should review a request for assistance from another agency 
to determine if assistance will be provided. 

(a)  At  no  time  should  a  request  to  join  or  take  over  a  pursuit  from  another  agency  that  has 
entered this jurisdiction be granted if it violates the considerations and restrictions on vehicle 
pursuits outlined in this policy, with the following exceptions: 

1. 

2. 

Authorization  to  participate  in  the  pursuit  may  be  granted  for  the  sole  purpose  of 
ending the pursuit using TDD's or other approved devices and methods as outlined 
in this policy, regardless of the reason for the pursuit. 

In  the  event  that  a  pursuit  from  another  agency  terminates  within  this  jurisdiction, 
approval may be given to provide appropriate assistance to officers from the allied 
agency  including,  but  not  limited  to,  scene  control,  containment,  subject  search, 
completion of supplemental reports, and any other assistance requested or needed. 

(b)  Pursuit assistance to an allied agency by officers of this department should terminate at the 
City limits. Ongoing participation from this department may only continue with the approval 
of a supervisor. 

214.4.6   APD PURSUITS ENTERING OTHER JURISDICTIONS 

(a)  Officers should request communications to notify the appropriate law enforcement agency 

when it appears that the pursuit may enter another jurisdiction. 

(b)  When  a  pursuit  enters  another  agency's  jurisdiction,  the  primary  officer  or  supervisor 
should determine whether to request the other agency to assume the pursuit by taking into 
consideration distance traveled, unfamiliarity with the area, and other pertinent factors. 

214.4.7   LOSS OF PURSUED VEHICLE AND SUBJECT BAILING 

(a)  When the pursued vehicle is lost, the primary unit should broadcast pertinent information to 
assist other units in locating the vehicle. The control supervisor will determine if the pursuit 
should be terminated and whether Air Support should continue searching the area. 

(b)  When subjects abandon the vehicle and flee on foot, the primary unit will be responsible for 

coordinating any further search with the permission of the control supervisor. 

214.5   PURSUIT UNIT ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES 
This section outlines the roles and responsibilities of police units involved in a pursuit. 

214.5.1   PRIMARY UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES

(b)  Unless  relieved  by  a  supervisor  or  secondary  unit,  the  officer  in  the  primary  unit  shall 
be  responsible for  the  broadcasting  of  the  progress  of  the  pursuit.  Unless  circumstances 
reasonably  indicate  otherwise,  the  primary  unit  should  relinquish  the  responsibility  of 
broadcasting the  progress  of the  pursuit to  a  secondary  unit  or  aircraft joining  the  pursuit 
to minimize distractions and allow the primary unit to concentrate foremost on safe pursuit 
tactics. 

214.5.2   SECONDARY UNIT(S) RESPONSIBILITIES 

(a)  The second officer in the pursuit is responsible for the following: 

Immediately notify the dispatcher of entry into the pursuit.

214.5.5   AIR SUPPORT RESPONSIBILITIES 
Once the Air Unit has established visual contact with the pursued vehicle and is capable, it should 
start calling the actions of the pursuit to allow ground units to focus on driving. The primary and 
secondary ground units should consider the participation of aircraft assistance when determining 
whether to continue the pursuit. 

(a)  The Air Unit should coordinate the activities of resources on the ground, report progress of 
the pursuit and provide officers and supervisors with details of upcoming traffic congestion, 
road hazards or other pertinent information to evaluate whether to continue the pursuit.  If 
ground  units  are  not  within  visual  contact  and the  Air  Unit  determines  that  it  is  unsafe to 
continue the pursuit, the Air Unit should recommend terminating the pursuit. 

(b)  Once  a  vehicle  pursuit  has  been  terminated,  the  Tactical  Flight  Officer  may  request 
permission from the control supervisor to allow the Air Unit to track the subject. If permission 
is granted to track, the Air Unit will advise location and any pertinent information relative to 
the  safety  of  the  public. If  the  Air  Unit  indicates that  the  subject  vehicle has  stopped,  the 
control supervisor may authorize ground units to proceed to the vehicle location. The control 
supervisor shall determine the manner in which units respond. 

1. 

2. 

If  the  control  supervisor  denies  permission  to  track,  the  Air  Unit  will  break  off  all 
contact with the subject. 

If  the  Air  Unit  determines,  in  the  interest  of  safety,  that  it  can  no  longer  assist  or 
continue tracking the subject, the Air Unit shall notify the control supervisor. 

214.5.6   WATCH LIEUTENANT RESPONSIBILITIES 
Upon becoming aware that a pursuit has been initiated, the Watch Lieutenant should monitor and 
continually assess the situation. 

214.6   APPROVED PURSUIT INTERVENTION AND TERMINATION TACTICS 
Any approved tactic, depending upon the conditions and circumstances under which it is used, 
may  present  dangers  to  the  officers,  the  public,  or  anyone  in  the  vehicle  being  pursued.  It  is 
imperative that officers act within the bounds of legality, good judgment, accepted practices, and 
policy. 

(a)  Certain applications of intervention and termination tactics may be construed to be a use 
of force,  including  deadly  force,  and  are  subject to  Department  policies guiding  such  use 
and reporting. 

(b) 

In deciding whether to use an approved tactic, officers and supervisors should balance the 
risks of allowing the pursuit to continue with the potential hazards arising from the use of each 
tactic to the public, the officers, and subjects in or on the pursued vehicle. With these risks 
in mind, the decision to use any tactic should be reasonable in light of the circumstances 
apparent to the officer at the time of the decision.

(c)  Unless  exigency  exists,  the  use  of  intervention  tactics  should  be  employed  only  after 

approval of a supervisor. 

214.6.1   USE OF FIREARMS 
Officers should exercise good judgment and not place themselves in the path of a moving vehicle 
since doing so may increase the likelihood of having to resort to the use of deadly force. 

(a)  Unless  it  reasonably  appears  that  it  would  endanger  officers  or  the  public,  officers  are 

expected to move out of the path of any approaching vehicle. 

(b)     Officers shall adhere to the guidelines set forth in Policy 202 (Firearm Discharge Situations) 

in regards to the discharge of a firearm at or from a moving vehicle. 

214.6.2   TIRE DEFLATION DEVICE (TDD) 
The use of a Tire Deflation Device (TDD) should be approved in advance by the control supervisor 
and deployed only when it is reasonably apparent that only the pursued vehicle will be affected 
by  their  use.  Officers  should  carefully  consider  the  limitations  of  such  devices  as  well  as  the 
potential risks to officers, the public and occupants of the pursued vehicle. If the pursued vehicle is 
transporting hazardous materials, or a school bus transporting children, officers and supervisors 
should weigh the potential consequences against the need to immediately stop the vehicle. 

(a)  TDD's shall not be used when a motorcycle is involved in the pursuit. 

(b)  TDD Deployment 

1.  Only officers who have received and successfully completed Department approved 
training  in the  application  and use  of  an  approved  TDD  shall  use this  intervention 
tactic. 

2. 

The following scenarios require supervisor approval prior to TDD deployment: 

(a)  The  fleeing  vehicle  has  made  overt  attempts  to  strike  any  other  vehicles, 

persons, or structure during the pursuit, or 

(b)  There is a reasonable belief that the suspect is armed (independent witness 

claims, self-admittance, multiple victim statements, etc.) 

3.  Officers who are driving units equipped with a TDD and are authorized to deploy the 

TDD may proceed Code 3 to a location likely to be in path of the pursuit. 

4. 

TDD  units  shall  advise  Communications  when  they  have  reached  the  deployment 
site and give their location. 

5. 

Prior to deploying TDD officers shall consider the following: 

(a)  The need to continue pursuit versus terminating the pursuit in the event the 

deployment of TDDs are ineffective; 

(b)  The risk to the public or pursuing law enforcement vehicles caused by the 

deployment of the TDD; and,

(c)  The hazard to the occupants of the pursued vehicle. 

6. 

After a deployment site has been established, the control supervisor may authorize 
other units to operate Code 3 in order to channel the fleeing vehicle to this location. 

(a)  Channeling may include blocking freeway exits and/or major side streets. 

(b)  Police units shall not attempt to make a fleeing vehicle take any action other 
than continuing straight on the road upon which it is already traveling. 

(c)  Police  units  shall  activate  all  emergency  lighting  while  blocking  exits  or 

streets. 

7. 

The officer calling the pursuit shall broadcast the identity of the target vehicle to the 
TDD unit when the pursuit approaches the deployment site. The information should 
include details of the vehicle such as license plate, color, make and model. 

(a)  The target vehicle should be visually confirmed by the TDD unit to reduce 

errors in deployment. 

(b)  All pursuing units should maintain at least a three to five second gap behind 
the target vehicle to allow sufficient time for the setup and retrieval of the TDD. 

(c)  Pursuing vehicles should proceed cautiously upon approaching and crossing 

the TDD site. 

214.6.3   LOW SPEED INTERVENTION 
Police vehicles shall not be used to physically force a pursued vehicle off the roadway or to a stop, 
or to otherwise change its direction of travel or alter its speed unless: 

(a)     The pursued vehicle is at a stop or near stop; and 

(b)     The police vehicle is maneuvering at low speed; and 

(c)     Doing so would reduce or eliminate the risk associated with the pursuit continuing. 

Before engaging in such actions, officers must consider the unintended consequences of the low 
speed intervention and recognize that a better course of action may be to terminate the pursuit 
altogether. 

214.6.4   STARCHASE PURSUIT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
The StarChase system allows an officer to remotely affix a GPS tracking device to a pursued (or 
about to be pursued) vehicle using an air pressure system to discharge the tracker from the front 
of the StarChase equipped patrol car to the vehicle in front of it. Once the tracker is affixed, its 
location can be tracked by an employee (StarChase Monitor) using a computer with an internet 
connection. This concept is similar to a RAT/GPS.

(b)  StarChase equipment in the patrol vehicle will only be operated by officers who have been 
trained in its use. StarChase equipped vehicles will not be assigned to officers who are not 
trained on its use unless required by exigent circumstances. 

(c)  Except  as  specified  below,  officers  shall  use  their  own  judgment  regarding  affixing  a 

StarChase tag upon a pursued vehicle and do not need prior approval from a supervisor: 

(a)  All safety decisions related to the discharge of a StarChase tag rest with the 
operating  officer.  While  supervisors  may  direct  or  approve  the  deployment 
of  a  StarChase  equipped  patrol  car  in  a  pursuit  and/or  the  discharge  of  a 
tag, safety decisions related to passing other involved vehicles and the actual 
discharge of the device rest solely upon the operating officer whose decisions 
must  take  into  account  the  guidelines  contained  in  this  Special  Order  and 
the  APD  policy  regarding  pursuits.  In  accordance  with  policy,  the  safety  of 
officers, uninvolved persons and persons inside the pursued vehicle shall be 
considered. The following decisions are specifically included: 

(a)  Whether the officer can safely maneuver close enough to the suspect 

vehicle to come within targeting range. 

(b)  Whether the officer can safely pass any other vehicle involved in the 

pursuit. 

(c)  Whether any circumstance would indicate the device would not work 

(e.g. weather conditions, suspect vehicle weaving, etc.) 

(d)  StarChase equipped patrol cars, with approval from a supervisor, are authorized to respond 

Code 3 to join a pursuit for potential use of the device. 

(a)  Unless  directed  otherwise,  the  StarChase  equipped  vehicle  will  join  the 
pursuit at the rear of authorized pursuing vehicles until cleared to pass. 

(b)  Once a StarChase equipped vehicle joins a pursuit, it becomes an authored 

unit as it relates to the number of authorized pursuing vehicle. 

(c)  StarChase  equipped  vehicles  may  pass  other  pursuing  vehicles  only  when 
deemed safe and only with specific permission from the unit to be passed. 
Permission  is  to  be  sought  and  acknowledged  one  passing  at  a  time. 
Officers driving the StarChase equipped vehicle will identify which side of the 
overtaken vehicle they will pass. 

(a)  Once the StarChase tag has been successfully deployed, pursuing vehicles 

should normally drop back significantly from the suspect vehicle. 

(b)  Officers will maintain constant communication with the StarChase Monitor for 

speed/direction/location updates of the suspect vehicle. 

(c)  The Control Supervisor will coordinate with the StarChase Monitor to direct 

resources and officers to appropriate locations to apprehend the suspect. 

(e)  StarChase tags will be deployed in accordance with training.

Policy Manual

 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Foot Pursuits 

215.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Foot pursuits are inherently dangerous and require common sense, sound tactics, and heightened 
officer safety awareness. This policy sets forth guidelines to assist officers in making the decision 
to initiate or continue the pursuit of subjects on foot. 

215.1.1   POLICY 
It is the policy of this department when deciding to initiate or continue a foot pursuit that officers 
must continuously balance the objective of apprehending the subject with the risk and  potential 
for injury to department personnel, the public, or the subject. 

Officers  are  expected  to  act  reasonably  based  on  the  totality  of  the  circumstances.  Absent 
exigent circumstances, the safety of department personnel and the public should be the primary 
consideration when determining whether a foot pursuit should be initiated or continued. Officers 
must be mindful that immediate apprehension of a subject is rarely more important than the safety 
of the public and Department personnel. 

215.2   DECISION TO PURSUE 
Officers may be justified in initiating a foot pursuit of any individual the officer reasonably believes 
is about to engage in, is engaging in, or has engaged in criminal activity. The decision to initiate 
or  continue  such  a  foot  pursuit,  however,  must  be  continuously  re-evaluated  in  light  of  the 
circumstances presented at the time. 

Mere  flight  by  a  subject  who  is  not  suspected  of  criminal  activity  shall  not  serve  as  the  sole 
justification  for  engaging  in  a  foot  pursuit  without  the  development  of  reasonable  suspicion 
regarding the individual's involvement in criminal activity. 

Deciding to initiate or continue a foot pursuit is a decision that an officer must make quickly and 
under  unpredictable  and  dynamic  circumstances.  It  is  recognized  that  foot  pursuits  potentially 
place department personnel and the public at significant risk. Therefore, no officer or supervisor 
shall  be  criticized  or  disciplined  for  deciding  not  to  engage  in  a  foot  pursuit  because  of  the 
perceived risk involved. 

If  circumstances  permit,  surveillance  and  containment  are  generally  the  safest  tactics  for 
apprehending fleeing subjects. In deciding whether to initiate or continue a foot pursuit, an officer 
should  continuously  consider  reasonable  alternatives  to  pursuit  based  upon  the  circumstances 
and resources available, such as the following: 

(a)  Containment of the area. 

(b)  Canine search. 

(c)  Saturation of the area with patrol personnel. 

(d)  Air support.

(e)  Apprehension at another time when the identity of the subject is known or there is information 
available  that  would  likely  allow  for  later  apprehension,  and  the  need  to  immediately 
apprehend the subject does not reasonably appear to outweigh the risk of continuing the 
pursuit. 

215.3   FOOT PURSUIT CONSIDERATIONS 
An  order  by  a  supervisor to  terminate  a foot  pursuit  shall  be  promptly  obeyed.  Officers  should 
consider alternatives to engaging in or continuing a foot pursuit under the following conditions: 

(a)  When the officer is acting alone. 

(b)  When  two  or  more  officers  become  separated,  lose  visual  contact  with  one  another  or 
obstacles separate them to the degree that they cannot immediately assist each other should 
a confrontation take place. In such circumstances, it is generally recommended that a single 
officer keep the subject in sight from a safe distance and coordinate the containment effort. 

(c)  The officer is unsure of his location and direction of travel. 

(d)  When pursuing multiple subjects and the pursuing officers do not reasonably believe that 

they would be able to control the subjects should a confrontation occur. 

(e)  When the physical condition of the officers renders them incapable of controlling the subject 

if apprehended. 

(f)  When the officer loses radio contact with Communications or with backup officers. 

(g)  When  the  subject  enters  a  building,  structure,  confined  space,  or  a  wooded  or  otherwise 
isolated  area  and  there  are  insufficient  officers  to  provide  backup  and  containment.  The 
primary  officer  should  consider  discontinuing  the  pursuit  and  coordinating  containment 
pending the arrival of sufficient officers. 

(h)  The officer becomes aware of unanticipated or unforeseen circumstances that unreasonably 

increase the risk to officers or the public. 

(i) 

The  officer  reasonably  believes  that  the  danger  to  the  pursuing  officers  or  to  the  public 
outweighs the objective of immediate apprehension. 

(j) 

The officer loses possession of his firearm or other essential equipment. 

(k)  The officer or a third party is injured during the pursuit, requiring immediate assistance and 

there are no other emergency personnel available to render aid. 

(l) 

The subject's location is no longer definitely known. 

(m)  The  identity  of  the  subject  is  established  or  other  information  exists that will  allow  for  the 
subject's apprehension at a later time, and it reasonably appears that there is no immediate 
threat to department personnel or the public if the subject is not immediately apprehended. 

(n)  The officer's ability to safely continue the pursuit is impaired by inclement weather, darkness, 

or other conditions.

215.4   RESPONSIBILITIES IN FOOT PURSUITS 

215.4.1   INITIATING OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES 
Unless  relieved  by  another  officer  or  a  supervisor,  the  initiating  officer  shall  be  responsible  for 
coordinating the progress of the pursuit. 

(a)  Early communication of available information from the involved officers is essential so that 
adequate  resources  can  be  coordinated  and  deployed  to  bring  a  foot  pursuit  to  a  safe 
conclusion.  Officers  initiating  a  foot  pursuit  should  broadcast  the  following  information  as 
soon as it becomes practicable and available: 

1.  Unit identifier. 

2. 

Location and direction of travel. 

3.  Reason for the foot pursuit. 

4.  Number of subjects and description. 

5.  Whether the subject is known or believed to be armed. 

(b)  Officers  are  reminded  that  radio  transmissions  made  while  running  may  be  difficult  to 

understand and may need to be repeated. 

(c)  Absent extenuating circumstances, any officer unable to promptly and effectively broadcast 
this information should terminate the pursuit. If the foot pursuit is discontinued for any reason, 
immediate efforts for containment should be established and alternatives considered based 
upon the circumstances and available resources. 

(d)  When a foot pursuit terminates, the officer shall notify Communications of his location and 
the status of the pursuit termination (e.g., subject in custody, lost sight of subject), and shall 
direct further actions as reasonably appear necessary. 

215.4.2   ASSISTING OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES 
Whenever  any  officer  announces  that  he  is  engaged  in  a  foot  pursuit,  all  other  officers  should 
minimize non-essential radio traffic to permit the involved officers maximum access to the radio 
frequency. 

Officers  in  a  position  to  intercept  a  fleeing  subject,  or  who  can  assist  the  primary  officer  with 
the  containment  or  apprehension  of  the  subject,  shall  act  reasonably  and  in  accordance  with 
Department policy based upon available information and their own observations. 

215.4.3   CONTROL SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY 
It is the policy of this department that supervisor control shall be exercised over all foot pursuits 
involving officers from this department. 

(a)  The immediate supervisor of the officer initiating the foot pursuit, or if unavailable, the nearest 

available field supervisor shall assume the responsibility as the control supervisor.

immediately  available  in  that  area;  however,  corporals  may  not  be  the  control  supervisor 
when a sergeant initiates a foot pursuit. 

(c)  The control supervisor is responsible for the following: 

1.  Upon  becoming  aware  of  a  foot  pursuit,  immediately  ascertaining  all  reasonably

Patrol Function 

300.2.1   CRIME ANALYSIS UNIT 
The  Crime  Analysis  Unit  (CAU)  will  be  the  central  unit  for  information  exchange.  Criminal 
information and intelligence reports can be submitted to the Central Records for distribution to all 
bureaus within the Department through daily and special bulletins. 

300.2.2   CRIME REPORTS 
A  crime  report  may  be  completed  by  any  patrol  officer  who  receives  criminal  information.  The 
report  will  be  processed  and  forwarded  to  the  appropriate  bureau  for  retention  or  follow-up 
investigation. 

300.2.3   PATROL BRIEFINGS 
Patrol  supervisors,  detective  sergeants  and  special  unit  sergeants  are  encouraged  to  share 
information as much as possible. All supervisors and/or officers will be provided an opportunity to 
share information at the daily patrol briefings as time permits. 

300.2.4   INFORMATION CLIPBOARDS 
Several  information  clipboards  will  be  maintained  in  the  briefing  room  and  will  be  available  for 
review by officers from all bureaus within the Department. These will include, but not be limited 
to, the patrol check clipboard, the wanted persons clipboard and the written directive clipboard. 

300.2.5   BULLETIN BOARDS 
A bulletin board will be kept in the briefing room and the Investigation Unit for display of suspect 
information, intelligence reports and photographs. New Special Orders will be made available for 
patrol  supervisors  and will  be  discussed  at  briefings  and  shift  meetings.  A  copy  of  the  Special 
Order will be placed on the briefing room clipboard. 

300.3   CROWDS, EVENTS AND GATHERINGS 
Officers  may  encounter  gatherings  of  people,  including  but  not  limited  to,  civil  demonstrations, 
civic, social and business events, public displays, parades and sporting events. Officers should 
monitor such events as time permits in an effort to keep the peace and protect the safety and rights 
of those present. A patrol supervisor should be notified when it becomes reasonably foreseeable 
that such an event may require increased monitoring, contact or intervention. 

Officers responding to an event or gathering that warrants law enforcement involvement should 
carefully balance the speech and association rights of those present with applicable public safety 
concerns  before  taking  enforcement  action.  Officers  are  encouraged  to  contact  organizers  or 
responsible persons to seek voluntary compliance that may address relevant public safety/order 
concerns. 

Officers should consider enforcement of applicable state and local laws, such as Tex. Penal Code 
§ 42.03  (Obstructing  Highway  or  Other  Passageway),  when the  activity  blocks the  entrance or 
egress of a facility or location and when voluntary compliance with the law is not achieved.

Austin Police Department 
Policy Manual

 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Responsibility to the Community 

301.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
All persons deserve protection by fair and impartial law enforcement and should be able to expect 
similar  police  response  to  their  behavior  wherever  it  occurs.  Employees  will  serve  the  public 
through direction, counseling, assistance, and protection of life and property. Employees will be 
held  accountable for the  manner  in  which they  exercise  the authority  of  their  office or  position. 
Employees will respect the rights of individuals and perform their services with honesty, sincerity, 
courage, and sound judgment. 

301.2   IMPARTIAL ATTITUDE AND COURTESY 
Employees  are  expected  to  act  professionally,  treat all  persons fairly  and  equally,  and  perform 
all duties impartially, objectively, and equitably without regard to personal feelings, animosities, 
friendships,  financial  status,  sex,  creed,  color,  race,  religion,  age,  political  beliefs,  sexual 
orientation, or social or ethnic background. 

(a)  Employees will not express or otherwise manifest any prejudice concerning race, religion, 
national  origin,  age,  political  affiliation,  sex,  or  other  personal  characteristics  in  the 
performance of their duties. 

1. 

2. 

Employees will respect the rights of individuals and will not engage in discrimination, 
oppression, or favoritism whether by language, act, or omission. 

The  use  of  racial  or  ethnic  remarks,  slurs,  epithets,  words  or  gestures,  which  are 
derogatory or inflammatory in nature to or about any person or group of persons is 
strictly prohibited. 

(b)  Employees will be tactful in the performance of their duties, control their tempers, exercise 
patience and discretion, and shall not engage in argumentative discussions even in the face 
of extreme provocation. 

(c)     Employees will make every effort to be courteous and respectful toward all persons. 

301.3   CUSTOMER SERVICE AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS 
APD  constantly  works  to  establish  direct  contacts  with  the  community  we  serve.  Without 
grassroots  community  support,  successful  enforcement  of  many  laws  may  be  difficult,  if  not 
impossible.  Community  involvement  can  be  an  effective  means  of  eliciting  public  support,  can 
serve to identify problems in the making, and may foster cooperative efforts in resolving community 
issues. Input from the community can also help ensure that agency policies accurately reflect the 
needs of the community. 

(a)  The conduct of each employee reflects on the agency as a whole and the burden of achieving 
the agency's community relations objectives is shared. A unified, coordinated effort requires 
the participation, enthusiasm, and skills of all agency personnel.

(b)  Employees will extend reasonable assistance to the public when called upon. Employees 
must  not  neglect  community  services  in  the  belief  that  the  police  function  is  restricted  to 
crime control. 

301.3.1   COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT AND RECRUITMENT PROGRAMS 

(a)  Police-Community cooperation can be obtained through open channels of communications, 
thus allowing for the discussion of concerns and problem areas within the community. All 
avenues  must  be  utilized  in  promoting  the  respect  and  cooperating  of the  public  with the 
police including, but not limited to:

Policy Manual

 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Public Recording of Official Acts 

302.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The  Austin  Police  Department  recognizes  that  members  of  the  general  public  have  a  First 
Amendment right to video record. photograph, and/or audio record APD officers while they are 
conducting official business or while acting in an official capacity in any public space, unless such 
recordings interfere with police activity. 

302.2   INTERACTION WITH COMMUNITY 

(a)  Officers  are  reminded  that  photography,  including  videotaping,  of  places,  buildings, 

structures and events are common and normally lawful activities. 

If a person is taking photographs or recording from a place where he or she has a right 
to be, officers are reminded that this activity by itself does not constitute suspicious 
conduct. 

(b) 

In areas open to the public, officers shall allow bystanders the same access for photography 
as is given to members of the news. Officers shall be aware that: 

A bystander has the same right to take photographs or make recordings as a member 
of the media, as long as the bystander has a legal right to be present where he or 
she is located. 

A bystander has the right under the First Amendment to observe and record officers 
in the public discharge of their duties. 

Public settings include parks, sidewalks, streets, and locations of public protests; but 
that protection extends also to an individual's home or business, common areas of 
public and private facilities and buildings, and any other public or private facility at 
which the individual has a legal right to be present. 

The fact that a bystander has a camera or other recording device does not, however, 
entitle the bystander to cross a police line, to enter an area that is closed to the public, 
or to enter any area designated as a crime scene. 

(c)  As long as the photographing or recording takes place in a setting at which the individual 
has a legal right to be present and does not interfere with an officer's safety or lawful duties, 
officer's shall not inform or instruct people that photographing or recording of police officers, 
police  activity  or  individuals  who  are the  subject of  police  action (such  as  a Terry  stop  or 
an arrest) is not allowed; requires a permit; or requires the officer's consent. Additionally, 
officers shall not: 

1.  Order that person to cease such activity; 

2.  Demand that person's identification;

3.  Demand  that  the  person  state  a  reason  why  he  or  she  is  taking  photographs  or 

Intentionally block or obstruct cameras or recording devices; or 

In any way threaten, intimidate or otherwise discourage an individual from recording 
officer's enforcement activities. 

(d)  Nothing  in  this  policy  prohibits  officers  from  questioning  or  detaining  individuals  they 
reasonably suspect have committed, are committing, or are about to commit any crime. 

(e)  Officers  are  reminded  that  a  person  commits  an  offense  if  the  person  with  criminal 
negligence interrupts, disrupts, impedes, or otherwise interferes with a peace officer while 
the peace officer is performing a duty or exercising authority imposed or granted by law. 

If a person is photographing or recording police activity from a position that impedes 
or interferes with the safety of officers or their ability to perform their duties, an officer 
may direct the person to move to a position that will not interfere. However, an officer 
shall not order the person to stop photographing or recording. 

If a person is photographing or recording police activity from a position that impedes 
or threatens the safety of members of the public, the officer shall direct the person 
to  move  to  a  safe  position.  However,  officers  shall  not  order  the  person  to  stop 
photographing or recording. 

A  person's  recording  of  officer's  activity  from  a  safe  distance,  and  absent  any 
attendant action that obstructs the activity or threatens the safety of the officers, does 
not constitute interference. 

A person has the right to express criticism of the police activity being observed. As 
long  as  that  expression  does  not  jeopardize  the  safety  of  any  officer,  suspect  or 
bystander; and so long as that expression does not violate the law or incite others to 
violate the law, the expression does not constitute interference. 

If an officer has probable cause to believe that a camera or other recording device 
contains images or sounds that are evidence of criminal acts, the officer shall request 
that the person either: 

(a)  allow the officer to listen to or view the recording 

(b)  Voluntarily provide the device or recording medium (e.g., the memory chip) 

to the officer; or 

(c)  Where possible and practicable, and in the presence of the officer, voluntarily 
transmit  the  images  or  sound  via  electronic  mail  to  the  officer's  official 
government electronic mail account.

otherwise access any material contained on the device. 

3. 

If  the  individual  declines  to  voluntarily  provide  the  device  or  recording  medium,  or 
to electronically transmit the sound and/or images where possible and practicable, 
and the officer believes that exigent circumstances exist insofar as the evidence of 
criminal  activity  will  be  lost  absent  an  immediate  seizure  of  the  device,  the  officer 
shall take control of the device and contact a supervisor 

(a)  The  Supervisor  shall,  in  consultation  with  the  officer,  determine  whether 
exigent  circumstances  permit  the  seizure  of  the  device  without  a  warrant. 
Warrantless seizure is permissible only when: 

1. 

2. 

There is probable cause to believe that the property holds contraband 
or evidence of a crime; and 

The  exigencies  of  the  circumstances  demand  it  or  some  other

3. 

Absent exigent circumstances, officers shall obtain a search warrant before viewing

seized as evidence. 

In exigent circumstances, where there is reason to believe that an immediate search 
of the seized material is necessary to prevent death or injury, officers shall contact a 
supervisor for authorization to review photographs or recordings without a warrant. 

Photographs or recordings that have been seized as evidence and are not directly 
related to the exigent purpose shall not be reviewed. 

(h)  Officers  shall  not,  under  any  circumstances,  erase  or  delete,  or  instruct  or  require  any 
other person to erase or delete, any recorded images or sounds from any camera or other 
recording.

Body Worn Digital Recording Systems 

303.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 

The  use  of  Body  Worn  Digital  Recording  (BWDR)  system  provides  an  unbiased  audio/ 
video   recording   of   events   that   employees   encounter.   These   recordings   can   be   useful 
for  the  documentation  of  evidence,  the  preparation  of  offense  reports,  and  future  court 
testimony. These recordings can also protect employees from false allegations of misconduct and 
be of use when debriefing incidents or evaluating performance. 

This policy covers the use of the Department issued and personally owned BWDR systems. 

303.2   DEPARTMENT ISSUED BODY WORN DIGITAL RECORDING 

(a)  Employees  equipped  with  a  department  issued  BWDR  system  must  be  trained  in  the 
operation of the equipment prior to its use. BWDR equipment will be used in accordance 
with the BWDR operations manual. 

(b)  Employees who discover an operational defect with the BWDR system will attempt to correct 
the system following the received training on the device (I.E.: Reseating cables, Cycling the 
power, etc.). If the BWDR is found to have a physical defect or malfunction, the Employee 
will notify the supervisor, and write up the device for service describing the events leading 
up to failure. 

(c)     Employees shall not: 

(a)  Bypass or attempt to override the equipment. 

(b)  Erase, alter, or delete any recording produced by the BWDR. 

303.2.1   WHEN DEPARTMENT ISSUED BWDR SYSTEM USE IS REQUIRED 
This section is not intended to describe every possible situation where the system may be used. 
In some circumstances it may not possible to capture images of an incident due to conditions or 
location of the camera, however the audio portion can be valuable evidence and is subject to the 
same activation requirements. 

(a)  All  units  responding  to  a  scene  shall  activate  their  department  issued  BWDR  equipment 

when they: 

(a)  Activate the DMAV recording prior to arriving on-scene; or 

(b)  Have detained or arrested a person; or 

(c)  Are attempting to detain or arrest a person; or 

(d)  By the nature of the call for service, are likely to detain or arrest a person. 

(b)  Examples of when the department issued BWDR system must be activated include, but are 

not limited to:

(e)     Investigatory stops 

(f)  Any contact that becomes adversarial in an incident that would not otherwise require 
recording. In those situations, it may be impractical or unreasonable for employees 
to activate their BWDR system before taking police action. It is expected that once 
the immediacy of the situation is over, employees will activate their BWDR system 
to record the remainder of the incident. 

(c) 

In  addition  to  the  required  situations,  employees  may  activate  the  system  anytime  they 
believe its use would be appropriate and/or valuable to document an incident. 

(d)  There may be instances in which an officer is required to take immediate action to an event 
that  occurs  directly  in  front  of  them  which  may  not  allow  time  to  activate  their  BWRD.  In 
these circumstances, the officer shall activate their BWDR as soon as practical that allows 
the officer to safely contain the situation. 

303.2.2   WHEN DEPARTMENT ISSUED BWDR SYSTEM DEACTIVATION IS AUTHORIZED 
Once the BWDR system is activated it shall remain on until the incident has concluded. 

(a)  For purposes of this section, conclusion of an incident has occurred when: 

(a)     All arrests have been made and arrestees have been transported; and 

(b)     All witnesses and victims have been interviewed. 

(b)  Recording may cease if no further law enforcement action is likely to occur (e.g., waiting for 

a tow truck or a family member to arrive.) 

303.2.3   WHEN DEPARTMENT ISSUED BWDR SYSTEM USE IS NOT REQUIRED 
Activation of the BWDR system is not required: 

(a)  During break and lunch periods 

(b)  When not in service and not on a call 

(c)  When in service but not on a call. 

303.2.4   BODY WORN DIGITAL RECORDINGS AS EVIDENCE 
Employees will download all recordings of an evidentiary value captured on any BWDR system 
they are carrying by the end of their tour of duty. 

(a)  Employees will also copy the following recordings onto a DVD or CD and submit them as 

evidence as outlined in Policy 618 (Property and Evidence Collection Procedures):

Digital Mobile Audio Video Recording 

304.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The Austin Police Department has equipped designated police units with a Digital Mobile Audio 
Video  Recording  (DMAV)  system.  This  DMAV  system  is  designed  to  assist  and  complement 
employees in the performance of their duties. The DMAV is used to record certain activities by 
providing a visual and/or audio record. Recordings are intended to provide an unbiased record of 
the incident and to supplement the employee's report. 

This policy covers the use of the DMAV system. The VHS MAV system guidelines are outlined in 
Policy 303 (VHS Mobile Audio Video Recording). 

304.2   DIGITAL MOBILE AUDIO VIDEO RECORDER OPERATION 

(a)  The  DMAV  system  is  designed  to  turn  on  automatically  when  any  of  the  following  are 

detected: 

Emergency lights. 

Siren. 

3.  Driver's door opening. 

4.  Crash sensor. 

Speed in excess of 90 MPH. 

Activation of a wireless body microphone.

6. 

1. 

2. 

7.  Manual  activation  by  pressing  the  record  button  on  the  camera,  the  mobile  data 

computer, or the Video Processing Unit. 

(b)     Employees shall turn off the vehicle's AM/FM radio and/or personal mucis devices while the 

DMAV is recording and there is a subject sitting in the backseat of the unit. 

(c)  Employees shall not: 

Bypass or override the automatic activation of the equipment. 

Erase, alter, or delete any recording produced by the DMAV. 

(d)  Absent legal cause or lawful order, no member of the Department may surreptitiously record 
any other member of the Department without the expressed knowledge and consent of all 
parties. 

304.2.1   REQUIRED DMAV TESTING 
Employees  driving  DMAV  equipped  vehicles  during  field  duty  assignments  where  the  required 
use of the DMAV is likely (e.g., patrol, metro-tactical shifts, traffic enforcement) must be trained 
in the operation of the equipment prior to its use.

(a)  All arrests have been made and arrestees have been transported; and 

(b)  All witnesses and victims have been interviewed. 

2.  Recording  may  cease  if  an  employee  is  simply  waiting  for  a  tow  truck  or  a  family 
member  to  arrive,  or  in  other  similar  situations  where  no  further  law  enforcement 
action is likely to occur. 

(b)  Employees may deactivate the audio portion by engaging the mute button on the wireless 

microphone, for administrative reasons only, as follows: 

(a)  The  reason  for  the  audio  deactivation  must  be  recorded  verbally  prior  to  audio 

(b)  After  the  purpose  for  audio  deactivation  has  concluded,  employees  will  reactivate 

deactivation; and 

the audio track. 

(c)  For purposes of this section, an "administrative reason" refers to: 

(a)  Personal conversations unrelated to the incident being recorded. 

(b)  Officer to Officer training (e.g., when a Field Training Officer wishes to speak to a 

Probationary Officer about a training issue). 

(c)  The conclusion of an incident. 

(d)  Any reason authorized by a supervisor. The identity of the supervisor granting the 

authorization shall also be stated prior to the audio deactivation.

Radio and Mobile Data Computer Use 

305.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Digital radio and data communications are extremely vital elements of effective law enforcement. 
These communications will be conducted in a professional, concise, and effective manner. 

Employees are reminded that all digital radio and data transmissions are recorded and subject 
to public information requests. 

305.2   MOBILE DATA COMPUTER USE GUIDELINES 

(a)     The mobile data computer (MDC) shall be used for official police communications only. 

(b)     There is no expectation of privacy concerning sending or receiving messages via the MDC 

system. Messages may be reviewed by supervisors at any time without prior notification. 

(c)  The  MDC  will  remain  docked  and  the  docking  switch  will  be  in  the  locked  position  when 
the  vehicle  is  in motion  or  if  the  MDC  is  left  unattended  unless  otherwise  approved  by  a 
supervisor. 

(d)  Employees will not intentionally disrupt the GPS signal. 

(e)  Employees driving vehicles equipped with an MDC shall: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

Accept all updates to the MDC prior to logging on and while at a hot-spot; however, 
employees reporting to duty from a location that is not a hot-spot shall ensure the 
updates are downloaded as soon as practicable. 

Log on at the start of a shift with complete and accurate information. 

Log off at the end of the shift. 

(f)  Employees granted access to the Watch List should limit the number of additional sectors 
they  are  watching  to  two  (2)  unless  needed  for  an  official  reason  (e.g.,  monitoring  a 
significant event that could impact all sectors). 

(g)  When  an  MDC  is  utilized  in  an  area  where  the  public  might  be  able  to  view  the  screen, 
the  user  will  take  reasonable  measures  to  ensure  any  information  is  not  viewable  by 
unauthorized persons (e.g., lower the screen, lock the computer). 

305.2.1   MDC USE WHILE DRIVING 
Use of the MDC by the operator should be  limited to times when the vehicle is stopped. When 
the  vehicle  is  in  motion,  the  operator  should  only  attempt  to  read  messages  that  are  likely  to 
contain  information  that  is  required  for  immediate  enforcement,  investigative,  or  safety  needs. 
Short transmissions, such as a license plate check, are permitted if it reasonably appears they 
can be done safely.

systems, as well as the established guidelines outlined below: 

1.  Communications involving the protection of life and property shall be afforded priority. 

2. 

3. 

False  calls,  false  or  fraudulent  distress  signals,  unnecessary  and  unidentified 
Communications  and  the  transmission  of  unassigned  call  signals  are  specifically 
prohibited. 

Employees  shall  monitor  the  talk-group  on  which  they  intend  to  transmit  for  a 
sufficient period to ensure their transmissions will not interfere with others. 

4.  Duration  of  radio  transmissions  must  be  restricted  to  the  minimum  practical 

transmission time. 

(b)  Employees   shall   comply   with   the   Greater   Austin/Travis   County,   Texas,   Regional 
Radio  System  (GATRRS),  Interoperability  Plan  when  necessary,  to  communicate  on 
interoperability  channels  that  are  part  of  the  GATRRS  and  is  related  to  the  use  of  radio 
interoperability. 

305.3.2   RADIO TRANSMISSION PROTOCOL 

(a)  Only English shall be spoken. 

(b)  Employees calling or responding to dispatch shall identify themselves by their assigned unit 

number. They should not continue the transmission until acknowledged by the dispatcher. 

(c)  The employee's primary talk-group dispatcher shall be notified before an employee changes 

to another talk-group (e.g., a Central West officer switching to the North West talk-group). 

(d)  Employees shall not call for another employee by name unless their radio or unit number 

is unknown (e.g., "Baker 101 to Sgt. Doe"). 

(e)  Long transmissions should only be done over a secondary talk-group, as an MDC message, 

or via a cell phone if available. 

(f)  Employees  shall  refrain  from  seeking  advice  from  a  dispatcher  regarding  a  point  of  law, 
enforcement  action,  or  Department  policy.  Employees  should  consult  their  immediate 
supervisor on these matters or obtain the information from their laptop computers. 

(g)  Under normal circumstances, employees will not turn off or lower their in-car police radios 
to  a  volume  that  cannot  be  captured  by  the  vehicle's  DMAV  equipment  regardless  if  the 
employee is wearing a ear-bud listening device on their portable radio. An exception would 
be under circumstances when it is deemed necessary to safeguard transmissions from a 
prisoner seated in the patrol car during and incident. 

305.3.3   REQUESTING RECORDED TRANSMISSIONS 
Employees with a legitimate need to hear or copy a radio or telephone recording may do so by 
making a request to the Communication supervisor on duty.

Radio and Mobile Data Computer Use 

305.4   ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES 

305.4.1   DOCUMENTATION OF ACTIVITY 
Radio and MDC transmissions are used to record an employee's daily activity. To ensure the most 
accurate recording of these activities, the following are required: 

(a)     All contacts or activity shall be documented at the time of the contact. 

(b)     Whenever the activity or contact is initiated by voice, it shall be entered into the Computer 

Aided Dispatch (CAD) system by a dispatcher. 

(c)  Whenever  the  activity  or  contact  is  not  initiated  by  voice,  the  employee  shall  record  it  on 

the MDC. 

305.4.2   STATUS CHANGES 

(a)     Employees shall make changes in status (e.g., arrival at scene, meal periods, in-service) 

through the MDC system when safe and practicable. 

1. 

2. 

If MDC use is not safe or practical, employees shall advise the dispatcher of status 
changes using proper radio codes. 

Employees responding to in-progress calls shall advise changes in status over the 
radio to assist other employees responding to the same incident. 

(b)  An employee's status shall be made Code 4 when it is determined that no other units are 
needed.  Any  additional  units  still  responding  to  the  incident  shall  change  their  status  to 
available. 

305.4.3   HIGH PRIORITY INCIDENTS 
Transmissions regarding emergencies (e.g., high-speed pursuits, serious crimes in progress) shall 
be given priority over all other transmissions. Units not involved in the emergency shall stay off 
the air until the situation has been resolved. 

Units coming in-service during an emergency shall change their status on the MDC. If unable to 
do  so,  the  unit  will  switch  to  an  adjoining  sector  talk-group,  advise  that  dispatcher  they  are  in- 
service and then switch back to their primary talk-group. 

305.4.4   EMERGENCY BUTTON ACTIVATION 
If the emergency button is depressed on the MDC or Radio, the dispatcher will call the unit and 
ask if the unit is Code 4. 

(a) 

(b) 

If there is no emergency the employee should respond "Code 4" and all units shall resume 
their normal activity. 

If there  is no  response or  the employee  answers  in  some  other  way, the  dispatcher shall 
send available units to assist in locating the unit that is transmitting the emergency. Available 
units may self assign the call via the MDC and respond as appropriate.

2.  When  the  situation  is  considered  Code  4,  all  units  not  on-scene  shall  go  back  in 

service. 

305.4.5   BOMB THREATS 
Bombs and other explosive devices can be detonated by radio waves (e.g., mobile phones, radio, 
MDC) transmitted in close proximity to the device. 

(a)  When responding to bomb threats, employees should be conscious of the location of any 
suspected devices (e.g., parking lot, inside a building, open field) and park their patrol unit 
accordingly. 

(b)     When  investigating  reports  of  a  bomb  threat,  employees  shall  follow  Policy  414  (Bomb 

Threat and Explosive Device Response). 

305.4.6   CLOSING THE CHANNEL 
Closing a radio channel ("holding the air") is done for the safety of officers involved in a call or 
event  that  requires  the  radio  remain  silent.  Events  that  require  a  channel  be  closed  will  follow 
these guidelines: 

(a)  Any  supervisor  (including  a  dispatch  supervisor)  may  close  a  channel  to  ensure  officer 
safety. If the dispatcher does not apply the channel marker, units involved in the event may 
request that it be applied. 

(b)  The dispatcher will broadcast the channel is closed and should enable the channel marker 
on that channel so that a low audible "beep" will occur every 8-10 seconds. The "beep" is a

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Search and Seizure 

306.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Both  the  federal  and  state  Constitutions  provide  every  individual  with  the  right  to  be  free  from 
unreasonable  searches  and  seizures.  This  policy  provides  general  guidelines  for  Austin  Police 
Department personnel to consider when dealing with search and seizure issues. 

306.2   SEARCH AND SEIZURE 
This policy outlines the following types of searches and seizures: 

(a)  Exigent circumstances. 

(b)     Consent. 

(c)  Search incident to a lawful arrest. 

(d)  Vehicle inventory. 

(e)     Probable cause. 

(f)  Protective frisk based on reasonable suspicion. 

(g)  Plain view. 

(h)     Strip/Body cavity search. 

(i)      Residences, open fields, and abandoned property. 

306.2.1   SEARCH PROTOCOL 

(a)     Officers will conduct person searches with dignity and courtesy. 

(b)  Officers will conduct property searches in a manner that returns the condition of the property 

to its pre-search status as nearly as reasonably practicable. 

(c)  Officers should attempt to acquire keys to locked property when a search is anticipated and 

the time and effort required to gain the keys makes it a practicable option. 

(d) 

It  is  the  responsibility  of  each  individual  officer  to  search  a  prisoner  for  weapons  or 
contraband anytime he gains custody of that prisoner, regardless of whether the prisoner 
was previously searched by another officer. 

(e)     When safety permits: 

1.  Officers should explain to the person being searched the reason for the search and 

how the search will be conducted. 

2.  Officers needing to search a person of the opposite gender should do so in front of 
a Mobile Audio Video (MAV) recording system, if available; otherwise an officer of 
the same gender as the person should be requested.

Search and Seizure 

(a) 

If  a  Mobile  Audio  Video  (MAV)  recording  system  or  an  officer  of  the  same 
gender  as  the  person  being  searched  is  unavailable,  a  second  officer  or 
supervisor should be present. 

(b)  Officers  will  use  the  back  side  of  their  hands  and  fingers  to  frisk/search 
sensitive  areas  of  the  opposite  gender  to  include  the  breast,  crotch,  and 
buttocks. 

306.3   EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES 
Exigent circumstances permitting entry into premises without a warrant or valid consent generally 
include any of the following: 

(a)  The reasonable belief that a person within is in need of immediate aid. 

(b)  The need to protect or preserve life or avoid injury. 

(c) 

Imminent escape of a suspect. 

(d)  The reasonable belief that contraband is about to be removed or destroyed. 

An  exigency  created  by  the  officer's  own  conduct  as  an  excuse  for  a  warrantless  entry  is  not 
permitted. 

(e)  Public safety. 

306.4   CONSENT 

(a)  Entry  into  a  location  or  vehicle  for  the  purpose  of  conducting  a  search  for  any  item 
reasonably believed relevant to any investigation is permitted once valid consent has been 
obtained.Officers should be aware that overuse of the consent search can negatively impact 
the Department's relationship with our community and only request a consent search when 
they  have  an  articulable  reason  why  they  believe  the  search  is  necessary  and  likely  to 
produce  evidence  related  to  an  investigation.  A  search  by  consent  is  only  allowed  if  the 
following criteria are met: 

1. 

The  officer  has  explained  the  reason  for  the  consent  search  request  to  their 
supervisor (or their Corporal/Detective if their supervisor is unavailable) and received 
their approval prior to requesting consent. If the officer is: 

(a)  Assigned to a specialized unit that has received specific training on consent 

searches; or 

(b)  The officer has completed the department's Interdiction for the Protection of 
Children (IPC) training and is actively conducting an IPC investigation; then 
the officer would not need supervisor approval prior to requesting consent. 

2.  Consent is voluntary (e.g., clear, specific and unequivocal).

3.  Consent is obtained from a person who has the authority to give the consent (e.g., 

care, custody and control of the location or vehicle). 

4. 

The search does not exceed the scope of the consent given. 

(b)  Consent  must  be  obtained  as  the  product  of  a  free  will.  It  cannot  be  obtained  through 

submission to authority, either expressed or implied. 

(c)  Although  officers  are  not  required  to  conduct  searches  within  the  plain  view  of  suspects, 
those  who  have  the  authority  to  grant  or  revoke  consent  should  be  in  a  position  to 
communicate  a  withdrawal  of  consent  should they  so  desire.  If  consent  was  obtained  by 
telephone  from  a  person  who  has  authority  to  grant  the  consent,  the  person  should  be 
provided with contact information to revoke the consent. 

(d)  Absent other legal justification, any related search should be discontinued at any point that 
consent is withdrawn, even if the withdrawal is made by a different party who is at the scene 
and who also has authority over the area being searched. 

306.4.1   HOW TO DOCUMENT CONSENT 

(a)  Consent requests and authorization for all vehicle and subject stops shall be documented on 
the Department approved Consent to Search Form (PD0100) and should also be recorded 
by audio and/or video when possible. Searches conducted during an active IPC investigation 
will be handled under Subsection (b). 

1. 

After the subject consents to the search by signing the Consent to Search Form, the 
officer can proceed with the search. 

(a) 

(b) 

If at anytime after the search has begun the person revokes their consent, the 
officer will immediately stop and search no further unless sufficient probable 
cause has already been developed to warrant continuing with the search. 

If consent is revoked, the officer will mark the "Search Suspended" box on 
the Consent to Search Form. 

2.  Officers unable to document a subject's voluntary consent to search by audio and 
video recording will document in the CAD history why they were unable to document 
the consent on audio and video. 

(b)  Consent requests and authorization for active IPC investigations shall be documented by 
audio  and/or  video  recording.   However,  for  tracking  purposes  the  Department  approved 
Consent to  Search  Form (PD100)  shall  be  completed  at the  conclusion  of the stop.   The 
subject’s signature is not required. 

(c)  For  consent  searches  not  involving  a  vehicle  or  subject  stop,  an  officer  with  supervisory 
approval may document the voluntary consent using only video and/or audio recording 

(d)  Employees will document in their report or supplement anytime a consent search is used.

(a)  Whe 
n consent to search is documented by a Mobile Audio Video (MAV) recording system: 
 
 

The MAV media will be submitted to the evidence room for retention; or 

The digital recording will be uploaded to the appropriate APD computer/server for 
storage. 

3.  When an incident report is written, employees will document where the recording is 

stored. 

 
(b)  Consent to Search Forms will be handled as follows: 

If  contraband  is  discovered  during  the  search,  officers  will  submit  the  completed 
and signed Consent to Search Form, to the evidence room to maintain the chain of 
custody.  A copy  of the form  will  be  submitted to  their  supervisor  at the end of the 
shift to be routed through the chain-of-command. 

If  no  contraband  is  discovered  during  the  search,  officers  will  submit  the  original 
signed Consent to Search Form, to their supervisor at the end of the shift to be routed 
through the chain-of-command. 

(c)  Whe 
metr 

n consent search is used by detectives or officers assigned to Specialized Units (e.g., 
o tactical): 

Employees will maintain the original Consent to Search Form and MAV recording 
in their case jacket. 

A copy of the Consent to Search Form will be submitted to their supervisor at the 
end of the shift to be routed through the chain-of-command. 

306.4.3   CHAIN-OF-COMMAND REVIEW OF CONSENT FORMS 
Consent to Search Forms will be forwarded up the chain-of-command. 

(a)  Each level in the chain will review and initial the Consent to Search Form. 

(b)  After the review is completed, the form will be given to a designated administrative person 

for scanning into the Departmental records system under the appropriate report number. 

(c)  After the form is scanned, the original form will be routed to Central Records for retention 

unless it has been stored in the evidence room or a case jacket. 

306.5   SEARCH INCIDENT TO ARREST 
The general authority to search incident to a lawful custodial arrest is not qualified or limited by 
the type of arrest. Objects of the search are weapons, evidence, and/or means of escape. 

(a)  Persons: 

1.  When  officers  make  a 

they  are  permitted  to  conduct  a 
contemporaneous search of the arrestee. Such a search safeguards the arresting

officer and others nearby from harm while ensuring that the arrestee will not discard 
or destroy evidence. 

It is entirely reasonable for arresting officers to search the area where the defendant 
might reach in order to grab a weapon or evidence. 

A  search  of  a  vehicle  interior  may  be  made  when  the  arrestee  is  unsecured  and 
within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search. 

A search of a vehicle interior may be made when it is reasonable to believe that the 
vehicle contains evidence of the offense of arrest. 

If officers do not have a valid reason to search a vehicle after making an arrest (e.g. 
probable cause, inventory), a search warrant will need to be obtained. 

4.  Officers  may  examine  the  contents  of  any  opened  or  closed  container  within  the 
passenger  compartment,  provided  the  container  is  within  reaching  distance  of  the 
arrestee and the arrestee is unsecured at the time of the search. 

5. 

Locked containers found within the vehicle passenger compartment may be seized 
and a search warrant obtained in a timely manner. 

306.6   VEHICLE INVENTORY 
An  inventory  is  a  legitimate  law  enforcement  activity  that  is  not  a  search  and  that  sometimes, 
incidentally,  results  in  the  discovery  of  evidence.  Vehicle  inventories  will  be  conducted  in 
accordance with Policy 350 (Vehicle Towing and Impound). 

306.7   PROBABLE CAUSE 

(a)     Person: 

(b)     Vehicles: 

1.  When officers have probable cause to believe that evidence or contraband is located 

on a person they are permitted to conduct a search of the person. 

1.  Officers  may  conduct  a  warrantless  search  of  a  readily  movable  vehicle  (e.g., 
automobile, mobile home, boat or airplane) if there is probable cause to believe that 
evidence or contraband is inside and the search cannot safely be delayed in order 
to obtain a warrant. 

(a)  Officers must have probable cause that contraband is in the vehicle. 

(b)  A search of an automobile based on probable cause lawfully extends to all 
parts  of  the  vehicle  in  which  evidence  or  contraband  could  be  concealed, 
including closed compartments and trunks.

Search and Seizure 

(c) 

Locked  containers  found  within  the  vehicle  may  be  seized  and  a  search 
warrant obtained in a timely manner. 

(d)  The  scope  of  a  warrantless  search  of  a  lawfully  stopped  vehicle  based  on 
probable cause  is  no  narrower  and  no  broader than the  scope  of a  search 
under the authority of a warrant. 

306.8   FRISK (PAT-DOWN) FOR WEAPONS 
A frisk is a mere pat-down of the outer clothing, area, vehicle or container to which a detained 
person may have immediate access. The purpose of a limited weapons frisk after an investigatory 
stop  is  not to  discover  crime,  but to  allow  the  officer to pursue  the  investigation  without fear  of 
violence. An officer does not need to be absolutely certain that an individual is armed; the issue is 
whether a reasonably prudent person would justifiably believe that he or others were in danger. 

A frisk is a limited patting of the outer surfaces of a person's clothing in an attempt to 
find weapons. A frisk can only be used by officers when they justifiably stop someone 
and  have  a  reasonable  fear  for  their  safety,  the  safety  of  the  public,  or  when  a 
cautious and prudent officer under the same or similar circumstances would conduct 
a pat-down. 

2.  Normally, officers cannot put their hands under the suspect's outer clothing until they 
feel something they reasonably believe is a weapon. If the outer clothing is too bulky 
to allow officers to decide if a weapon is concealed underneath, outer clothing such 
as overcoats and jackets may be opened to allow a pat down of the inner clothing, 
such as shirts and trousers. 

Packages, purses, briefcases and other containers may be frisked during the stop. 

The scope of a protective frisk is limited to persons and places within arm's reach of 
a concealed weapon or toward which the subject might lunge. 

(a)     Persons: 

1. 

3. 

4. 

1. 

(b)     Vehicles: 

A protective frisk may include the passenger compartment of an automobile, limited 
to those areas in which a weapon may be placed or hidden, if the officer possesses 
reasonable belief that the suspect is dangerous and may gain control of a weapon 
at any time during the encounter. 

306.9   PLAIN VIEW 
Because an individual does not have an expectation of privacy as to items that are in plain view, 
no  search  has  taken  place  in  a  constitutional  sense  when  an  object  is  viewed  from  a  location 
where the officer has a right to be. 

(a)     An item in plain view may generally be seized when all of the following conditions exist:

object is plainly seen; and 

viewing the object; and 

4. 

The object's incriminating character must be so immediately and sufficiently apparent 
that  officers  have  probable  cause  to  believe  the  object  is  contraband  or  evidence 
of a crime. 

306.10   STRIP/BODY CAVITY SEARCHES 
Strip and body cavity searches are sometimes necessary for the safety of persons and/or to secure 
evidence of criminal activity. However, such searches are highly intrusive and must be conducted 
only when the justification can be clearly articulated, and then done only with proper regard for 
human dignity and privacy. 

(a)  All  cases  of  strip  or  body  cavity  searches  will  be  documented  in  an  incident  report  or 

supplement and include (at a minimum): 

1. 

Facts known to the officer that justify a strip/body cavity search; and 

2.  Name and employee number of supervisor authorizing the search; and 

3. 

Place  that  the  search  was  conducted  (e.g.,  bathroom  of  suspect's  residence,  jail, 
doctor's office); and 

4.  Name and employee number of all persons involved in the search; and 

5. 

The areas searched and results of the search. 

306.10.1   STRIP SEARCHES 
Strip searches: 

(a)     Will be conducted only with the approval of a supervisor. 

(b)  Will be conducted in privacy, including only the number of officers necessary to maintain 

a safe situation. 

(c)     Will be conducted ONLY by members of the same gender as the person to be searched. 
Should an officer of the same gender not be immediately available, the prisoner will either 
be secured until one can arrive, or the prisoner will be secured and transported to the jail 
where a jailer of the same gender will conduct the search. 

306.10.2   BODY CAVITY SEARCHES 
Other than for checking the mouth area, these searches will not be conducted by officers of this 
department. Should the need arise for this type of search, the prisoner will be transported to the 
jail where proper hygienic/medical resources are available.

306.11   RESIDENCES, OPEN FIELDS, AND ABANDONED PROPERTY 

306.11.1   RESIDENCES 
Every person has a reasonable expectation of privacy inside his home and a search of a residence 
will  not  be  conducted  without  a  valid  search  warrant,  exigent  circumstances,  or  valid  consent. 
Individuals do not, however, generally have a reasonable expectation of privacy in areas around 
the  home  where  the  general  public  (e.g.,  mail  carriers  and  solicitors)  would  reasonably  be 
permitted to go. 

Once  lawfully  inside  a  residence,  officers  may  conduct  a  protective  frisk  of  a  subject  if  the 
officer has a reasonable belief that the person is armed and dangerous. In addition, the Fourth 
Amendment  permits  a  limited  protective  sweep  of  a  residence  when  the  searching  officer 
possesses a reasonable belief that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger 
to those on scene. The sweep should not last longer than is necessary to dispel the reasonable 
suspicion of danger. 

306.11.2   OPEN FIELDS 
Open  fields  do  not  provide  the  privacy  expectation  that  is  unique  to  the  Fourth  Amendment's 
safeguards of a "person's, houses, papers and effects." Officers must be mindful of the requisites 
of curtilage. The following are the factors the officers need to assess: 

(a)     The proximity of the area to the home. 

(b)  Whether the area is included within an enclosure surrounding the home. 

(c)  The nature of the uses to which the area is put. 

(d)     Steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by people passing by. 

306.11.3   ABANDONED PROPERTY 
Abandonment occurs when a person discards or denies ownership of property in a public right 
of  way  or  public  spaces.  To  ensure  admissibility  of  evidence,  the  following  factors  should  be 
considered: 

(a)  When  making  a  trash  run  officers  need  to  consider  curtilage  factors  that  fall  within  open 

fields. 

(b)  Officers need to have an affirmative link to create probable cause between the discarded 

property and the target of the investigation. 

(c)     The abandonment must be voluntary and not a result of police misconduct.

308.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Tex.  Code  of  Crim.  Pro.  art.  14.06  permits  law  enforcement  agencies  to  use  citation  release 
procedures in lieu of arrest for Class A, B, and C misdemeanor offenses with certain exceptions. 

This policy does not apply to juveniles or traffic citations. Officers shall refer to the following policies 
regarding these topics: 

(a)  Policy 317 (Juveniles). 

(b)  Policy 342 (Traffic Citations). 

308.2   STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS 
A citation, or field release, is when the violator is released in the field without being transported 
to a jail facility. 

308.3   MISDEMEANOR CITATION CONSIDERATIONS 

(a)  The following shall be considered when making the determination to issue a misdemeanor 

citation: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

The subject has sufficient identification; and 

The officer has no substantial reason to believe the subject will fail to appear; and 

The officer has reason to believe that release by citation will result in termination of 
the violation; and 

The  subject  did  not resist  detention,  assault  anyone  during the  offense, or  appear 
to be combative or violent. 

(b)  For a misdemeanor offense that can be enhanced due to prior convictions, a criminal history 

check should be performed to determine if a custody arrest is more appropriate. 

308.3.1   MISDEMEANOR CITATION USE 
Officers  are  authorized  to  use  verbal  or  written  warnings  to  resolve  minor  violations  when 
appropriate. 

(a)  Class A and Class B Misdemeanor Citations 

1.  On-duty officers who make the decision to take enforcement action on a subject who 
violates a Class A or Class B offense eligible for a misdemeanor citation shall issue 
a citation when all considerations outlined in this policy have been met. 

2. 

Supervisor  approval  is  required  to  make  a  custody  arrest  in  lieu  of  a  citation  for 
eligible Class A or Class B offenses that meet all the considerations outlined in this 
policy.

Misdemeanor Citations 

(b)  Class C Misdemeanor Citations 

1.  Officers  enforcing  a  Class  C  misdemeanor,  other  than  traffic,  should  use  the 
considerations outlined in this policy for the issuance of a citation. Officers shall select 
the least intrusive or severe method, which will: 

(a)  Stop existing criminal conduct. 

(b)  Remove the imminent threat of violence or criminal conduct. 

(c)  Prevent persons from endangering themselves or others. 

308.3.2   DISQUALIFYING CIRCUMSTANCES 
A citation shall not be issued if the following situations are present: 

(a)  The subject is so intoxicated that he could be a danger to himself or to others. Release may 

occur as soon as this condition no longer exists. 

(b)  The  subject  requires  medical  examination  or  medical  care  or  is  otherwise  unable  to  care 

for his own safety. 

1. 

An arrestee shall not be released from custody for the sole purpose of allowing that 
subject to obtain medical care and with the intention of immediately re-arresting the 
same individual upon discharge from the hospital unless it can be determined that 
the hospital can bill and collect from a third-party payment source. 

(c)  There are one or more outstanding arrest warrants for the subject. 

(d)  The subject could not provide satisfactory evidence of personal identification. 

(e)  A full custody arrest is called for, or the officer has reason to suspect the subject is involved 
in a more serious offense and a custody arrest would serve to gather evidence to support 
another charge. 

(f) 

There is a reasonable likelihood that the offense(s) would continue or resume, or that the 
safety of persons or property would be imminently endangered by the release of the subject 
arrested. 

(g)  The subject arrested demands to be taken before a magistrate or has refused to sign the 

citation. 

(h)  There is reason to believe the subject would not appear at the time and place specified in 

the citation. The basis for this determination shall be specifically stated. 

(i) 

The  offense  is  DOC  12  (Exposure)  and  the  exposure  appears  to  have  been  committed 
deliberately, maliciously, or with sexual motivation. 

308.3.3   SUPERVISORY ORDERS

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Handling Juveniles 

317.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The  purpose  of  this  policy  is  to  provide  guidance  and  direction  for  processing  and  handling 
juvenile offenders within APD's jurisdiction. Juveniles are afforded equal protection under the law; 
however, there are differences in the manner in which juveniles are handled under Texas law. 

Employees are responsible for participating with and supporting the ideals set forth in Title 3 of 
the Texas Family Code. These provisions are: 

(a)  To provide for the protection of the public, and public safety. 

(b)  Consistent with the protection of the public and public safety: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

To promote the concept of punishment for criminal acts; and 

To remove, when appropriate, the taint of criminality from children committing certain 
unlawful acts; and 

To provide treatment, training, and rehabilitation that emphasizes the accountability 
and responsibility of both the parent and the child for the child's conduct. 

(c)  To  provide  for  the  care,  the  protection,  and  the  wholesome  moral,  mental,  and  physical 

development of children coming within its provisions. 

(d)  To achieve these purposes in a family environment whenever possible, separating the child 
from the child's parent only when necessary for the child's welfare or in the interest of public 
safety and, when the child is removed from the child's family, to give the child the care that 
should be provided by parents. 

(e)  To provide a simple judicial procedure through which the provisions of this title are executed 
and enforced and in which the parties are assured a fair hearing and their constitutional and 
other legal rights recognized and enforced. 

317.1.1   DEFINITIONS 
Child/Juvenile: a person who is (Tex. Fam. Code § 51.02(2)): 

(a)  10 years of age or older and under 17 years of age, or 

(b)  17  years  of  age  or  older  and  under  18  years  of  age  who  is  alleged  or  found  to  have 
engaged in delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision as a result of 
acts committed before becoming 17 years of age. 

• 

The ages of children who come within various classifications of offenses may vary in each 
instance. Note carefully the age limitations in each situation as set forth by law. 

Conduct  Indicating  a  Need  For  Supervision:  Conduct,  other  than  a  traffic  offense,  that  is 
punishable by a fine only or would not be a criminal offense if committed by an adult (e.g., runaway, 
curfew violation). (Tex. Fam. Code § 51.03 (b))

Handling Juveniles 

Custody: A child is considered "in custody" when they would be considered "under arrest" if the 
child was an adult. 

Delinquent  Conduct:  Conduct,  other  than  a  traffic  offense,  that  if  committed  by  an  adult  is 
punishable by imprisonment or confinement in jail. (Tex. Fam. Code § 51.03 (a)) 

Detention:  A  detention  situation  exists  when  an  officer  detains  a  child  for  a  short  period  for 
investigative purposes. 

Status Offender: Generally, a child who is accused, adjudicated, or convicted for conduct that 
would not, under state law, be a crime if committed by an adult. (Tex. Fam. Code § 51.02(15)) 

317.1.2   CONFIDENTIALITY 
The confidentiality of names of juveniles and their records is mandated by state law. The following 
guidelines will be strictly followed: 

(a)  The names of juvenile offenders will not be released to the news media or any other person 

not involved in the judicial or diversion process. 

(b)  A  juvenile  defendant  or  juvenile  suspect  shall  not  be  named  in  any  public  document, 
including an affidavit for an arrest warrant involving an adult co-defendant or in an affidavit for 
a search warrant. However, there may be times when an investigator believes that naming a 
juvenile in the affidavit is essential. In those cases, an assistant district attorney assigned to 
juvenile court should be contacted in order that alternatives (other than naming the juvenile) 
can be explored. 

(c) 

Information  on  juveniles  collected  during  the  course  of  business  may  be  released/ 
disseminated under the following circumstances:

to other criminal justice agencies or any court having jurisdiction over a child; 

Information concerning missing children may be entered into NCIC; and 

Information  concerning  children  adjudicated  of  sexual  offenses  and  required  to 
register with the Department as sex offenders will be forwarded to DPS. 

(d)  Physical files and records concerning juveniles shall not be open to public inspection, and 
shall be open to inspection only by a juvenile justice agency or criminal justice agency. 

(e) 

If  an  investigator  believes  obtaining  a  warrant  for  the  arrest  of  a  juvenile  offender  is 
necessary the investigator will present the probable cause affidavit and arrest warrant to a 
magistrate for approval and signature. 

1. 

The municipal court clerk currently issues the warrant a "J" number but will not retain 
the affidavit or warrant on file.

317.2   CUSTODY OF JUVENILES 

317.2.1   TAKING A JUVENILE INTO CUSTODY 

(a)  Section 52.01 of the Texas Family Code states that a child may be taken into custody: 

Pursuant to an order of the Juvenile Court. 

Pursuant to the laws of arrest. 

1. 

2. 

3. 

By a law enforcement officer, if there is probable cause to believe that the child was 
engaged in: 

(a)  Conduct that violates a penal law of this state or a penal ordinance of any 

political subdivision of this state; or 

(b)  Delinquent conduct or conduct indicating a need for supervision. 

4. 

By a probation officer if there is probable cause to believe that the child has violated 
a condition of probation imposed by the juvenile court. 

5. 

Pursuant to a directive to apprehend. 

(b) 

In place of taking a child into custody, state law allows a peace officer to issue a field release 
citation for  a  traffic  offense  or  an  offense,  other  than  public  intoxication  or  possession  of 
marijuana, punishable by fine only. 

(c)  State law does not require that a warrant be issued to take a child into custody for a past 
offense, as long as there is probable cause to believe that the child committed the offense. 
In making warrantless arrests, patrol officers will follow the direction of an investigative unit 
and/or their supervisor. 

(d)  Officers  will  apply  the  same  probable  cause  standard  for  juveniles  as  that  used  for  adult 

offenders.

Handling Juveniles 

(e)  Officers  are  encouraged  to  contact  their  Sector  Detective  Unit  for  advice  regarding  the 
probable cause for arrest, the type of charge, disposition of the juvenile, or to provide any 
other assistance needed. 

317.2.2   EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT 
Children taken into custody that are believed to suffer from a serious physical condition or illness 
and requires prompt treatment should be seen by EMS and/or transported to a medical facility. 

317.2.3   REQUIRED PARENT NOTIFICATION 
In  contrast  to  detention  situations,  the  law  requires  that  a  child's  parent/guardian  be  promptly 
notified when the child is in police custody. 

(a) 

(b) 

If a child is taken to a Juvenile Detention Facility, intake personnel will typically make the 
parent notification. However, at times, they may need assistance from APD when a parent/ 
guardian  cannot  be  contacted  by  phone. In  that case,  intake  personnel may  request that 
APD attempt to contact the parents in person by calling Communications. 

In  the  event  that  a  child  taken  into  custody  is  brought  directly  to  an  APD  facility  to  be 
interviewed, it is the responsibility of the arresting officer to make parent/guardian notification 
or coordinate that notification with the appropriate investigator. 

(c)  Officers  shall    indicate    on  the  juvenile  facility  booking  form  and  in  an  incident  report 

information regarding contact with the juvenile's parent/guardian. 

317.2.4   SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS 
Juveniles shall not be transported in the same vehicle with adults who are suspected of or charged 
with  criminal  acts.  Juveniles  shall  be  separated  at  any  and  all  times  by  sight  and  sound  from 
adults detained in the same building. Separation requires that  adults and juveniles in detention 
are unable to see each other or to converse (Tex. Fam. Code § 51.12). 

317.2.5   RELEASING A JUVENILE FROM CUSTODY 

(a)  When releasing a juvenile from custody, officers should take reasonable steps to release 

him to his custodial parent or guardian. 

(b) 

If a custodial parent or guardian is not available and officers need to release the juvenile to 
someone else, the following guidelines shall be followed: 

1.  Run  a  check for  any  protective  order regarding  the  adult  with  whom  placement of 

the juvenile is being considered. 

2.  Complete  warrant  and  criminal  history  checks  to  ensure  the  juvenile  is  not  being 

placed with a wanted or dangerous felon.

(b)  Reporting 

(c)  Runaways: When an officer establishes that a juvenile is a runaway, every attempt should 
be  made to  transport  the  runaway  home for release to a  custodial  parent  or guardian,  or 
have the custodial parent or guardian meet the officer at the scene for release. If the officer 
is not able to contact a custodial parent or guardian, the officer shall follow the guidelines 
for "Releasing A Juvenile From Custody" as outlined in this policy. If a juvenile cannot be 
released to an appropriate adult, the following guidelines shall be followed: 

(a)  Transporting 

If  the  initial  runaway  report  was  generated  by  any  agency  within  Travis 
County, the juvenile shall be taken to Life Works. Any forms required by the 
facility shall be completed. 

If the runaway report was generated by an agency outside of Travis County, 
the  juvenile  shall  be  taken  to  Gardner-Betts.  A  booking  sheet  shall  be 
completed. 

If  the  original  report  was generated  by  APD,  a  supplement shall  be  written 
to the original report. 

If the original report was generated by any agency other than APD, an incident 
report shall be initiated and titled "Recovered Runaway." 

(d)  Possible  Custody  Situations:  The  following  situations  are  typically  considered  conduct 
indicating a need for supervision though sometimes circumstances dictate that transport to 
a detention facility may be required. If a juvenile is transported to a detention facility for any 
of the following offenses, the officer is required to complete a booking sheet. 

1.  Driving Under Influence (DUI): Officers shall adhere to the guidelines outlined in 
Policy 355 (DWI Enforcement) for how to handle Juvenile DUI/DWI arrests. 

2. 

Family  Violence  Assault  By  Contact/Threat: If necessary to preserve the peace 
and eliminate the possibility of further violence, a juvenile may be taken into custody 
and transported to the appropriate juvenile detention facility if they are involved in 
a  family  violence  situation  and  commit  a  Class  C  misdemeanor  offense  such  as 
"assault by contact" or "assault by threat" in the presence or view of a peace officer. 

317.3.2   DELINQUENT CONDUCT 

(a) 

Juveniles taken into custody for delinquent conduct (Class B misdemeanors or above) shall

(a) 

If a juvenile is  being   combative   and   it is unsafe  to bring them to the 
APD ID Section, officers may request an APD ID Technician to meet them at 
Gardner-Betts to process the juvenile there. 

2.  Williamson  County:  The  juvenile  shall  be  transported  to  the  Williamson  County 
Juvenile Justice Center for processing and booking. Any accompanying paperwork 
(e.g., booking sheet, receipts, pictures) shall be forwarded to the appropriate Area 
Command Investigative Unit for disposition. 

3.  Hays  County:  Upon  taking  a  juvenile  into  custody  in  Hays  County,  officers  shall 
call  the  24  hour  intake  number  for  the  Hays  County  Juvenile  Detention  Center  at 
(512)393-5220,  ext  11201  for  approval  prior  to  transport.  If  the  officer  is  denied

shall  be transported  to the  APD ID  Section for  processing, followed  by  booking at 
the Hays County Juvenile Detention Center. Any accompanying paperwork shall be 
turned in to the Hays County Juvenile Detention Center intake officer. 

(b) 

In certain instances, processing of a Juvenile is not required. Juveniles may be transported 
directly to the appropriate Juvenile Detention Facility and booked when: 

(a)  Any  warrant  or  directive  to  apprehend  issued  by  TYC  or  Juvenile  Court  (e.g., 

probation violation warrants, escape from TYC warrants). 

(b)  Any warrant or directive to apprehend a child where the child was already processed 

for the original charge. 

(c)  Any offense that occurred prior to Jan. 1, 1996. 

(c)     If a juvenile is taken into custody for DWI, the juvenile shall be transported directly to an

Class C charges shall NOT be placed on the booking sheet. 

(e)  A  juvenile  taken  into  custody  for  delinquent  conduct  shall  not  be  released  to  a  parent/ 
guardian  until  the  child  has  been  processed  and  booked  at  the  appropriate  Juvenile 
Detention Facility.

317.5   JUVENILE INTERVIEWS, INTERROGATIONS AND STATEMENTS 

(a)  The following types of statements made by juvenile suspects are admissible as evidence 

317.5.1   TYPES OF STATEMENTS 

under the Family Code: 

were made by an adult. 

1.  Res  Gestae  -  spontaneous  statements  made  by  children  may  be  used  as  if  they 

2. 

Statements leading to the discovery of evidence - defined as oral statements of 
fact or circumstances that are true, which tend to establish the child's guilt, such as 
finding secreted or stolen property or the instrument with which the child states the 
offense was committed. 

3.  Custodial Statements - An oral or written statement by a child in custody, detention 
or confinement is admissible if, before giving the statement, the child has been given 
the Miranda warning by a magistrate. This warning must be given out of the presence 
of police officers or prosecutors. An exception would be under circumstances when 
it is deemed necessary to have an officer present for the magistrate's protection. 

(a)  Oral Statements: The statement must be recorded by an electronic recording 
device  (tape  recorder  or  video  camera)  and,  before  making  the  statement, 
the child receives the Miranda warning by a magistrate as described above 
and the warning is made part of the recording. 

(b)  Written  Statements:  The  written  statement  must  be  reviewed  with  the 
juvenile,  and  signed,  in  front  of  the  magistrate  and  out  of  the  presence 
of  police  officers  or  prosecutors  unless  necessary  for  the  magistrate's 
protection. 

(b)  The Family Code does not preclude the admissibility of other types of statements, including 
those that "do not stem from custodial interrogation." The admissibility of such statements

will depend upon the circumstances surrounding the taking of the statement and the facts 
of the case. 

317.5.2   WORKING WITH PARENTS 
A child's parent or guardian has personal legal responsibility for the child's welfare and behavior. 
The Department recognizes this responsibility and police officers will work with parents as closely 
as possible in interviewing children. Examples of procedures that help parents are: 

(a)     Explaining a child's illegal or suspicious behavior as soon as possible. 

(b)  Responding  with  patience  and  understanding  to  questions  that  are  defensive  or  reflect  a 

parent's fears about police procedures and the court system. 

(c)  When  reasonable,  giving  parents  advance  notice  that  their  child  will  be  interviewed  or 

interrogated. 

317.5.3   GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR INTERVIEWING JUVENILES 

(a)  The Department encourages officers to adjust their interviewing style to be sensitive to each 
person's  age  and  experience,  remaining  consistent  with the  Department's  commitment  to 
treat all people with respect. The more approaches an officer can use, the more cooperation 
they can achieve with each child. 

(b) 

Interviews:  An  interview  takes  place  when  a  juvenile  witness  or  victim  of  a  crime  is 
questioned.  It  is  not  necessary  to  administer  rights  or  to  have  the  parents  or  guardians 
present. If a child implicates themselves during the interview, the interview shall be stopped 
and the procedures for interrogation followed. 

(c)     Age Considerations: 

1. 

2. 

If the child is too young or mentally incompetent to render a decision, the parents or 
guardians should be present. 

Interviewing  children  under  the  age  of  13  should  be  done  at  the  Center  for  Child 
Protection, especially when the child is the victim of a violent offense. 

317.5.4   GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR INTERROGATING JUVENILES 

(a) 

Interrogations: An interrogation is the questioning of a juvenile who is suspected of a status 
or criminal offense. 

1.  On-scene  Interrogation:  Street  interrogations  should  be  avoided  until  after  the 
juvenile  can  be  processed  unless  it  is  absolutely  necessary  for  the  preliminary 
investigation.  However,  street  interviews  often  present  exigent  circumstances  that 
demand  immediate  action  from  the  responding  officer.  Suspects,  weapons  and 
evidence may be lost if information is not immediately obtained. Officer safety, safety 
of the public, and the need to obtain basic information are considerations that patrol 
officers must deal with in making decisions regarding the street interrogation of a

juvenile.  The  general  rules  of  interrogation  and  admissibility  of  evidence  apply  to 
juveniles, with additional requirements existing for custodial interrogations. 

2.  Non-Custodial Interrogations: 

(a) 

Juveniles are not in custody when they are voluntarily brought in by a parent 
or guardian. Therefore, no magistrates' warning is required prior to taking a 
confession under these circumstances. 

(b)  Officers  should  be  aware  of  any factor  that  might  negate the non-custodial 
status  of  the  interrogation  and  affect  the  admissibility  of  the  statements 
obtained. For example, giving a child a ride to the station, even if the child 
accompanied  the  officer  voluntarily  and  with  the  consent  of  their  parents, 
could be interpreted by the courts as an indication that the juvenile was "in 
custody." 

(c) 

Juveniles  who  have  given  voluntary  non-custodial  confessions  will  not  be 
immediately taken into custody. They will be released to a parent/guardian. If 
probable cause for arrest is developed through the confession or otherwise, a 
juvenile warrant may be obtained. Failure to follow this procedure could taint 
the voluntariness of the confession. 

3.  Custodial Interrogations: The Miranda warning administered by a magistrate must 
precede  all  custodial  confessions.  Prior  to  conducting  a  custodial  interrogation  of 
a  juveniles,  employees  will  confer  with  the  juvenile  and  parents  or  guardians  to 
explain agency and juvenile justice system procedures. The custodial interrogation 
of a juvenile may take place in two types of situations; the exact procedures to be 
followed vary depending on the situation. 

(a)  At  a  Juvenile  Processing  Office: The interrogation of a juvenile may take 
place  at  a  juvenile  processing  office  if  the  juvenile  is  transported  there 
immediately  after  the  juvenile  is  taken  into  custody.  While  at  the  juvenile 
processing  office  the  guidelines  of  Family  Code  Section  52.025  must  be 
strictly adhered to: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The child may not be left unattended. 

The  child  is  entitled  to  be  accompanied  by  a  parent,  guardian,  or 
attorney. 

The  child  may  not  be  detained  in  the  juvenile  processing  office  for 
longer than six (6) hours. 

4.  Under  normal  circumstances,  no  more than  2  detectives  should  be 

actively engaged in the interrogation of the child. 

(b)  At  a  Juvenile  Detention  Facility:  To  interview  a  juvenile  who  has  been 
booked   into   Gardner-Betts   or   the  Williamson   County   Juvenile   Justice

Justice Center personnel will rule whether the request will be granted. 

1. 

The  investigator  will  call  Gardner-Betts  or  the  Williamson  County 
Juvenile Justice Center in advance to arrange for a custody transfer. 

2.  Unless the interview occurs at the detention facility, the interview will 
only take place in a designated Juvenile Processing Office that is in 
accordance with CCP Sec. 52.025. 

3.  Upon  completion  of  the  interview/statement  the  juvenile  must  be

317.6   FINGERPRINTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS 

(a)  Except as listed in section (d) below, juveniles may be photographed or fingerprinted only 

under the following circumstances consistent with provisions of the Family Code: 

1.  With consent of the Juvenile Court (e.g., via a court order). 

If  the  child  is  taken  into  custody  for  conduct  that  is  a  felony,  or  a  misdemeanor 
punishable by confinement in jail. 

If the child is not in custody and the child's parent or guardian voluntarily consents 
in writing to the photographing or fingerprinting of the child. 

(b)  The fingerprints of a juvenile suspect in a criminal case where latent prints were obtained 
may be used for comparison purposes only if the prints were obtained in a manner allowed 
by the Family Code. 

(c)  The  photograph  of  a  juvenile  suspected  in  connection  with  a  criminal  case  where  it  is 
believed the photograph will help in the identification of the offender (e.g., a photo lineup) 
may be used only if it was obtained in a manner allowed by the Family Code unless it is 
publicly available (such as in a school yearbook). 

(d)  Exceptions:  Restrictions  on  fingerprinting/photographing  juveniles  do  not  apply  in  the 

following situations: 

If the photographs/fingerprints are obtained as part of the registration process for a 
juvenile required to register as a sex offender under CCP Section 62. 

If  the  child  is  a  victim  or  witness,  and  photographs  are  needed  for  evidentiary  or 
documentary purposes (e.g., photographs of injuries, or videotaped statement of a 
child victim/witness). 

If a child has had access to a crime scene but is not a suspect, and their prints are 
needed for comparison to latents for elimination purposes.

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Detentions, Field Interviews, and Field 
Photographs 

318.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for conducting and documenting detentions, 
interviews, and taking and retaining photographs of subjects in the field. 

318.1.1   DEFINITIONS 
Consensual  Encounter  - Occurs when an officer contacts an individual but does not create a 
detention through words, actions or other means. In other words, a reasonable individual would 
believe that his contact with the officer is voluntary. 

Custody - A person is in "custody" only if, under the circumstances, a reasonable person would 
believe that his freedom of movement was restrained to the degree associated with a formal arrest. 
Custody can be construed as actual or constructive; therefore it is incumbent upon the officer to 
be conscious of the subject's belief about whether or not he is free to leave. 

Detention - The brief stopping of an individual based on reasonable suspicion for the purposes 
of determining the individual's identity and resolving the officer's suspicions. 

Field  Observation  (FO)  Card  -  The  documentation  of  a  subject  stop  when  there  is  not  a 
corresponding incident report, supplement or citation for the stop. 

Field Photographs - Posed photographs taken of a person during a contact, detention or arrest 
in the field. Undercover surveillance photographs of an individual and recordings captured by the 
normal operation of a Mobile Audio Video system when persons are not posed for the purpose of 
photographing are not considered field photographs. 

Reasonable  Suspicion  -  Occurs  when,  under  the  totality  of  the  circumstances,  an  officer  has 
articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot and a particular person is connected with that 
possible criminal activity. 

318.2   GENERAL POLICY 

(a)  Officers will identify themselves when they initiate a duty-related contact with a person, when 

practicable, unless their identity is obvious. 

(b)  Officers will explain the reason for the contact and the purpose of anticipated police action, , 

when practicable. 

(c)  Officers will act with as much restraint and courtesy toward persons interviewed, detained 

or arrested as is possible under the circumstances. 

(d)  Nothing  in  this  policy  is  intended  to  discourage  consensual  encounters.  Frequent  and 
random  casual  contacts  with  consenting  individuals  are  encouraged  by  the  Austin  Police 
Department to strengthen our community involvement, community awareness and problem 
identification.

318.3   DETENTIONS 
Detentions  are  "seizures"  under  the  Fourth  Amendment.  Officers  may  stop  and  question 
individuals when reasonable suspicion that the person may be involved in past, present or future 
criminal activity exists. 

(a) 

In  justifying  the  stop,  officers  should  be  able  to  point  to  specific  facts  which,  when  taken 
together with rational inferences, reasonably warrant the stop. Such facts include, but are 
not limited to, the following: 

1. 

The actions, appearance or demeanor of an individual suggests that he is part of a 
criminal enterprise or is engaged in a criminal act. Some factors include: 

(a)  The subject is carrying a suspicious object. 

(b)  The  subject's  clothing  bulges  in  a  manner  that  suggests  he  is  carrying  a 

weapon. 

(c)  The hour of day or night is inappropriate for the subject's presence in the area. 

(d)  The subject's presence in the particular area is suspicious. 

The subject is located in proximity to the time and place of an alleged crime. 

The  officer  has knowledge  of the  subject's  prior criminal  record  or  involvement  in

(b)  Officers should weigh the safety interests of all persons involved against the intrusion upon 

the detainee when deciding to place handcuffs on, or remove handcuffs from, a detainee. 

(c)  Unless arrested, the use of handcuffs on detainees at the scene of a search warrant should 
continue for  only  as  long  as  is reasonably  necessary  to  assure  the  safety  of  officers  and 
others. 

318.3.2   DETAINING FOREIGN NATIONALS 

(a)  Federal  courts  have  consistently  held  that  undocumented  presence  is  not  a  crime  but  a 

federal civil violation only enforceable by federal officers. 

1.  Officers shall not detain persons solely for determining immigration status. 

2. 

After  a  lawful  detention,  officers  may  continue  to  detain  foreign  nationals  for 
alleged  undocumented  presence  in  the  U.S.  if  the  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) is contacted and can respond to take custody within a reasonable 
time. 

(b)  Officers detaining a foreign national shall notify the appropriate consular official upon request 
or  when  the  detention  exceeds  two  hours.  The  Communications  Division  will  maintain  a 
current telephone list of foreign embassies and consulates and a list of mandatory notice 
countries. 

1.  Officers  shall  document in  the  narrative  of  the  appropriate  incident report the  date 
and  time  Communications  was  notified  of  the  foreign  national's  detention  and  his 
claimed nationality. 

(c)  The following additional policies cover handling foreign nationals:

Policy 319 (Custody Arrests) outlines procedures for arresting foreign nationals who

Officers  are  encouraged  to  initiate  interviews  with  people  of  the  community  in  order  to  gain  a 
thorough knowledge and become an integral part of the community. 

(a)  Officers may talk to a person at anytime, for any reason, in performance of their duties. 

(b)  An interview should be conversational and not confrontational. 

(c)  A consensual encounter is not a stop or arrest and there is no intent to inhibit any rights or 

freedoms of a person. The person has the right to:

318.5   FIELD INTERVIEWS, STATEMENTS AND CONFESSIONS 
The basis of a statement or confession is to corroborate the elements of an incident. Written and 
oral  statements  or  confessions  should  not  be  utilized  as  the  sole  basis  for  filing  charges;  any 
statement  or  confession  should  be  corroborated  by  other  legally  obtained  evidence  or  verified 
in an appropriate manner. Officers should keep in mind the following things when interviewing/ 
interrogating a subject: 

(a)  During a non-custodial interview, an officer will usually allow a subject to leave after taking 
the statement or confession. A warrant can be obtained at a later time to take the subject 
into custody. 

(b)  There  may  be  occasions  when  information  is  disclosed  that  changes  the  focus  of  the 
investigation toward the subject, where the facts and circumstances of the case dictate that 
he is no longer free to leave changing the non-custodial interview to a custodial interrogation. 

(c)  When  an  officer  begins  accusatory  questioning  of  a  subject  who  is  not  free  to  leave,  the 
subject would generally be considered under "arrest" and the interview/interrogation would 
be "custodial." 

(d)  Once  a  subject  requests  to  speak  with  an  attorney  or  indicates  a  desire  for  legal 

representation, the interview/interrogation will cease. 

318.5.1   MIRANDA WARNING 

(a)  Officers  will  administer  the  Miranda  Warning  to  a  subject  during  a  custodial  interview/ 
interrogation when questioning begins to focus on the person stopped, becoming accusatory 
regarding a specific offense. 

(b)     The  Miranda  Warning  will  be  administered  by  audio/video  recording  (e.g.,  in-car  Mobile 

Audio Video Recording system) using the following process : 

1.  Read the Miranda card to the subject in its entirety; and 

2. 

Ensure the subject acknowledges, understands, and voluntarily waives his rights by: 

(a)  Write the officer's name and the date, time, and incident number on the face 

of the card; and

If practical, request the subject to initial next to each Miranda right and sign the 
card. If the subject has verbally acknowledged understanding and waiving his 
rights but does not sign the card, the interview/interrogation may still continue. 

3.  Officer  safety  should  not  be  compromised  during  a  field  interview/interrogation  in 

order to record acknowledgment of rights. 

318.6   FIELD PHOTOGRAPHS 

(a)     Field photos should only be used for: 

Identification of a subject or a subject's automobile. 

1. 

2. 

Identification  of  a  subject's  condition  (e.g.,  injuries,  tattoos,  evidence  stains  on 
clothing, jewelry, distinctive clothing/shoe patterns). 

3.  Documenting evidence. 

(b)  Access to field photographs shall be strictly limited to law enforcement purposes. 

(c)  Force shall not be used to obtain photos in a detention situation. 

318.6.1   FIELD PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN WITH CONSENT 
Field  photographs may be  taken  when the  subject  of the  photograph knowingly  and  voluntarily 
gives  consent.  The  officer  shall  document  the  consent  in  the  appropriate  incident  report, 
supplement or FO card. 

318.6.2   FIELD PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN WITHOUT CONSENT 
Field photographs may be taken without consent only if taken during a detention that is based on 
reasonable suspicion of criminal activity and the photograph serves a legitimate law enforcement 
purpose related to the detention. 

(a)  The  officer  must  be  able  to  articulate  facts  that  reasonably  indicate  that  the  subject  was 

involved in, or was about to become involved in, criminal conduct. 

(b)  Mere knowledge or suspicion of gang membership or affiliation is not a sufficient justification 

for taking a photograph without consent. 

(c) 

If,  prior  to taking  a  photograph,  the  officer's  reasonable  suspicion  of criminal  activity  has 
been dispelled, the detention must cease and the photograph should not be taken. 

318.6.3   JUVENILE PHOTOGRAPHS 
Juveniles may only be photographed: 

(a)     With consent of the juvenile court (e.g., via a court order). 

(b) 

If the child is taken into custody for delinquent conduct that is punishable by confinement 
in jail (Class B misdemeanor or higher).

2. 

Keep a personal or shift-level copy of any photograph taken during a field stop for 
non-law enforcement purposes. 

Post a field photograph of any person not currently wanted by a law enforcement 
agency. 

318.6.5   SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY 
While it is recognized that field photographs often become valuable investigative tools, supervisors 
should  monitor  such  practices  for  compliance  with  Department  policy.  This  is  not  to  imply  that 
supervisor approval is required before each photograph.

319.2.1   WARRANT SERVICE GUIDELINES 
Officers attempting to conduct a warrant service shall adhere to the following guidelines: 

(a)  Before any warrant service is attempted at a private residence or place of employment (as 

listed in the PICKUP supplement) officers shall: 

1.  Review the incident report in its entirety to determine if and when a previous warrant 

service has been attempted. 

(a)  Officers shall not normally return to a location to serve a warrant where an 
attempt  has  been  previously  made  unless  additional  information  has  been 
developed suggesting the offender has returned. 

2. 

3. 

Verify the warrant status by contacting the Central Records/Warrant Unit or Teletype, 
either directly or through Communications. 

Supervisors  shall  be  notified  and  a  "Threat  Assessment  Form"  (APD  Form  11) 
shall be completed prior to any warrant service where a forced entry is planned or 
anticipated. 

(b)  Officers  receiving  information  that  a  person  with  an  arrest  warrant  is  inside  a  third  party 
private  residence  may  NOT  enter  and  search  for  the  violator.  Courts  have  held  that  this 
includes, but is not limited to a home, apartment, or hotel/motel room. The exception to this 
rule is when: 

(a)  The  officer  is  in  possession  of  a  valid  search  warrant  for  that  specific  residence/ 
location.  (There  is  no  requirement  for  a  search  warrant  of  PUBLIC  areas  of  a 
commercial establishment); or 

(b)  The officer has received consent from the person/s in care, custody and control of 
the location. Consent procedures are outlined in Policy 306 (Search and Seizure); or 

(c)  The  officer  can  clearly  articulate  exigent  circumstances  that  delaying  entry  would 

expose a person to serious injury or death or allow the violator to escape. 

(c)  Warrant service attempts that did not result in the arrest of a subject shall be documented 
immediately by DIRECT ENTRY of a supplement to the original incident report in Versadex. 
The following information is required in the supplement: 

(a)  Date/time of each attempt; and 

(b)  Address(s) and/or location(s) of attempt(s); and 

(c) 

Identity of person(s) contacted; and 

(d) 

Information  relating  to  the  search  of  a  location  (e.g.,  was  permission  granted  or 
refused, vacant); and 

(e)  Useful  information  relating  to  a  subject  (e.g.,  new  location,  vehicles,  employment, 

acquaintances); and

319.2.2   WARRANT HIT AND CONFIRMATION 
During the course of a lawful detention or arrest, an officer may run a subject for warrants. 
(a)  Whe 
or  th 
be th 

n a "hit" is received on a local, TCIC or NCIC warrant inquiry, confirmation from APD 
e originating agency must be obtained prior to taking official action. Confirmation shall

1. 

2. 

3. 

The person may be detained until confirmation is made by APD or the originating 
agency. 

Should circumstances make a custody arrest impractical, a person detained solely 
for a Class C warrant may be released with the approval of a supervisor. 

If a warrant confirmation is not received within 10 minutes, the arresting officer may 
either release the subject or continue to await a response. 

(b) 

If a subject is arrested for an APD warrant, officers shall: 

1.  Obtain  the  original  APD  warrant  from  the  Central  Records/Warrant  Unit  during 

normal business hours; or 

2.  Have Communications/Teletype fax or email the warrant to the jail after confirmation. 

3.  Warrants from other agencies should be faxed or emailed to the jail by the originating 

agency after confirmation. 

319.2.3   WARRANT ARRESTS AT PRIVATE RESIDENCES 

(a)  Officers legally inside a residence shall arrest any resident found to have an outstanding 

Felony, Class A or Class B misdemeanor warrant. 

(b)  Officers shall not normally arrest a resident for a Class C warrant unless authorized by a 

supervisor.

Arrests 

319.3   WARRANTLESS ARREST GUIDELINES 
These guidelines are based upon the idea that the use of an arrest, followed by prosecution, is 
not the primary or exclusive method available to officers and the Department. 

(a)  Minor  infractions  of  the  law  may  not  be  sufficient  to  justify  an  arrest.  Officers  should  be 
concerned  with  what  the  law  says  and  what  the  law  was  designed  to  accomplish.  Laws 
generally serve as the tools officers use to protect residents' rights and to maintain peace 
in  the  community.  If  enforcement  of  the  law  does  not  serve  these  purposes,  arrests  can 
rarely be justified. 

(b)  One of our concerns is the maintenance of public order, looking toward a preventive rather 

than a punitive approach to crime. 

(c)  Officers  are  not  required  to  exhaust  all  alternatives,  or  go  through  the  alternatives  in 
succession  before making  an  arrest,  but may  resort to that method  that will  most  quickly 
and safely bring the situation under control. 

(d)  Officers may consider any factors that are reasonably believed to be relevant, based upon 

observations and in light of personal knowledge, training and experience. 

(e)  Officers are expected to be able to state and describe the reason(s) for a particular course 

of action upon the request of a reviewing supervisor or the Arrest Review Unit. 

(f)  Arrests  will  not  generally  be  made  outside  the  jurisdiction  of  this  department  except  in 
cases of hot and/or fresh pursuit, while following up on crimes committed within the City, or 
while assisting another agency. On-duty officers who discover criminal activity outside the 
jurisdiction of the City should, when circumstances permit, consider contacting the agency 
having primary jurisdiction before attempting an arrest. 

319.3.1   IN-CUSTODY ARREST SITUATIONS 

(a)  Felony, Class A and Class B Misdemeanors 

1. 

Violators who commit a Class A or Class B offense and meet all the requirements 
for a Misdemeanor Citation as outlined in Policy 308 (Misdemeanor Citations) shall 
be issued a citation in lieu of arrest unless otherwise authorized by a supervisor. 

2.  Custody arrests shall be made for all other offenses greater than a Class C where 

there is a lawful arrest authority. 

(b)  Class C Misdemeanors 

1.  Class  C  misdemeanors  should  generally  be  enforced  by  a  field  release  citation. 
Officers shall select the least intrusive or severe course of enforcement action but 
should initiate a custody arrest if the issuance of a citation will not: 

(a)  Stop existing criminal conduct; or 

(b)  Remove the imminent threat of violence or criminal conduct; or

(c)  Prevent persons from endangering themselves or others. 

2. 

A custody arrest for minor offenses should be made when there is reason to believe 
the actor is, or has been, involved in a more serious offense and the arrest will serve 
to gather evidence of that additional offense. 

319.3.2   WARRANTLESS ARRESTS AT A PRIVATE RESIDENCE 

(a)  Misdemeanors 

1.  Officers shall not forcibly enter a private home to arrest a person for a misdemeanor 
violation. This  includes officers  in hot  pursuit  of a  subject,  and  cases  in which the 
subject has escaped from custody and fled into a private home. 

2.  Custody arrests shall not normally be made for a misdemeanor offense inside a home 
unless  authorized  by  a  supervisor.  However,  the  following  misdemeanor  custody 
arrests inside a home shall be made and do not require a supervisor's approval: 

(a)  The offense is committed in the officer's presence. 

(b)  Family  Violence  incidents.  Officers  shall  comply  with  current  Department 

policy regarding Family Violence. 

(c)  The offense is a violation of a valid protective order. 

3. 

4. 

Except as noted above, when a violation occurs in a private home or the person flees 
into a private home, it is preferable for the officer or a citizen to file a complaint and 
have warrants issued for the person's arrest. 

Persons  should  not  be  arrested  and  charged  with  being  intoxicated  if  they  are  on 
their own property. Subjects may be arrested if they are creating a disturbance on 
their own property and can be viewed by other persons, and the disturbance cannot 
be ended in any other manner. However, if they are not creating a disturbance and 
no other violation exists, no arrest shall be made. 

(a)  Officers  who  are  legally  inside  a  private  residence  and  observe  a  felony  being 
committed, or develop probable cause to believe a felony has been committed and 
there is no time to get a warrant, may make an arrest. 

(b)  Before  officers  forcibly  enter  a  private  home  to  arrest  for  a  felony,  they  should, 
whenever  possible,  obtain  the  approval  of  a  supervisor  and  act  only  when  the 
supervisor is present. 

(c)  When officers develop probable cause to believe a felony is being committed inside 
a private home and a bona fide emergency exists (exigent circumstances), they may

Arrests 

(d)  Officers in hot pursuit of a felony violator who flees into a private home may enter 

to effect the arrest. 

(e)  Officers  receiving  information  that  a  felony  violator  is  inside  a  private  residence 
(courts have held that this includes but is not limited to a home, apartment, or hotel/ 
motel room) may only enter and search for the violator when: 

(a)  They are in possession of a valid search warrant for the location; or 

(b)  They have received consent from the person(s) in care, custody and control 
of the location. Consent can be written or recorded electronically with audio 
and/or video; or 

(c)  They can clearly articulate that delaying entry would expose a person(s) to 

serious injury or death, or allow the violator to escape; or 

(d)  They have personally observed the felony violator enter the residence at that

319.3.3   ADDITIONAL FELONY ARREST PROCEDURES 

(a)  Most felony arrests require direct notification to the appropriate Investigative Unit. 

(b)  Officers  can  make  the  notification  by  phoning  the  Investigative  Unit  during  normal 
business  hours,  the  on-call  detective  after  business  hours,  or  the  Unit's  voice  mail  line 
designated for such notification or the city email designated for that investigative unit (e.g. 
apdburglary@austintexas.gov).  Investigative  Units  will  have  a  detective  available  on-duty 
or on-call 24 hours a day if guidance is needed or they have specific questions that need to 
be answered at that time (i.e. validity of arrest). 

1. 

2. 

The  arresting  officer  is  responsible  for  consulting  with  their  supervisor  prior  to 
notifying any on-call detective after business hours. 

Supervisors  are  responsible  for  ensuring  the  appropriate  Investigative  Unit  is 
contacted when necessary. 

(c)  The Investigative Unit will: 

1.  Help ensure the validity of the arrest; and 

2. 

Provide assistance with the appropriate wording of probable cause affidavit(s); and 

3.  Respond to the crime scene, if necessary, to provide additional expertise. 

(d)  For charges that will be direct filed, consultation with an on-call detective does not replace 

the required review of arrest paperwork by Arrest Review.

319.6   CITIZEN'S ARREST 
The purpose of this section is to provide guidance for handling arrests made by citizens pursuant 
to state law. 

319.6.1   CITIZEN ARREST AUTHORITY 
A citizen may arrest another under the following circumstances: 

(a)  When  the  offense  is  committed  in  the  citizen's  presence  or  view  and  the  offense  is  one 

classified as a felony or a breach of the peace (Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. art. 14.01). 

(b)  When there are reasonable grounds to believe property is stolen, a citizen may seize the 
stolen property and the person suspected of committing the theft and bring the person and 
the property before a magistrate or to a peace officer for that purpose (Tex. Code of Crim. 
Pro. art. 18.16). 

319.6.2   OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES 
Officers approached by a citizen making an arrest must determine whether there is probable cause 
to  believe  that  such  an  arrest  would  be  lawful.  Officers  should  not  detain  or  restrain  a  subject 
beyond that which reasonably appears necessary to safely investigate the matter and determine 
the lawfulness of the arrest. 

(a)  When officers determine there is probable cause to believe the arrest is lawful, they may 

exercise one of the following options as outlined by Department policy: 

1. 

Take the individual into physical custody for booking; or 

2.  Release the individual pursuant to a field release citation. 

(b)  When officers determine there is insufficient arrest authority or that there does not appear 

to be probable cause for a lawful arrest, they will promptly release the arrested individual. 

1.  Officers should advise the parties that no arrest will be made at that time and that 
the circumstances will be documented in an incident report. Officers will document 
the basis of the release in the incident report. 

2. 

If the citizen is the victim of a crime that does not have a warrantless arrest authority 
and  the  person  wants  to  file  charges,  officers  should  give  the  citizen  the  incident 
number and the phone number for the Investigative Unit that will perform any follow- 
up review. 

319.7   ASSISTING OTHER AGENCIES 

319.7.1   ASSISTING WITH OTHER AGENCIES WARRANT SERVICE

shall not return to a location to serve a warrant where an attempt has been previously 
made,  unless  additional  information  has  been  developed  suggesting  the  offender 
has/will return. 

(c)     If an arrest of the wanted subject is made: 

1.  Officers  shall  transport  the  subject  to  jail  for  booking  and/or  magistration  in

in compliance with Department policy governing relations with other law enforcement agencies. 
All follow-up investigations, booking, and filing of complaints shall remain the responsibility of the 
arresting agency. 

(a)  Under CCP Article 14.03(d) and (g), peace officers have statewide arrest authority in many 
situations, even when outside the peace officer's jurisdiction. APD may be called upon to 
take custody of a subject for any arrest made in the City of Austin by a peace officer whose 
jurisdiction does not include the City of Austin: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

APD officers shall handle the case complying with CCP 14.03(d) or (g).

Positional  asphyxia  occurs  when  the  physical  position  of  the  body  interferes  with  normal 
respiration. Such a position can be induced by the use of one or more restraints. Officers in control 
of a restrained person must be alert to the physical position of the person in order to minimize the 
possibility of positional asphyxia.

in the front seat where the transporting officer can maintain observation and control 
of the prisoner. 

(e)  Once secured in the vehicle, prisoners should not be allowed to talk with anyone other than 

police or medical personnel.

321.4   SUBSTANCE INDUCED EXCITED DELIRIUM 

(a)  Substance Induced Excited Delirium is a condition brought on by the use of drugs or the lack 
of required medication. Subjects in this state often have easily identifiable symptoms and 
behavioral patterns. For the safety of both officers and subjects, recognition of this condition 
is imperative. This is especially true in cases when more than two or three symptoms are 
exhibited  at  the  same  time  by  the  same  person.  Some  of  the  symptoms  exhibited  may 
include: 

1. 

Bizarre and/or aggressive behavior such as self-inflicted injuries, jumping into water, 
hiding behind objects, or public disrobing (due to high body temp). 

2. 

Irrational or incoherent speech or shouting; 

3.  Dilated pupils, shivering, high body temperature, or profuse sweating; 

Fear, paranoia, or panic; 

4. 

5. 

Violence toward others, objects, or in general; 

6.  High resistance to pain (standard defensive tactics and OC spray may be ineffective); 

7.  Unexpected physical strength. 

(b)     For safety, officers should only engage a subject displaying symptoms of Substance Induced 

Excited Delirium when adequate back-up assistance is present. 

(c)  Subjects  who  display  these  symptoms  and  initially  resist  arrest  violently  may  become 
suddenly calm. They may seem to be sleepy and resting. This is termed "sudden tranquility" 
and usually indicates an immediate need for medical attention. 

(d)  Once the prisoner is in custody, EMS shall be contacted immediately to evaluate a subject 

exhibiting these symptoms. 

321.5   PRISONERS REQUIRING MEDICAL ATTENTION 
The intent of the Department is to quickly provide each ill or injured prisoner with medical attention. 
Prisoners  shall  be  treated for  injuries  before  being  booked  into  jail. This  includes subjects  who 
have been subjected to Response to Resistance techniques. (Refer to Chapter 2 on Response 
to Resistance Policies).

1. 

2. 

3. 

1. 

In circumstances where prisoners are arrested on for non-violent offenses and there 
is no reason to believe the prisoner will become violent, a supervisor may authorize 
the  prisoner's  release  if the  prisoner  is  being  admitted  into  the  hospital.  Prisoners 
will  not  be  released  from  custody  if  they  are  under  arrest  for  an  offense  involving 
violence or have outstanding warrants higher than a Class C Misdemeanor.

Police Observer Program 

(o)  Citizens  may  only  ride  once  per  calender  quarter  unless  otherwise  approved  by  the 
appropriate  commander;  however,  City  Council  members  and  personnel  from  the  City 
Manager's Office may ride more than once per calender quarter provided they comply with

(p)  Persons who have a pending lawsuit against the Department shall not be allowed to ride as 

an observer while the lawsuit is active. 

(q)  For staffing and operational issues, supervisors may decline to have an observer ride on a 
particular shift; if the observer is otherwise approved to participate, supervisors will make 
every effort to assign the observer to another shift or to reschedule the observer for a future 
time. 

(r)  Participation  may  be  terminated  by  an  officer  at  any  time  because  of  the  unacceptable 
behavior of the observer. In such a case, the officer shall immediately notify a supervisor 
about the situation. 

(s)  Members  of  the  APD  Explorer  Program  may  ride  at  the  age  of  16  if  they  meet  the 

requirements of the APD Explorer Unit SOP's. 

1. 

If for any reason the assigned officer feels it is in the best interest of the APD Explorer 
or the department, they can terminate the observation period at any time. Any early 
release of an APD Explorer should be reported as soon as practical to the post officer 
or advisor. 

324.1.2   DEPARTMENT EMPLOYEE OBSERVERS 

(a)  On-duty  civilian  employees may  ride  as  an  observer  with  the  approval  of their supervisor 
and  the  appropriate  lieutenant  or  designee.  The Police Observer  Information  Form  is  not 
required.

are  not  required  to  list  their  address  on  the  Police  Observer  Information  Form.  Off-duty 
employees are not allowed to ride more than once per calender quarter without the approval 
of the appropriate commander.

familiarization)  and  the  request  has  been  approved  by  an  assistant  chief  or  designee.  If  such 
officers desire to ride merely as off-duty police observers, they must comply with regulations set 
out in this policy as a citizen observer.

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

News and Media Relations 

326.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The purpose of this policy is to seek a balance between permitting the free flow of information to 
the public and the media while protecting both the prosecution's case and the rights of the accused 
from possible prejudicial publicity. Public information and positive media relations are an integral 
part of the operation of any public service agency and APD is no exception. Most citizens have little 
contact with law enforcement and their opinions of the police are often formed by our Department's 
portrayal in the media. The release of public information and maintenance of good media relations 
is a crucial element of APD's mission. Employees must maintain a good rapport with the public 
and the media and deal with them in a courteous manner. The media has a legitimate function in 
our society and the public trust of the police can be enhanced through media relations. 

APD is committed to informing the community and members of the news media of events that are 
handled  by,  or  involve,  the  Department.  Employees  will  cooperate fully  in meeting  the  relevant 
information needs of the public and the news media. Every reasonable effort should be made to 
obtain requested information, so long as the release of that information conforms to federal and 
state laws, and follows established Department guidelines. 

326.2   RELEASE OF PUBLIC INFORMATION 
APD's  Public  Information  Office  (PIO)  is  responsible  for  collecting  police  information  and  then 
fairly, equitably and efficiently disseminating it to the public and media. PIO's primary function is 
to  act  as  a  liaison  between  the  public,  the  news  media  and  the  Department  and  to  coordinate 
all of the Department's release of public information. However, any employee may release non- 
protected information to the media. 

During regular weekday business hours, PIO personnel will respond to the scene as determined 
by  PIO.  After  office hours  the  on-call  PIO  will  coordinate with  the ranking  on-scene officer  and 
make the determination if PIO needs to respond. If the on-call PIO does not respond to the scene, 
they will send pager notification to the media with information about the incident. The ranking on- 
scene officer will be responsible for media interviews at the scene. 

326.2.1   MEDIA REQUEST GUIDELINES 
Any media request for information or access to a law enforcement situation shall be referred to the 
designated PIO representative, or if unavailable, to the ranking on-scene officer. Prior to releasing 
any information to the media, employees shall consider the following: 

(a)  Employees  releasing  information  will  ensure  that  the  information  is  releasable  and  sheds 
a  positive  light  on  the  City,  APD  and  the  law  enforcement  community.  Information  of  a 
controversial nature will be directed to the PIO. 

(b) 

In  situations  involving  multiple  law  enforcement  agencies,  every  reasonable  effort  should 
be made to coordinate media releases with the authorized representative of each involved 
agency prior to the release of any information by this department.

(c)  Under no circumstance should any member of this department make any comment(s) to the 
media regarding any  law  enforcement  incident not  involving  this  department  without  prior 
approval of the Chief of Police. 

Media personnel are not exempt from any federal or state law, or any local ordinance and will be 
treated in the same manner as any other person violating the law. 

Employees  who  encounter  issues  with  the  media  should  initiate  a  memorandum  through  their 
chain-of-command  to  the  PIO  Commander  clearly  outlining  the  situation  and  identifying,  if 
possible, those involved.

PIO; or 

(b)  Employees  contacted  directly  by  the  media  and  who  want  to  provide  an 

interview will: 

1.  Notify their supervisor if the interview is regarding an open or ongoing 
investigation  and  request  approval  before  conducting  the  interview; 
and

326.3   MEDIA ACCESS 
Authorized  members  of  the  media  shall  be  provided  access  to  scenes  of  disasters,  criminal 
investigations,  emergencies  and  other  law  enforcement  activities  subject  to  the  following 
conditions: 

(a)  The  media  representative  shall  produce  valid  press  credentials  that  shall  be  prominently 

displayed at all times while in areas otherwise closed to the public. 

(b)  Media  representatives  will  not  be  allowed  to  interfere  with  emergency  operations  and 
criminal investigations. Media personnel may not resist, obstruct or otherwise interfere with 
an officer in the lawful execution of his duty. However, the mere presence of a member of 
the  media,  the  taking  of  pictures  or  the  asking  of  questions  does  not,  in  itself,  constitute 
unlawful interference. 

1.  Reasonable effort should be made to provide a safe staging area for the media that 
is near the incident and that will not interfere with emergency or criminal investigation 
operations. All information released to the media should be coordinated through PIO 
or other designated spokesperson. 

2.  Whenever the presence of media or other aircraft pose a threat to public or officer 
safety  or  significantly  hampers  incident  operations,  the  field  supervisor  should 
consider  requesting  a  Temporary  Flight  Restriction  (TFR).  All  requests  for  a  TFR 
should  be  routed  through  the  Watch  Lieutenant.  The  TFR  request  should  include 
specific information regarding the perimeter and altitude necessary for the incident 
and should be requested through the appropriate control tower. If the control tower 
is not known, the Federal Aviation Administration should be contacted (14 CFR § 
91.137). 

(c)  No member of this department shall be subjected to media visits or interviews without the

(d)  Media  interviews  with  individuals  who  are  in  custody  shall  not  be  permitted  without  the 
approval of the PIO Manager, Investigative Unit supervisor and the expressed consent of 
the person in custody.

should  extend  only  for  the  length  of  time  necessary  to  achieve  a  specifically  approved 
objective of the media. 

A tactical operation should be handled in the same manner as a crime scene, except the news 
media  should  be  permitted  within  the  outer  perimeter  of  the  scene,  subject  to  any  restrictions 
as determined by the supervisor in charge. Department members shall not jeopardize a tactical 
operation in order to accommodate the news media. During the tactical operation, all comments 
to the media shall be coordinated through a supervisor or PIO.

Bias-Based Profiling 

328.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The  Austin  Police  Department  strives  to  provide  law  enforcement  services  to  our  diverse 
community with due regard to the racial, cultural or other inherent differences of those we serve. 
It shall be the policy and practice of this department to provide law enforcement services and to 
enforce the law equally and fairly without discrimination toward any individual(s) or group. Race, 
ethnicity or nationality, religion, gender, sexual orientation, economic status, age, cultural group, 
disability, or affiliation with any other similar identifiable group shall not be utilized as the basis for 
providing differing levels of law enforcement service or the enforcement of the law. 

328.2   DEFINITION 
Bias-Based  Profiling  -  Any  pattern  or  practice  that  includes,  but  is  not  limited  to,  stopping, 
detaining,  frisking,  or  searching  of  subjects  by  police  officers  based  on  an  individual's  race, 
ethnicity,  nationality,  religion,  gender,  sexual  orientation,  economic  status,  age,  cultural  group, 
disability,  or  affiliation  with  any  other  similar  identifiable  group  rather  than  on  the  individual's 
behavior or on information identifying the individual as having engaged in criminal activity. 

Racial Profiling - Bias-based profiling specifically dealing with initiating a law enforcement action 
based  on  an  individual's  race,  ethnicity  or  nationality.  (Tex.  Code  of  Crim.  Pro.  art.  3.05,  and 
2.132(b)(1)). 

328.3   POLICY 
Police action must be based upon credible information known to the officer, which leads them to 
believe that an individual is, has been, or is about to be engaged in activity that is in violation of 
the law. Any other motivation for such actions is strictly prohibited. 

(a)     The practice of bias-based profiling shall not be tolerated by the Department. 

(b)  Officers shall ensure that the stopping, detaining, frisking, and/or searching of residents is 
based upon solid legal principles that conform to their training in arrest, search, and seizure. 

(c)  While the practice of racial profiling is strictly prohibited, it is recognized that race or ethnicity 
may be legitimately considered by an officer in combination with other legitimate factors to 
establish reasonable suspicion or probable cause (e.g., subject description is limited to a 
specific race or group). 

328.4   TRAINING 
All sworn members of this department will complete all Texas Commission on Law Enforcement 
(TCOLE) mandated training on the subject of bias-based profiling.

Bias-Based Profiling 

328.5   COMPLIANCE 
The Austin Police Department will investigate all complaints involving bias-based profiling by any 
employee as outlined in Policy 902 (Administrative Investigation Procedures). 

328.5.1   DISCIPLINARY ACTION 
Officers are not subject to disciplinary action based solely on the statistical data collected as a 
result of this policy. It is the motivating action(s) and/or inaction(s) of officers that will constitute 
the basis of any internal disciplinary action. 

328.6   REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION 
The Austin Police Department profoundly rejects the practice of bias-based profiling and attempts 
to accurately document officer-initiated contacts with the public. Documentation requirements are 
located in Policy 402 (Incident Reporting and Documentation). 

328.7   ANNUAL REPORT 
The Chief of Police shall submit an annual report as required by Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. § 2.132(b) 
to TCOLE and each governing body served by this agency. Further, unless exempt under Tex. 
Code  of  Crim.  Pro.  art.  2.135,  each  year  prior  to  March  1,  the  Chief  of  Police  shall  provide  to 
TCOLE and to each governing body served by this agency a report containing an analysis of the 
information required by Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. art. 2.133 (Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. art. 2.134(b)).

Foreign Officials Claiming Immunity 

330.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The  Vienna  Convention  on  Consular  Relations  sets  forth  certain  rights  of  foreign  officials  from 
member  countries  when  they  are  arrested,  detained  or  imprisoned  by  U.S.  law  enforcement 
officials in this country. This policy provides direction to officers when considering a physical arrest 
or detention of a foreign officials claiming Diplomatic Immunity. 

As  noted  herein,  the  United  States  is  a  party  to  several  bilateral  agreements  that  obligate 
authorities to notify the consulate upon the person's detention, regardless of whether the detained 
person requests his consulate to be notified. 

A list of specific countries that the United States is obligated to notify is maintained by the U.S. 
Department of State. CTECC will maintain contact information for the U. S. Department of State, 
a  current  telephone  list  of  foreign  embassies  and  consulates,  and  a  list  of  mandatory  notice 
countries. 

330.1.1   DEFINITIONS 
Foreign National - Anyone who is not a citizen of the United States. A person with dual U.S. and 
foreign citizenship is not a foreign national. 

Foreign  Official  -  A  foreign  national  serving  in  the  capacity  of  ambassador,  United  Nations 
representative, consular officer, or other diplomatic agent who may be entitled to certain immunity. 
In  certain  cases,  immediate  family  members  of  a  foreign  official  are  also  entitled  to  certain 
immunity. 

Immunity   -  Refers to various protections and privileges extended to the employees of foreign 
governments who are present in the U.S. as official representatives of their home governments. 
These  privileges  are  embodied  in  international  law  and  are  intended  to  ensure  the  efficient 
and effective performance of their official "missions" (i.e., embassies and consulates) in foreign 
countries. Proper respect for the immunity to which an individual is entitled is necessary to ensure 
that  U.S.  diplomatic  relations  are  not  jeopardized  and  to  maintain  reciprocal  treatment  of  U.S. 
personnel abroad. 

Although  immunity  may  preclude  U.S.  courts  from  exercising  jurisdiction,  it  is  not  intended  to 
excuse  unlawful  activity.  It  is  the  policy  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  State's  Office  of  Foreign 
Missions (OFM) that illegal acts by foreign service personnel should always be pursued through 
proper channels. Additionally, the host country's right to protect its citizens supersedes immunity 
privileges. Peace officers may intervene to the extent necessary to prevent the endangerment of 
public safety or the commission of a serious crime, regardless of immunity claims. 

330.1.2   ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES FOR FOREIGN NATIONALS NOT ENTITLED TO 
IMMUNITY 
Policy 319 (Custody Arrests) outlines specific procedures for handling foreign nationals who are 
not entitled to immunity.

Foreign Officials Claiming Immunity 

330.2   LEVELS OF IMMUNITY 
The specific degree of immunity afforded to foreign service personnel within the U.S. is directly 
related to their function and position in this country. 

330.2.1   DIPLOMATIC AGENTS 
Diplomatic  agents  (e.g.,  ambassadors  and  United  Nations  representatives)  are  afforded  the 
highest  levels  of  immunity.  They  are  exempt  from  arrest  or  detention  and  are  immune  from  all 
criminal (and most civil) prosecution by the host state. The family members of diplomatic agents 
enjoy these same immunities. Currently there are no diplomatic agents permanently assigned to 
Texas; but they do occasionally visit the state. 

330.2.2   CONSULAR OFFICERS 
Consular officers are the ranking members of consular posts who perform various formal functions 
on behalf of their own governments. Typical titles include consul general, consul and vice consul. 
These officials are immune from arrest or detention, except pursuant to a felony warrant. They are 
only immune from criminal and civil prosecution arising from official acts. Official acts immunity 
must be raised as an affirmative defense in the court of jurisdiction, and its validity is determined 
by the court. Under this defense, the prohibited act itself must have been performed as an official 
function. It is not sufficient that the consular agent was on-duty or in an official capacity at the time 
of the violation. The family members of consular officers generally enjoy no immunity, however, 
any family member who enjoys a higher level of immunity is issued an identification card by the 
Department  of  State (DOS)  enumerating  any  privileges  or  immunities  on  the  back  of  the  card. 
Examples are consular officers and family members from Russia or China. 

330.2.3   HONORARY CONSULS 
Honorary consuls are part-time employees of the country they represent and are either permanent 
residents of the U.S. or U.S. nationals (unlike career consular officers, who are foreign nationals 
on temporary assignment to the U.S.). Honorary consuls may be arrested and detained; limited 
immunity for official acts may be available as a subsequent defense. Family members have no 
immunity. There are less than 100 honorary consuls in Texas. 

330.3   IDENTIFICATION 
All  diplomatic  and  consular  personnel  who  are  entitled  to  immunity  are  registered  with  the 
Department  of  State  and  are  issued  distinctive  identification  cards  by  the  Department  of  State 
Protocol  Office. These cards  are  the  best  means  of  identifying foreign  service personnel. They 
include a photograph, identifying information, and, on the reverse side, a brief description of the 
bearer's immunity status. Unfortunately, these identification cards are not always promptly issued 
by  the  Department  of  State.  In  addition  to  the  Department  of  State  identification  card,  Foreign 
Service personnel should also have a driver license issued by the Department of State Diplomatic 
Motor Vehicle Office (DMVO), which in most circumstances replaces the operator's license issued 
by the state.

330.3.1   VEHICLE REGISTRATION 
Vehicles that are owned by foreign missions or foreign service personnel and their dependents are 
registered with the Department of State OFM and display distinctive red, white and blue license 
plates. Vehicles assigned to diplomatic or consular officers will generally have license plate labels 
with the words "diplomat" or "consul." Vehicles owned by honorary consuls are not issued OFM 
license  plates;  but  may  have  Texas  license  plates  with  an  "honorary  consul"  label.  A  driver's 
identity or immunity status should not be presumed from the type of license plates displayed on 
the vehicle. The status of an OFM license plate should be run via the National Law Enforcement 
Telecommunications System (NLETS), designating "U.S." as the state, if the officer has reason 
to question the legitimate possession of the license plate. 

330.4   ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES 
The following procedures provide a guideline for handling incidents involving foreign officials who 
claim some form of immunity: 

330.4.1   CITABLE OFFENSES 
A citation shall be issued at the scene for all violations warranting such action regardless of the 
violator's  immunity  status.  The  issuance  of  a  citation  is  not  considered  an  arrest  or  detention 
under current Department of State guidelines. Whenever a citation is issued to a subject claiming 
immunity, these additional procedures shall be followed by the arresting officer: 

(a)     Supervisors  shall  be  promptly  notified  and  should  respond  to  the  scene  when  possible. 

Supervisors shall ensure the Watch Lieutenant is notified of the incident. 

(b) 

Identification documents are to be requested of the subject. 

(c)  The  title  and  country  represented  by  the  subject  are  to  be  recorded  on  the  back  of  the 
officer's copy of the citation for later reference. Do not include this information on the front 
of the citation. 

(d)  The subject shall be requested to sign the citation. If the subject refuses, the identity and 

immunity status of the individual shall be conclusively established. 

1. 

2. 

Verified diplomatic agents and consular officers, including staff and family members 
from countries with which the U.S. has special agreements, are not required to sign 
the citation. The word "refused" shall be entered in the signature box and the violator 
shall be released. 

Verified consular staff members, excluding those from countries with which the U.S. 
has special agreements, are generally obligated to sign the citation but a signature 
shall not be required if their immunity status is uncertain. 

(e)     The violator shall be provided with the appropriate copy of the citation. 

(f)      Officers and supervisor will adhere to the reporting procedures outlined below in this policy.

330.4.2   DETENTION AND CUSTODY ARREST GUIDELINES 

(a)  Diplomatic  agents  and  consular  officers  are  immune  from  arrest  or  detention  unless 
they  have  no  identification  and  the  detention  is  to  verify  their  diplomatic  status.  Proper 
identification of subjects claiming immunity is imperative in potential custody situations. 

Subjects  who  are  placed  under  arrest  and  claim  diplomatic  or  consular  immunity 
shall not be physically restrained before verification of the claim unless restraint is 
necessary for the protection of the officer or others. 

Supervisors  shall  be  promptly  notified  and  should  respond  to  the  scene  when 
possible. Supervisors shall ensure the Watch Lieutenant is notified of the incident. 

(b)  Field verification of the subjects identity is to be attempted as follows: 

Identification  cards  issued  by  the  Department  of  State  Protocol  Office  are  the 
only  valid  evidence  of  diplomatic  or  consular  immunity.  The  following  types  of 
identification cards are issued: Diplomatic (blue bordered), Consular (red bordered), 
Official  (green  bordered).  The  Department  of  State  identification  cards  are  3-3/4 
inches by 1-1/2 inches and contain a photograph of the bearer. 

Initiate telephone verification with the Department of State. Newly arrived members 
of  diplomatic  or  consular  missions  may  not  yet  have  official  Department  of  State 
identity documents. Verify immunity by telephone with the Department of State any 
time an individual claims immunity and cannot present satisfactory identification, the 
officer has reason to doubt the claim of immunity, or there is a possibility of physical 
arrest. Officers can contact CTECC for the appropriate contact phone numbers.

3.  Members   of   diplomatic   or   consular  missions   may   also   have  other  forms  of 
identification. These include identification cards issued by the Office of Emergency 
Services, local law enforcement agencies, the foreign embassy, or consulate; driver 
licenses issued by the Department of State; and, Department of State license indicia 
on the vehicle. All these items are only an indication that the bearer may have some 
form of immunity. 

(c)  Subjects verified through the above procedures as being officials entitled to immunity may 
not be subject to a custody arrest; the procedures below shall be followed instead. These 
procedures should also be used in the event immunity cannot be verified but another form 
of identification indicates that immunity is probable. Supervisor approval is required for 
all custody arrests and releases when a claim of immunity is involved. 

1. 

If the release of the violator will not create an additional hazard, adequate information 
to properly identify the violator shall be obtained then the official shall be released. 
The necessary release documents (e.g., citation) should only be issued under the 
proper conditions.

If the violator appears to have been driving while under the influence, field sobriety 
tests should be offered. The subject shall not be permitted to drive and alternative 
transportation should be arranged: 

(a)  All facts of the incident shall be documented in accordance with this policy in 
a Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) Incident Report and/or any other relevant 
report form. Prosecution is still appropriate and should be pursued. 

(b)  The DWI Unit shall contact the Department of State, as soon as practicable, 
to  verify  the  violator's  status  and  immunity. Within five  working  days  of  the 
stop, the DWI Unit shall send to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security Office of 
Foreign  Missions  of  the  Department  of  State  a  copy  of  the  citation  and/or 
any accident or other written report documenting the incident (Tex. Transp. 
Code  §  543.011  et  seq.).  The  Department  of  State  will  take  appropriate 
sanctions against errant foreign service personnel, even where prosecution 
is not undertaken by the agency. 

(d)  Foreign consular officials have the right to visit their arrested or detained nationals unless 

the person objects to the visit. 

(e)     Officers and supervisor will adhere to the reporting procedures outlined below in this policy. 

330.5   TRAFFIC COLLISIONS 
Persons involved  in a traffic  crash  who  possess  a  Department  of  State OFM  Diplomatic  Driver 
License issued by the DMVO, shall have "D" coded in the license "class" box of the Traffic Crash 
Report. The actual driver license class (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or A, B, C, M) shall be entered on the traffic 
report. If subsequent prosecution of the subject is anticipated, the subject's title, country and type 
of identification presented should be recorded for future reference. 

(a)  Supervisors shall be promptly notified when a foreign official claiming immunity is involved 
in a crash and respond to the scene when practicable. Supervisors shall ensure the Watch 
Lieutenant is notified. 

(b) 

Issuance  of  a  citation  or  arresting  a  subject  claiming  immunity  at  a  crash  scene  shall  be 
handled as outlined in the previous section of this policy. 

330.5.1   VEHICLES 
Vehicles  which  are  owned  by  subjects  with  full  immunity  may  not  be  searched,  stored  or

Austin Police Department 
Policy Manual

 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Traffic Enforcement 

342.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Officers shall enforce traffic regulations in a uniform, impartial manner. It is imperative for public 
acceptance that individuals committing identical offenses under similar conditions/circumstances 
be accorded the same treatment by an officer. To cite one person for an offense and warn another 
for the same offense committed to the same degree, under similar conditions and circumstances, 
is improper. 

The guidelines established in this policy are applicable to both adults and juveniles. 

342.2   TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT POLICY 

(a)  On-duty  officers  in  uniform  should  stop  the  operator  of  any  vehicle  committing  a  traffic 

violation when practical to do so. 

(b)  On-duty officers not in uniform may make traffic stops only if the vehicle used in making the 

traffic stop is equipped with emergency lights and a siren. 

(c)  After   stopping  the   violator,   officers   shall   exercise  good  judgment   in   deciding  what 

enforcement action should be taken (e.g., warning, citation, arrest). 

(d)     A traffic citation should only be issued when: 

The violator has sufficient identification; and 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

The officer has no substantial reason to believe the violator will fail to appear; and 

The officer has reason to believe that release by citation will result in termination of 
the violation; and 

The violator(s) did not resist detention, assault anyone during the offense, or appear 
to be combative or violent; and 

5. 

The violator is willing to sign the citation. 

342.2.1   SUFFICIENT SUBJECT IDENTIFICATION 

(a)  Officers should make every effort to sufficiently identify a driver or passenger prior to issuing 
a citation. If it is not possible to sufficiently identify a subject and the officer has an arrest 
authority, a custody arrest may be made. 

(b)  Subjects  whose  identity  is  in  question  and  are  being  issued  a  citation  or  booked  into  jail 
shall be transported to the APD ID section to verify their identity prior to issuing the citation 
or booking into jail. 

342.2.2   SPEEDING 
In situations where officers stop a driver for speeding only, officers may not arrest the driver solely 
for this violation unless (Tex. Transp. Code § 543.004):

Traffic Enforcement 

(a)     The driver does not have sufficient identification; or 

(b)     The driver refuses to sign a citation, or 

(c)     The violation is a component of a more serious violation (e.g., reckless driving, DWI, racing). 
When an arrest is made for the more serious violation, officers shall not issue a citation or 
charge the violator with speeding. 

342.2.3   OPEN CONTAINER 
Possession of Alcoholic Beverage in a Motor Vehicle is a Class C Misdemeanor (Tex. Penal Code 
§ 49.031) and must be observed by the officer before a citation can be issued. 

(a)     Officers may not arrest solely for this violation unless (Tex. Transp. Code § 543.004): 

1. 

2. 

The violator does not have sufficient identification; or 

The violator refuses to sign a citation. 

342.2.4   FAILURE TO MAINTAIN FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
When drivers who do not have current proof of insurance, officers shall make an inquiry through 
the Texas Sure Database to confirm if the driver has insurance on file. 

(a)  The inquiry shall be performed on the MDC or through Communications by running a license 

plate check. 

(b) 

If the Texas Sure Database is not accessible during the stop, officers shall note on the back 
of the citation "SURE was down". 

342.2.5   MULTIPLE HAZARDOUS TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS 
When  an  officer  observes  a  driver  that  has  committed  multiple  hazardous  traffic  violations,  a 
custody arrest may be made with supervisor approval. 

(a)     The intent is to remove an obviously dangerous driver from the roadway. 

(b)     Generally, three or more hazardous violations should be observed by an officer. 

342.3   REFUSAL TO SIGN A CITATION 
Officers shall explain the consequences when a violator refuses to sign a citation. If the violator 
continues to refuse, the officer shall request a supervisor at the scene. 

The supervisor shall confirm that the violator understands the consequences of refusing to sign 
the citation and may order the violator taken into custody if the violator continues to refuse to sign 
the citation. 

342.4   SUBMISSION OF TRAFFIC CITATIONS 
Officers shall submit all court copies of issued traffic tickets to a Municipal Court drop box by the 
end of their tour of duty. Drop boxes are located at the various substations.

342.5   CORRECTION AND DISMISSAL OF TRAFFIC CITATIONS 

(a)  Correction of Citations 

1.  When a traffic citation is issued and in need of correction, officers issuing the citation 
shall submit the citation and a memorandum requesting a specific correction to their 
immediate supervisor. The citation and letter shall then be forwarded to the Traffic 
Office.  The  Traffic  Office  shall  prepare  a  letter  of  correction  to  the  court  having 
jurisdiction and to the recipient of the citation. 

(b)  Dismissal of Citations 

1. 

2. 

APD  employees  do  not  have  the  authority  to  dismiss  a  citation  once  it  has  been 
issued; only the court has the authority to dismiss a citation that has been issued. 
Any request from a recipient to dismiss a citation shall be referred to the court. 

Should an officer determine that a traffic citation should be dismissed in the interest 
of  justice  or  where  prosecution  is  deemed  inappropriate,  the  officer  will  write  a 
memorandum to his commander explaining the reason for the dismissal and attach 
a  copy  of  the  citation  and  a  completed  copy  of  the  Municipal  Court's  "Motion  for 
Dismissal"  related  to  the  citation.  The  officer  should  also  discuss  the  citation  with 
the  Municipal  Court  prosecutor  when  submitting  the  required  form  requesting  the 
dismissal. 

342.6   CITATION ACCOUNTABILITY 
Citation books are stored and secured in PCO. Officers shall: 

(a)  Sign for all issued citation books by legibly printing their name, employee number and signing 

on the designated form or log book. 

(b)  Be accountable for all citations issued. 

(c)  Return all outdated citation books to PCO. 

342.6.1   LOST, STOLEN, MISPLACED, DAMAGED, OR VOIDED TRAFFIC CITATIONS 

(a)  Officers  will  notify  their  supervisor  if  an  issued  citation  book  or  individual  citation  is  lost, 

stolen, misplaced, damaged, or voided. 

(b)  Supervisors      will      review      the      incident      and      email      Municipal      Court      at 
Municipal.Court@austintexas.gov  with  the  citation  number(s)  and  notification  that  the 
citation was lost, stolen, misplaced, damaged, or voided. 

342.7   SPECIAL TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT SITUATIONS 

342.7.1   CONSULAR AND DIPLOMATIC PERSONNEL 
Foreign consular officials enjoy varying degrees of immunity from arrest, which may include traffic 
violations/citations. See Policy 330 (Foreign Officials Claiming Immunity) for more information.

342.7.2   FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATORS 
Numerous  federal  and  state  legislators  have  offices  within  the  City  of  Austin.  During  official 
legislative  sessions,  including  travel  to  and  from  sessions,  senators  and  representatives  are 
immune from citations and arrest except for felonies and breaches of the peace. 

(a)  Officers shall notify their supervisor when enforcement action (e.g., arrest, citation) is taken 

against a senator or representative. 

(b)     Supervisors shall ensure the Watch Lieutenant is notified. 

342.7.3   MILITARY PERSONNEL 
Personnel of the Armed Forces of the United States (including National Guard) are exempt from 
state driver's licensing requirements while operating an official motor vehicle in the scope of that 
service.  While  operating  a  private  vehicle,  active  duty  non-resident  military  personnel  are  not 
required to hold a Texas driver's license; however, they must possess a current driver's license 
issued by another state.

Policy Manual

 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Escorts and Traffic Control 

343.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This  policy  provides  guidelines  to  Department  personnel  who  encounter  traffic  situations  that 
require the  use of  alternative  methods of  enforcement,  traffic  direction, utilization of  personnel, 
and specialized equipment or assistance. 

343.2   ESCORTS FOR MEDICAL PURPOSES 
It  is  the  policy  of  this  Department  to  provide  medical  aid  to  persons  requesting,  or  in  need  of, 
assistance. Employees should weigh the hazards and traffic dangers involved in providing escorts 
against the timely response of EMS or AFD. 

(a)  When confronted by a person requesting medical assistance, and if the patient's condition 

does not appear immediately life-threatening, personnel will: 

1.  Make every effort to provide first aid, if needed, and notify Communications to request 

EMS/AFD be dispatched; or 

2. 

Provide  directions  to  the  nearest  (or  requested)  hospital  and  allow  the  person  to 
proceed; or 

3. 

Provide a Code I escort to the hospital. 

(b)  Due to the inherent liability of an untrained driver following an emergency vehicle and the 
fact that EMS/AFD can respond within minutes to virtually any location within the City, Code 
2 or Code 3 escorts will NOT normally be conducted. 

1.  However, when in the officer's opinion the extent of injuries or illness is immediately 
life-threatening and awaiting EMS/AFD would cause an inordinate delay in treatment, 
the officer will request supervisory approval for a Code 3 escort to the closest hospital 
emergency room. 

2. 

3. 

If approved, Communications will be notified before initiating the escort. 

The  officer's  primary  function  is  to  clear  traffic,  guiding  the  vehicle  containing  the 
patient safely to the hospital. 

343.3   DIGNITARY AND VIP ESCORTS 
Coordination  of  escorts for  local  or  visiting dignitaries/VIPs  will  be  handled  through  the  Special 
Events  and  Executive  Protection  Units.  Normally,  these  type  events  will  be  pre-planned  and 
necessary personnel assigned to provide adequate traffic assistance and personal protection. 

343.4   UNUSUAL TRAFFIC INCIDENTS 
Situations may occur that require numerous officers to assist with traffic direction. Each occurrence 
will vary and may require significantly different approaches. Resources and personnel from various

Escorts and Traffic Control 

(a)  Major collisions (e.g., fatalities, serious injury, officer involved, roadway blocked). 

(b)  Aircraft crashes. 

(c)  Hazardous Materials (e.g., spills, ruptures). 

(d)  Fires or power failure. 

(e) 

Inclement weather (e.g., ice, flooding). 

(f) 

Tactical situations (e.g., hostage, barricaded subject, civil unrest). 

(g)  Major planned events. 

343.5   TRAFFIC CONTROL GUIDELINES 
When officers must provide traffic control and direction it is important to remember the inherent 
dangers involved. These guidelines should be followed to make it as safe and efficient as possible. 

(a)  Officers will notify Communications of their location prior to directing traffic in the roadway. 

(b)  Officers  will  keep  Communications  informed  of  any  lane  or  street  closures  during  major 

situations. 

(c) 

It should be remembered that fatigue and monotony can increase the danger of this type 
of assignment. Supervisors should schedule breaks for officers working traffic for extended 
periods of time. 

343.5.1   REQUIRED EQUIPMENT 
When officers are directing traffic, at the scene of a collision, or investigating any incident where 
officers are exposed to vehicular traffic, the following gear is required: 

(a)  Department issued reflective vest at all times; and 

(b)  Flashlight with cone during darkness or limited visibility conditions. 

343.5.2   BARRIERS AND TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES 

(a)  Police units should be used as initial traffic control barriers until a traffic pattern is established 

through the use of arrow boards, cones and/or flares. 

(b)  Flares may be used to assist in traffic movement. 

1. 

Flares used at night or in limited visibility conditions may cause disorientation rather 
than providing direction to drivers. 

(c)  Traffic cones and/or arrow boards should be utilized as additional traffic direction and spaced 

accordingly to give drivers ample time to react. 

1. 

Placing the initial cone pattern and set-up of arrow boards is extremely hazardous 
and should only be done with multiple units to provide adequate protection.

346.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The  public  safety  responsibilities  of  law  enforcement  include  responding  to  crashes  in  order 
to  provide  aid  and  assistance,  document  the  incident,  and  identify  possible  criminal  activity. 
Therefore, officers shall be dispatched to all reported crashes except as noted. 

In  the  event  that  a  city-wide  emergency  or  inclement  weather  creates  an  inordinate  volume  of 
calls for service involving minor crashes, the Watch Lieutenant may authorize patrol to temporarily 
deviate from any portion of this policy.

AFD, tow vehicles). 

(d)     Clearing the crash off of the roadway as soon as possible. 

1. 

If it is not possible to clear the roadway in a reasonable period of time, officers may 
need to manually direct traffic and/or place traffic cones/flares to divert traffic around 
the crash scene. 

346.2.2   REQUIRED SUPPORT NOTIFICATIONS 

(a)  Highway Enforcement 

1.  When on-duty, Highway Enforcement shall assist with traffic incident management 

when a freeway is blocked.

346.4.1   LEAVING THE SCENE & FAILING TO STOP AND RENDER AID 
When a driver leaves the scene of a crash where there is damage to a vehicle without exchanging 
information required by law, it is considered an Leaving The Scene (LTS) crash (Tex. Transp Code 
§ 550.022). When there is very minor damage, officers should determine if a reasonable driver 
would have had knowledge of the damage caused. 

Failing  to  Stop  and  Render  Aid  (FSRA)  crashes  are  LTS  crashes  where  someone  suffers  an 
injury (e.g., complaint of pain or visible injury) as a direct result of the crash (Tex. Transp Code 
§ 550.021).

a supplement; and 

(b)  Take  enforcement  action  if  all  necessary  elements can  be  proven  and  the 

intent to evade responsibility is shown. 

(b)  Enforcement Action 

(a)  Enforcement of an LTS crash is determined by the following: 

(a)  A citation may be issued for a class C misdemeanor if the pecuniary loss is 

less than two hundred dollars ($200). 

(b)  A custody arrest may be made for a class B misdemeanor if the pecuniary 

loss is two hundred dollars ($200) or more. 

(c)  Required Information For Follow-up 

1. 

If  no  enforcement  action  is  made  at  the  scene  of  an  LTS  crash  and  any  of  the 
following criteria is missing, there will not be enough evidence needed to file criminal 
charges. The officer shall notify the victim there will not be a follow-up investigation 
when there is:

Disabled Vehicles and Stranded Motorists 

348.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This  policy  provides  guidelines  to  Department  personnel  to  check  on  and  offer  to  provide 
assistance to disabled or stranded motorist on all roadways within the City of Austin. The safety 
of the vehicle occupants, the officer, and other motorists is the first priority. Removal of vehicles 
posing a hazard or blocking traffic is essential to continuous safe and efficient traffic movement. 

348.2   OFFICER RESPONSIBILITY 
When an on-duty officer observes a disabled vehicle on the roadway, the officer should make a 
reasonable effort to provide assistance. If that officer is assigned to a call of higher priority, the 
dispatcher should be advised of the location of the disabled vehicle and the need for assistance. 
The  dispatcher  should  then  assign  another  available  officer  to  respond  for  assistance  as  soon 
as practicable. 

348.3   EXTENT OF ASSISTANCE 
In most cases, a disabled motorist will require assistance. After arrangements for assistance are 
made,  continued  involvement  by  department  personnel  will  be  contingent  on  the  availability  of 
department resources and the vulnerability of the disabled motorist. 

348.3.1   MECHANICAL REPAIRS 
Department personnel may provide minor mechanical assistance (e.g., change flat tires, provide 
electrical battery boost) to a disabled vehicle. 

348.3.2   PUSH/BUDDY BUMPER USE 
If exigent circumstances exist or with the permission of the vehicle operator, officers may push a 
disabled vehicle out of roadway to a safe location using their push/buddy bumpers. Refer to Policy 
804 (Vehicle Use) on their proper use.

(a) 

(b) 

If the intoxilyzer results indicate the driver's alcohol concentration was at or above the legal 
limit, he shall be charged with DWI. Officers shall follow the appropriate booking guidelines 
outlined in this policy. 

If the intoxilyzer results indicate the driver's alcohol concentration was less than .05 percent, 
it shall be presumed that the person was not under the influence of an alcoholic beverage 
at the time of the alleged offense. 

The  arresting  officer  shall  contact  his  supervisor  or  a  DWI  Enforcement  Unit 
supervisor. 

The  responding  supervisor  shall  review  the  MVR  recording  of  the  initial  stop  and 
subsequent investigation. 

Absent  confirmation  of  the  presence  of  drugs  through  an  examination  by  a  Drug 
Recognition Expert, the responding supervisor shall order the release of the driver 
or direct the officer to issue a citation for the original traffic or other violation. 

(c) 

If  the  intoxilyzer  results  are  .05  but  less  than  .08,  the  arresting  officer  shall  contact  his 
supervisor or a DWI Enforcement Unit supervisor. 

The  responding  supervisor  shall  review  the  MVR  recording  of  the  initial  stop  and 
subsequent investigation. If it is determined that the level of impairment exhibited by 
the driver, and the totality of the circumstances surrounding the arrest still warrant 
the continued detention, the supervisor shall approve the arrest of the driver. 

If the responding supervisor, after review of all the evidence including the intoxilyzer 
results, determines there is insufficient probable cause to support the DWI charge, 
he shall order the release of the driver. 

(d) 

If  the  driver  exhibits  symptoms  of  intoxication  but  the  intoxilyzer  results  do  not  indicate  a 
level of alcohol concentration consistent with the impairment displayed, the driver may be 
asked for a specimen of his blood and if he would consent to a DRE evaluation. If the driver 
was not videotaped during the initial stop, he must be videotaped when the request is made. 

If  the  driver  consents  to  a  DRE  evaluation,  it  shall  be  administered  by  a  trained 
and certified DRE. Based on the outcome of the evaluation, the driver will either be 
booked into jail or released. 

If the driver only consents to a blood specimen, follow the blood specimen guidelines 
outlined in this policy. 

If  the  driver  does  not  consent  to  a  blood  specimen,  even  after  supplying  a  breath 
specimen, seize his Texas drivers license and follow the booking guidelines outlined 
in this policy.

Off-Duty Law Enforcement Actions 

364.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE

employment capacity. 

364.2   POLICY

jurisdiction. 

364.3   FIREARMS 
Officers of this department may carry firearms while off-duty in accordance with federal and state 
law and department policy. 

(a)  Officers  shall  carry  their  Department  issued  badge  and  identification  card  when  carrying 

firearms off-duty. 

(b)  Firearms shall not be carried by any officer who has consumed an amount of an alcoholic 
beverage,  or  taken  any  drugs,  that  would  tend  to  adversely  affect  the  officer's  senses  or 
judgment.

employee is not receiving compensation or benefit as a result of their employment with the

364.4   DECISION TO INTERVENE 
Generally,  off-duty  officers  should  consider  waiting  for  on-duty  uniformed  officers  to  arrive  and 
gather as much accurate intelligence as possible instead of immediately intervening. 

(a)  Officers  should  take  into  consideration  the  following  factors  when  making  a  decision  on 

whether or not to intervene: 

The tactical disadvantage of being alone and the fact there may be multiple or hidden 
suspects. 

The inability to communicate with responding units. 

The lack of equipment, such as handcuffs, OC or baton. 

The lack of cover. 

The potential for increased risk to bystanders if the off-duty officer were to intervene. 

6.  Unfamiliarity with the surroundings. 

The  potential  for  the  off-duty  officer  to  be  misidentified  by  other  peace  officers  or 
members of the public. 

364.4.1   INTERVENTION PROCEDURE 
If involvement is reasonably necessary, an officer should call or have someone else call 9-1-1 to 
request immediate assistance if possible. 

(a)  The  operator  should  be  informed  that  an  off-duty  officer  is  on-scene  and  provided  a 

description of the officer if possible. 

(b)  Officers should clearly identify himself as a police officer to those involved in the situation, 

if practicable. 

(c)  Officers should fully cooperate with the agency having jurisdiction in providing statements 

or reports as requested or as appropriate. 

364.4.2   INCIDENTS OF PERSONAL INTEREST 
Unless there is an exigent circumstance, employees shall refrain from handling police incidents of 
personal interest (e.g., family or neighbor disputes). When practicable, employees should report 
the matter to 9-1-1 so that an on-duty officer can respond. 

(a)  Offenses that may be committed against the employee, members of the employee's family, 
or  a  business  interest  of  the  employee  will  be  reported  to  the  Investigative  Unit  with 
responsibility for investigation of such offenses. Normal filing procedures will be followed to 
prevent any potential for abuse of authority. 

(b)  Employees  shall  not  maintain  continued  involvement  in  any  criminal  case,  nor  personally 
file any criminal charge in a court of law, against any person for criminal offenses committed 
against the employee, any member of the employee's family, or which involves any business 
in which the employee has a proprietary interest.

authorized by State law. 

364.4.4   OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
When  encountering  non-uniformed  officers  in  public,  uniformed  officers  should  wait  for

capability.

Officer Response to Calls 

400.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The  Department  has  a  responsibility  to  protect  life  and  property  and  to  provide  service  to  the 
residents of Austin. To fulfill this obligation it must provide an appropriate response to calls. Officers 
should be ever mindful that they have a responsibility to   use  caution,    good  judgment,  and 
due  care    when operating vehicles in an emergency capacity to ensure the safety of motorists 
and  pedestrians. This  document  describes  the  conditions  under  which an APD  vehicle may  be 
operated as an emergency vehicle. 

400.2   EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND VEHICLE OPERATIONS 

(a)     Officers responding to an emergency call shall do so without delay. 

(b)  Responding  with  emergency  lights  and/or  siren  does  not  relieve  the  operator  of  an 
authorized emergency vehicle of the duty to act as a reasonably prudent emergency vehicle 
operator in like circumstances (Tex. Transp. Code § 546.005). 

(c)  Officers shall exercise sound judgment and care with due regard for life and property when 
responding to an emergency call. Officers shall reduce speed at all street intersections to 
such a degree that they shall have complete control of the vehicle (Tex. Transp. Code § 
546.001). 

(d) 

If  the  emergency  equipment  on  the  vehicle  should  fail  to  operate  at  anytime  during  the 
response, the officer shall notify Communications of the equipment failure so that  another 
unit may be assigned to the emergency response. The officer may still respond to the call 
without the use of emergency equipment. 

(e)     Operation of emergency vehicles is classified in 3 levels: 

1.  Code 3 (Emergency Operation). 

2.  Code 2 (Limited Emergency Operation). 

3.  Code 1 (Routine Operation). 

400.2.1   CODE 3 (EMERGENCY OPERATION) 
Code 3 is used to describe the operation of a vehicle while the emergency lights and siren are 
activated. 

(a)     When operating Code 3, officers may: 

1. 

2. 

Exceed the speed limit but must regulate their speed so as not to endanger life or 
property. 

Proceed  with  caution  through  traffic  signals  and  stop  signs  after  slowing  and,  if 
necessary, stopping to ensure the intersection is safe/clear.

(c)  Officers should only respond Code 3 when so dispatched or when circumstances reasonably 

indicate an emergency response is required. 

1.  Unless  otherwise  required  by  Department  policy  (e.g.,  pursuits),  the  decision  to 

operate Code 3 in authorized situations is at the discretion of the officer 

2. 

If,  in  the  officer's  judgment,  roadway  conditions  or  traffic  congestion  causes  an 
unreasonable  risk  to  operate  Code  3,  the  officer  may  elect  to  respond  to  the  call 
without the use of lights and siren at the legal speed limit. In such an event, the officer 
should immediately notify Communications. 

3.  Officers shall discontinue Code 3 operation when directed to do so by a supervisor. 

(d)  Emergency  Operation  Exemptions.  This  section  does  not  relieve  an  officer  from  the  duty 
to  operate  an  authorized  emergency  vehicle  with  appropriate  regard  for  the  safety  of  all 
persons or the consequences of reckless disregard for the safety of others. 

1.  Officers  may  operate  an  authorized  emergency  vehicle  for  a  law  enforcement 
purpose without using the audible or visual signals if the officer is responding to an 
emergency call or pursuing a suspected violator of the law with probable cause to 
believe that: 

(a)  Knowledge of the presence of the officer will cause the suspect to: 

1.  Destroy or lose evidence of a suspected felony; 

2. 

3. 

4. 

End  a  suspected  continuing  felony  before  the  officer  has  obtained 
sufficient evidence to establish grounds for arrest; or 

Evade apprehension or identification of the suspect or the suspect's 
vehicle; or 

Because of traffic conditions on a multi-lane roadway, vehicles moving 
in response to the audible or visual signals may increase the potential 
for a crash. 

2. 

In operating an authorized emergency vehicle, the officer may: 

(a)  Park or stand; 

(b)  Proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign, after stopping or slowing as 

necessary for safe operation; 

(c)  Exceed a maximum speed limit, as long as the officer does not endanger life 

or property;

Preliminary Field Investigations 

1.  Generally  the  highest  ranking  officer,  or  senior  officer  if  of  the  same  rank,  should 
assume  command  of  the  scene  and  operations  until  relieved  by  a  supervisor, 
or  until  the  conclusion  of  the  incident;  however,  the  highest  ranking  officer  will 
assume command whenever the situation appears to be beyond the control of the 
current officer in charge, when jurisdiction is concurrent over a particular duty, or for 
disciplinary purposes. 

2. 

Any officer may take command of the scene and operations when the current officer 
in  charge  is  unable  to  perform  the  required  duties  because  of  physical  or  mental 
inability. 

3.  Command  at  major  incidents  is  outlined  in  Policy  407  (Emergency  and  Disaster 

Operations). 

(b)  Assumption  of  command  will  be  done  by  the  officer  identifying  himself  and  informing  the 

current officer in charge of his intent to assume command. 

401.3.1   SUPERVISOR ASSUMING COMMAND OF INCIDENTS 
Supervisors  are  not  normally  expected  to  engage  in  law  enforcement  operations  except  in  a 
command  or  supervisory  capacity.  Supervisors  may  be  held  accountable  for  failure  to  take 
command if unfavorable developments occur which could have been prevented had he assumed 
control of the scene. 

(a)  Supervisors will not assume command outside their own organizational segment during the 
normal completion of their responsibilities unless failure to do so would adversely affect the 
Department's operational capability. 

(b)  The ranking supervisor shall assume command of the scene and operations at the scene of 

police incidents involving more than one segment of the Department. 

(c) 

In instances of multiple crimes requiring personnel from more than one Investigative Unit, 
the ranking on-duty supervisor of the most serious offense will assume command (e.g., if a 
homicide occurs in conjunction with a burglary, Homicide Unit would be in command). 

401.4   CRIME SCENE MANAGEMENT 

(a)  Officers arriving at a crime scene are often faced with the immediate need to search for and 
render aid to victims as well as determine if suspects are present and continue to pose a 
threat. 

1. 

Searches   are   limited   to   "plain   view"   in   the   immediate   area   unless   exigent 
circumstances exist (e.g., additional suspects, injured persons). 

2.  Once officers are satisfied that no additional suspects are present and/or there are 

no injured persons to be treated, exigent circumstances will likely no longer exist. 

3.  Officers should secure the scene and conduct no further search until proper authority 

for the search is obtained.

4.  While  consent  to  search  should  be  obtained  from  authorized  individuals  where 
possible, it may be more prudent to obtain a search warrant in the case of serious 
crimes or major investigations. 

(b)  Crime  scene  supervision  is  normally  conducted  by  the  senior  officer  present.  They  have 
the authority to direct and oversee the processing of a scene unless relieved by a senior 
officer  present, Investigative  Unit  personnel  with expertise  in  the  particular crime,  or  by  a 
supervisor. 

(c)  The  primary  officer  or  designee  has  the  following  responsibilities  when  a  crime  scene  is 

present which requires processing: 

Initiate  a  Crime  Scene  Security  Log  (PD0175)  to  record  the  name  and  time  of  all 
persons entering, or assigned to, the crime scene. Upon completion, the form shall 
be given to the primary Investigative Unit. 

Setup an initial perimeter around the crime scene with crime scene tape. The scene 
should be large enough to include potential evidence. 

3.  Determine  if  additional  inner/outer  perimeter(s)  need  to  be  setup.  These  may  be 
used to create a space for media or the public, as a safety measure for officers, or 
to further protect the crime scene from contamination. 

4. 

Protect  items  of  apparent  evidentiary  value  and  ensure  the  scene  is  processed 
accordingly. 

401.4.1   CRIME SCENE PROCESSING AND EVIDENCE COLLECTION 
Employees will ensure that items identified as evidence are not tampered with in any way prior 
to being photographed and collected. 

(a)  Weapons at crime scenes will only be moved if they pose a threat to persons at the scene. 
If the scene has been properly secured, a weapon will not generally pose a threat and can 
be left where it is found. 

(b)  At major crime scenes: 

Employees will only handle evidence at the direction of a supervisor, the investigator 
in charge, or a Crime Scene Unit member at the scene. 

If an employee is requested to handle evidence, employees should be given explicit 
instructions on handling the evidence; employees will document who instructed them 
to handle the evidence and the instructions given. 

(c)  At all other crime scenes: 

If a crime scene technician responds to the scene, the technician will be responsible 
for processing the scene.

401.4.2   LATENT PRINT PROCESSING 
The employee responsible for processing a crime scene will be responsible for ensuring latent 
prints are lifted when prints are necessary (e.g., primary officer, crime scene technician). 

(a)  Latent prints will be obtained at the crime scene; employees will not seize items of physical 

evidence for printing unless: 

1. 

2. 

The  item  is  constructed  such  that  it  cannot  be  printed  at  the  scene  (e.g.,  forgery 
documents); or 

The item has evidentiary value beyond latent prints.

offense number, and location the print was lifted. Print cards will be placed into a collection 
envelope and submitted to an evidence room. 

(c)  Evidence which cannot be fingerprinted by employees at the scene will be recovered and 
wrapped securely in a paper or plastic bag in a manner which will minimize the possibility 
of destroying the fingerprints. 

(d)  Employees  will  not  process  forgery  documents  for  latent  prints  at  the  scene.  Forgery 
documents  will  be  handled  as  outlined  in  Policy  618  (Property  and  Evidence  Collection 
Procedures). 

401.5   SECURE AND IDENTIFY WITNESSES 
Officers should attempt to locate any witnesses to an offense when warranted by the seriousness 
of  the  case.  Since  potential  witnesses to  an  incident  may  be  lost  or the integrity  of  statements 
compromised  with  the  passage  of  time,  officers  should  take  reasonable  steps  to  promptly 
coordinate the following tasks with on-scene personnel: 

(a)  Separate witnesses from the public, media and other subjects on-scene as the situation and 

personnel allow. 

(b)     Obtain necessary identification from witnesses and an account of what they observed. 

1. 

Any  potential  witness  who  is  unwilling  or  unable  to  remain  available  for  a  formal 
interview or who refuses to be identified should not be detained absent reasonable 
suspicion to detain or probable cause to arrest. 

2.  When feasible, a recorded statement should be obtained from witnesses present at 

the time the incident occurred, regardless of whether they actually saw something. 

(c)  Witnesses who are willing to provide a formal interview should be asked to meet at a suitable 
location where an investigator may obtain a recorded statement. Such witnesses, if willing, 
may be transported by Department personnel. 

1. 

A  written,  verbal  or  recorded  statement  of  consent  should  be  obtained  prior  to 
transporting a witness in a Department vehicle. 

2.  When the witness is a minor, consent should be obtained from the parent or guardian, 

if available, prior to transportation. 

(d)     Record witness information and statements in an incident report or supplement.

has completed all necessary steps to secure the property. 

401.7   REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES 

(a)  When the preliminary investigation is done, officers shall prepare an initial incident report 
detailing  an  accurate  record  of  events  as  outlined  in  Policy  402  (Incident  Reporting  and 
Documentation). 

(b)  When  Investigative  or  Specialized  Unit  personnel  (e.g.,  crime  scene  technician,  crash

Incident Reporting and Documentation 

402.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Documentation  is  a  major  part  of  each  officer's  job.  Reports  may  be  used  to  document 
information  to  assist  investigators  in  follow-up  investigations.  Field  release  citations,  warnings, 
field observation (FO) cards and electronic street checks are used to document law enforcement 
actions and/or contacts with the public. Sufficient information should be included in any form of 
documentation to: 

(a)     Assist in prosecution. 

(b)     Refresh an officer's memory during testimony. 

(c)     Comply with legal requirements and Department policy. 

402.1.1   GENERAL GUIDELINES 
An  incident  number  will  be  assigned  and  all  required  fields  completed  during  documentation 
anytime  an  employee  observes  or  receives  any  information  concerning  the  following,  but  not 
limited to: 

(a)  Criminal or suspected criminal offenses, regardless of the victim's level of cooperation. 

(b)  Citizen complaints of non-criminal incidents requiring action by the police. 

(c)     Self-initiated stops 

(d)  When  Crime  Scene  personnel  are  assigned  to  an  incident  that  was  first  initiated  or 

responded to by sworn personnel and no tele-serve report has been made. 

(e)     Crashes involving bicyclists will be will be investigated and reported as defined in Section 
346.3 Crash Investigation.  Non-crash events involving a bicyclist will be documented in a 
Versadex report using title code 4311 under the following circumstances: 

The incident occurred on a public place 

At least one of the involved subjects sustained bodily injury; and 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The  incident  occurred  as  a  result  of  a  potential  criminal  act,  violation  of  the 
Transportation Code, violation of a City Ordinance, or the actions of another party. 

(f)  Any  other  situation  where  documentation  is  required  by  law  or  another  section  of 

departmental policy. 

If  in  doubt  as  to  whether  an  incident  should  be  documented,  employees  shall  confer  with  a 
supervisor. For the purpose of this policy, Corporals may function as the designated supervisor. 

402.1.2   BIAS-BASED DOCUMENTATION GUIDELINES 
Every  member  of  the  Department  is  required  to  document  any  detention,  frisk,  search,  non- 
consensual stop and/or arrest of a subject or vehicle.

The reason for the contact/stop; and 

1. 

2. 

The race and ethnicity of the subject(s) of the contact/stop; and 

3.  Whether the officer knew the race or ethnicity of the subject(s) before conducting

402.2   INCIDENT REPORTING 
A well-written report can help make a case just as easily as a poorly written report can ruin a case. 
Employees have the responsibility to write clear, factual, and complete reports. 

402.2.1   NOTE TAKING 
Good reports can be achieved from accurate notes. Memory alone is not always a reliable method 
upon which to document detailed information. 

(a)  Brief notations concerning specific events and circumstances recorded while fresh on the 

mind will be useful when preparing an incident report. 

(b)  Notes used in court are subject to the scrutiny of the court; employees should ensure they 

are accurate and pertain to the case. 

(c)  Notes should contain the following: 

1.  WHO - Persons involved. 

2.  WHAT  -  Type  of  incident(s),  an  accurate  account  of  what  was  observed,  what 

transpired, and the property/evidence involved. 

3.  WHEN - Date(s), time/s of the incident. 

4.  WHERE - Location(s) of the incident, persons involved during the incident, property 

and evidence involved. 

5.  WHY - What actions taken by persons involved led to the incident(s). 

6.  HOW  -  What  manner,  way,  means,  reason,  purpose,  effect,  extent,  amount,  or

Follow-Up Investigations 

403.3   CASE ASSIGNMENT AND RESPONSIBILITY 
Generally, follow-up investigations shall be the responsibility of the Investigative Unit assigned to 
the case. Report routing to an Investigative Unit is an automated process that is controlled by the 
title code(s) used. Unit ownership of a title code is programmed into the current reporting system 
and updated as needed. 

(a)  With  supervisor  approval,  first  responders  should  conduct  limited  follow-up  investigations 
when  there  is  a  reasonable  chance  of  apprehending  the  suspect,  a  need  for  obtaining 
additional  information  for  the  preliminary  investigation  report,  or  when  there  are  other 
compelling circumstances. 

(b)  Once  a  report  is  routed  to  an  Investigative  Unit,  the  supervisor  or  designee  of  that  Unit 
will assign each case to appropriate employee. The assigned employee will be responsible 
and  accountable  for  any  additional  investigation.  When  assigning  cases,  a  supervisor  or 
designee should: 

Take into account the level of expertise, specialized skill, knowledge and abilities of 
the employee. 

Provide   direction   and   guidance   to   employees   by   periodically   reviewing   their 
supplements and affidavits. 

3.  Record  and  maintain  the  following  information  to  ensure  a  timely  and  complete 

investigation: 

(a) 

Incident number. 

(b)  Personnel assigned. 

(c)  Date assigned. 

(d)  Clearance type. 

(e)  Date cleared. 

(c)  When assigned to a case for follow-up investigation, investigators shall proceed with due 
diligence in evaluating and preparing the case for appropriate clearance or presentation to 
court personnel for the filing of criminal charges. 

(d)  Employees  will  not  participate  in  an  unassigned  investigation,  regardless  of  the  source, 
which is unusual, protracted, or not in the normal course of their duties without the express, 
written approval of their chain-of-command. 

403.3.1   CASE FILES/JACKETS 

(a)     Active cases shall be maintained by the assigned personnel. Case files/jackets shall be:

schedules for law enforcement and Department policy regarding records. 

403.3.2   FELONY CASE MANAGEMENT 
All  felonies  direct  filed  by  an  arresting  officer  require  follow-up  investigation  by  the  appropriate 
Investigative  Unit.  The  assigned  investigator  shall  be  responsible  for  completing  any  further 
investigative steps necessary. 

(a)  Assigned investigators shall prepare a case jacket for the prosecutor's office with copies of 

all paper documents. 

Photographic  evidence  will  be  made  available  through  the  Department's  Digital 
Crime Scene Management System Web Client.

does not need to be copied unless requested by a prosecutorial agency. 

(b)  The case jacket will be forwarded to the prosecutor's office within two (2) weeks of the date 

the individual is booked into jail and an investigator assigned the case. 

The case jacket will contain DA Control Sheet [PD0050 - PD0055] specific to the type 
of crime being investigated to document the evidence contained in the jacket and to 
make notation about any evidence that is pending (e.g., DNA and Print comparison 
results). 

Assigned investigators shall notify their supervisor if the case is not completed within 
the two-week guideline. Supervisors will monitor the progress of the case to ensure 
it is forwarded to the prosecuting agency in a timely manner. 

403.3.3   TITLE CODE RECLASSIFICATION 
Employees shall not delete or change a title code from a Part I UCR crime to a Part II UCR crime 
on any incident report, once the report comes out of report review, without the signed approval 
of the appropriate unit supervisor. 

(a)  This  policy  is  only  intended  to  prevent  serious  Part  I  UCR  crimes  from  being  dropped  to 
a less serious Part II UCR crime without proper review after a report comes out of report 
review. 

(b)     This policy does not prevent title code(s) being changed: 

From one Part I UCR crime to a different Part I UCR crime; or 

From a Part II UCR crime to a Part I UCR crime; or

To  any  UCR  classification,  prior  to  the  report  coming  out  of  report  review  (i.e.  a 
dispatcher may, upon request, correct/update the title code on a dispatched call if 
an officer discovers the incident is different from the original call). 

(c)  Nothing in this policy prevents adding title codes to a report at any time if the investigation 

supports the need for additional title codes. 

(d)     Employees who discovers a Part I UCR crime that needs to be reclassified as a Part II UCR 

crime shall use the following procedure to request a title code change: 

1. 

Employees wanting to reclassify a title code shall do so by submitting the request by 
email to the supervisor over the unit that has ownership of the title code. 

(a)  Employees  who  originate  a  reclassification  request  shall  document  the 
reason(s) for the title code change in a supplement of the incident report and 
include a reference to the title code change in the 'notes' section. 

2.  Upon receiving notice of the title code change request, the unit supervisor will review 
the request and electronically document their agreement or disagreement with the 
request  in  the  "notes"  section.  Title  code  change  requests  approved  by  the  unit 
supervisor must be forwarded to the Central Records Manager for review 

3. 

The   Central   Records   Manager   (CRM)   will   review   all   approved   title   code 
reclassification  requests  and  make  a  ruling  on  whether  the  requested  change  is 
appropriate. The determination shall be based on UCR reporting guidelines for the 
incident reported rather than what state charge could or will be filed. 

(a) 

(b) 

If  the  Central  Records  Manager  agrees  with  the  decision  of  the  unit 
supervisor, the CRM will make the title code change in Versadex. 

If the Central Records Manager does not agree with the decision of the unit 
supervisor,  the  issue  may  be  brought  to  the  commander/manager  of  the 
unit. The commander/manager shall indicate "Approved" or "Denied" in the 
"notes" section. The CRM will then make the change in accordance with the 
commander/manager of the unit's decision. 

403.4   STATEMENTS AND CONFESSIONS 
The purpose or objective of a statement or confession is to take lawful and accurate statements 
that corroborate the elements and details of an incident. In doing so, investigators and supervisors 
will  be  cognizant  of  such  factors  as  the  mental  and  intellectual  abilities  of  the  subject  being 
interviewed  and  the  duration  of  the  interview  itself. Written  and  oral  statements  or  confessions 
should not be utilized as the sole basis for the filing of charges; any statement or confession should 
be corroborated by other legally obtained evidence or verified in an appropriate manner. 

(a)     Whenever possible, employees shall record all interviews and interrogations by audio and/ 

or video.

following by audio/video: 

1.  Reading of the Miranda card to the person in its entirety; and 

2.  Writing the name of the employee reading the rights to the person, the date and time,

403.5.3   SEQUENTIAL LINE-UPS 
An  independent  administrator  will  be  used  for  all  sequential  line-ups  unless  an  extraordinary 
circumstance(s) necessitates using the same officer to both compile and administer the line-up. 
If this occurs, the extraordinary circumstance(s) shall be documented in the incident report. No 
other person should be present during the lineup presentation who knows the suspect's identity. 

(a) 

Independent  administrators  should  avoid  actions  or  statement  that  could  contaminate 
witness  perception  or  judgment.  Be  aware  that  witnesses  may  perceive  such  things  as 
unintentional  voice  inflection  or  prolonged  eye  contact,  in  addition  to  off-hand  words  or 
phrases, as messages regarding their selection. Avoid casual conversation comments such 
as "very good." 

(b)  Photographic or live line-ups will only be conducted when a specific suspect is developed 
during an investigation, or when a suspect has been narrowed down to a specific group of 
individuals. Random suspect line-ups are not permitted. 

(c)  The  Photographic  or  Live  line-up  Instructions  Form  (PD0163)  will  be  used  during  the 
administration of all such line-ups. These forms include a confidence statement which will 
be completed on each administered line-up. 

(d)     If there are multiple witnesses: 

Each   witness   shall   be   given   an   instruction   form   regarding   the   identification 
procedures without other witnesses present. 

The officer will read the instructions aloud to each witness. 

Each witness shall view the line-up separately. 

The suspect will be placed in a different position of the line-up for each witness. 

5.  Witnesses  shall  not  be  allowed  to  confer  with  one  another  until  all  identification 

presentations have been completed and statements taken. 

If the witness declines to sign the instruction form for some reason, then the officer 
will document that the witness was appropriately instructed. 

(e)  The  suspect's  photo  will  be  grouped  with  at  least  five  other  subject  photos  (fillers).  The 
showing of a single photograph for identification purposes is prohibited, unless the subject 
is positively known by the victim and the photograph is shown only to confirm the identity. 

Photos  shall  be  of  similar  characteristics  (i.e.,  hair  color,  length,  facial  hair,  age, 
weight and general appearance). 

Avoid using fillers that so closely resemble the suspect that a person familiar with 
the suspect might find it difficult to distinguish the suspect from the fillers. 

3.  Do not mix color and black and white photographs. All color or all black and white 

photos shall be used. Photo copies are not permitted.

any information concerning such person before the officer obtains the witness' confidence 
statement about the selection. 

(g)  When showing a new suspect, avoid reusing the same fillers in line-ups shown to the same 

witness. 

(h) 

Identification  procedures  will  be  videotaped  whenever  possible.  If  this  is  not  practical,  an 
audio tape of the procedure will be done. If neither is possible, document why recording is 
not available. 

(i)      Document all persons present during the administration of the line-up.

If  the  same  suspect  needs  to  be  shown  to  a  different  witness,  then  the  officer  will  remix 
the lineup. 

403.5.4   FOLDER SHUFFLE METHOD 
There may be unavoidable situations where an independent administration is not possible. If this 
occurs, then the officer will attempt the folder shuffle method of presenting the lineup and attempt a 
blind administration. If emergency circumstances preclude an independent administrator or folder

Emergency and Disaster Operations 

407.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This  policy  establishes  procedures  for  the  initial  response,  assessment,  and  containment  of 
unusual  occurrences  that  result  from  natural  disasters,  man-made  disasters,  acts  of  terrorism, 
and civil disturbances. 

These  unusual  occurrences  are  of  such  magnitude  that  they  may  necessitate  the  recall  of 
personnel and/or the request for support from other agencies in order to maintain Life and Safety, 
Incident Stabilization, Property Conservation, and Societal Restoration (LIPS). 

407.2   INITIAL RESPONSE AND ASSESSMENT 
The first officer arriving on the scene of an incident involving a disaster or major civil disturbance 
will: 

(a)     Immediately notify Communications of the following: 

1.  Nature of the incident. 

Specific details (e.g., exact location, extent of damage, size of the crowd). 

Type of additional assistance required (e.g., AFD, EMS, Specialized Units). 

Establish an initial perimeter (e.g., street or lane closures, initial staging area). 

(b)  Exercise control of the scene until the arrival of a higher ranking officer. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

1. 

If the incident is of such a nature that an officer cannot reasonably assume control, 
he will observe the incident from a safe distance and keep Communications advised 
until additional personnel arrive. 

2.  Upon arrival of sufficient personnel, the highest ranking officer will organize and direct 
those police functions as necessary for the immediate preservation of life, property, 
and order (e.g., traffic control, rescue, first aid) until the arrival of a supervisor. This 
officer should maintain contact with Communications to advise of actions taken and 
incident updates. 

407.2.1   INITIAL SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES 
The first supervisor at the scene will immediately assume command of the operation until relieved 
by higher authority. Supervisors responsibilities include: 

(a)  Making a rapid survey of the scene and estimating the seriousness of the occurrence. 

(b)  Requesting Communications to: 

1.  Clear all normal radio traffic to an alternate channel. 

2. 

Broadcast  citywide  that  all  units  involved  in  the  incident  to  remain  on  initial  radio 
channel.

Communications to establish a secure channel. 

(d)     Determining if immediate evacuation of adjacent areas or structures is needed. 

It is recommended that immediate evacuation be limited to areas within the inner- 
perimeter or other direct line-of-fire areas. 

In  the  event  that  a  widespread  evacuation  is  needed  or  required,  it  should  be 
conducted under ICS protocol. 

(e)     Establishing a temporary Command Post and notifying the affected patrol lieutenant and 

Watch Lieutenant of the following: 

1.  Current status of the situation. 

2.  Number of additional personnel needed.

407.3   COMMAND PROTOCOL AT MAJOR INCIDENTS 
The  first  supervisor  at  the  scene  of  a major  incident  will  immediately  assume  command  of  the 
operation until relieved by higher authority. Long term command protocol at major incidents is as 
follows: 

(a) 

If one or more Specialized Units (e.g., SWAT, Bomb Squad) are needed for the situation, 
the supervisor of the appropriate Specialized Unit will become responsible for the command 
of tactical aspects of the situation when that supervisor arrives on scene. 

(b)  Once  a  Specialized  Unit  supervisor  has  assumed  command  of  tactical  aspects  of  the 
operation,  a  patrol  supervisor  will  maintain  control  of  non-tactical  aspects  (e.g.,  outer 
perimeter maintenance, traffic control).

(c)     Overall control will be assumed by a patrol lieutenant, Specialized Unit lieutenant, or Incident 

Commander (as outlined below) upon arrival. 

407.3.1   INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM 
Certain large-scale incidents requiring multi-agency coordination will adhere to the Austin-Travis 
County  Multi-Agency  Incident  Command  System  (ICS).  When  ICS  is  implemented,  command 
protocol will be as follows: 

(a)     Incident Commander: 

1. 

The Special Operations commander or other on scene commander will serve as the 
Department's overall "Incident Commander." 

2.  Duties of the APD Incident Commander: 

(a)     Work with other agencies at the command post; and 

(b)     Identify and prioritize principle hazards which concern law enforcement; and 

(c)     Ensure that legal responsibilities are upheld; and 

(d)     Develop overall law enforcement objectives; and 

(e)     Give objectives to the APD Operations Chief.

Department resources for an extended period of time. A Command Post may be established by 
the supervisor at the scene for any event or occurrence, regardless of the size of the operation. 

(a)  The  creation  of  a  Command  Post  helps  the  Incident  Commander  on  scene  with  the  vital 
tasks  of  commanding  the  operation,  maintaining  a  system  of  communications,  acquiring 
additional personnel and equipment, accumulating, utilizing and disseminating intelligence 
information, and coordinating efforts with law enforcement and other agencies. 

(b)     The location for a Command Post should be: 

1. 

In the vicinity and strategic to the occurrence; and 

2.  Readily accessible to responding personnel; and

(d) 

It  may  be  necessary  to  establish  a  staging  area  separate  from  the  Command  Post  in 
incidents requiring a large number of personnel or which continue for an extended period of 
time. This allows the command operations to remain free from disruption. The deactivation 
of the staging area is determined by the Incident Commander in charge. 

407.5   UNIFIED TACTICAL RESPONSE PLAN 
The Austin Police Department has prepared a Unified Tactical Response Plan (UTRP) for use by 
all employees in the event of a major disaster, civil disturbance, mass arrest or other emergency 
event.  The  UTRP  provides  for  a  strategic  response  by  all  employees  and  assigns  specific 
responsibilities in the event the plan is activated. 

(a)  The Chief of Police or the highest ranking official on-duty may activate the UTRP in response 

to a major emergency. 

(b) 

In the event the incident has escalated to the degree requiring multiple City Departments 
and resources, the City of Austin will most likely implement the City's Emergency Operations 
Master Plan. 

407.6   ALERT AND MOBILIZATION OF PERSONNEL 
In  certain  circumstances  it  may  be  necessary  for  the  Department  to  deploy  additional  on-duty 
personnel through Mobile Field Force (MFF) or to alert and mobilize off-duty personnel through 
the Mobilization Plan. 

(a)     Mobile Field Force mobilization of on-duty personnel is outlined in Policy 408 (Mobile Field 

Force). 

(b)     Alpha/Bravo mobilization of off-duty personnel is outlined in the UTRP.

408.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Civil disorders may arise from a number of contributing factors and the event may be triggered 
by a single cause or a combination of causes. The Department is dedicated to utilizing the most 
effective techniques and procedures when dealing with civil unrest. 

The initial response to emergency and disaster incidents by patrol officers is outlined in Policy 407 
(Emergency and Disaster Operations). This policy covers the activation and mobilization of on- 
duty personnel to handle civil disorder situations when it has been determined to use the Mobile 
Field Force (MFF) concept. 

408.1.1   MOBILE FIELD FORCE ACTIVATION 
Several different types of scenarios can utilize a MFF. These include planned events, such as a 
rally or protest, as well as spontaneous incidents that exceed normal response capabilities and 
require a MFF response. 

(a)     The activation of a MFF should be considered when dealing with any: 

2.  Disturbance where there is potential for escalation of violence if a large scale show 

(b)     The following personnel have the authority to activate a MFF response: 

1. 

Large scale disturbance; or 

of force is not present. 

1.  Chief of Police. 

2. 

Assistant chiefs. 

3.  Commanders. 

4.  Watch Lieutenant. 

5. 

Patrol and support lieutenants. 

408.2   MOBILE FIELD FORCE CONCEPT 
The Mobile Field Force (MFF) is an organized group of specially trained and disciplined officers 
that can vary in size depending on the scale of the situation. The objectives of the MFF are to 

(a)     Life/Safety. 

(b) 

Incident Stabilization. 

(c)  Property Protection. 

(d)  Societal Restoration.

Mobile Field Force 

408.2.1   MOBILE FIELD FORCE COMPOSITION 

(a)  The  MFF  is  commanded  by  the  on  scene  Incident  Commander  (IC)  and/or  designated 
Operations  Section  Chief(s)  who  are  in  charge  of  the  event  per  ICS  protocol.  IC 
responsibilities include: 

1.  Determining how many officers will respond to form the MFF; and 

2.  Designating the location of a Command Post and rally point. 

(b)  The  Incident  Commander  and/or  Operations  Section  Chief(s)  may  be  assisted  by  a 

lieutenant or sergeant acting as a Deputy or Executive Officer (XO). 

(c)  A MFF squad is usually divided into groups of seven to ten officers and one supervisor. 

(d)  A MFF platoon is composed of four MFF squads. 

A platoon should be commanded by a lieutenant, if available. 

A  preemptive  platoon  will  provide  the  Incident  Commander  with  the  flexibility  to 
conduct offensive operations, if needed, and to make mass arrests. 

408.2.2   MOBILE FIELD FORCE EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES 
The  MFF  will  be  equipped  with  Batons  or  PR24's  (excluding  ASPs),  OC  spray,  less-lethal 
shotguns, and helmets with face shields. 

(a)     Each  Patrol  Region  will  maintain  an  inventory  of  items  necessary  for  the  MFF  (e.g.,  OC 

spray, less-lethal munitions, flex-cuffs). 

(b)  The Patrol Region where the incident occurs will be responsible for resupplying the MFF. 

(c)  When  resupply  is  needed,  the  Incident  Commander  will  have  dispatch  designate  an 
available  Patrol  supervisor  from  the  Region  where  the  incident  occurred  to  deliver  these 
items to the MFF. 

408.3   TRAINING AND PREPAREDNESS 
Being  prepared  for  incidents  of  civil  unrest  can  be  the  key  to  reducing  the  potentially 
catastrophic consequences associated with these incidents. All sworn personnel are responsible 
for maintaining a level of proficiency in MFF training and tactics. 

(a)  Patrol  commanders  shall  ensure  that  all  lieutenants  and  sergeants  under  their  command 
are familiar with the Unified Tactical Response Plan (UTRP) and MFF implementation. 

(b)     Patrol and support lieutenants are responsible for: 

Ensuring that personnel under their command are proficiently trained in MFF tactics, 
procedures, and commands; and 

Verifying  personnel  attend  training  in  MFF  procedures  and  tactics  on  a  regularly 
scheduled basis. 

(c)     Sergeants are responsible for ensuring that members of their squad attend MFF training.

disturbance that could require deployment of an MFF. 

408.4   MOBILE FIELD FORCE RESPONSE 
The number of officers comprising the MFF will depend on the time of day that the MFF is initiated 
and is at the discretion of the Incident Commander. 

(a) 

Initiation of the MFF will be broadcast citywide by dispatch. 

(b)  The MFF activation will utilize a tiered response plan. 

Tier  I  Response  -  This  involves  using  two  designated  officers  from  each  on-duty 
patrol shift to respond to a MFF call up. 

Tier  II  Response  -  This  involves  using  officers  from  the  Highway  Enforcement 
Command  (Motors,  L&W,  and  Highway  Response)  and  can  be  supplemented  by 
additional officers from patrol or other Department units as dictated by the Incident 
Commander. 

(c)  Generally a Tier I Response will be utilized for most situations. At the Incident Commander's 

discretion, a Tier II Response can be utilized. 

(d)  Designated MFF officers will respond to the MFF broadcast. 

(e)  The Incident Commander will make the determination whether MFF officers will respond to 
the scene or to a designated staging area. In some situations, MFF officers may be directed 
to respond directly to the scene to support the on scene officers while others are directed 
to respond to the staging location to form up a MFF response. 

408.5   CONTROL STRATEGIES AND CONSIDERATIONS 
The control strategies employed by the MFF include: 

(a)  Containment. 

(b)  Arrest. 

(c)  Local Emergency Orders.

408.5.1   CONTAINMENT 
After  the  initial  response,  the  next  most  important  control  objective  is  to  contain  the  spread  of 
disorder. Through the use of perimeter control, officers will limit access to the affected area. The 
three basic concepts of perimeter control are linear strategy, cordoning, and sectoring. 

(a)  Linear Strategy - Deploys police as a blocking force along a roadway or geographic barrier 

perpendicular to access routes into the impacted area. 

(b)  Cordoning  -  Surrounds  a  particular  problem  area  by  using  the  linear  strategy  to  seal  off 
access on all sides. These two maneuvers allow the police to prevent outsiders from being 
drawn into the unrest as victims or participants and, at the same time, limit the spread of 
violence from inside the affected area. 

(c)  Sectoring  -  Divides  the  cordoned  area  into  smaller  sized  units.  Order  can  be  restored 
one sector at a time as sufficient police resources are assembled to begin the process of 
regaining control. 

408.5.2   ARRESTS 
During acts of civil disorder, police must act quickly to arrest violators of the law. These arrests 
will help diffuse the unrest while also providing a break in the violence. 

(a)  Arrests must commence from the outset and be made early, quickly, constitutionally, fairly, 

and reasonably. This pattern must be sustained for the duration of the unrest. 

(b) 

If mass arrests occur, the Incident Commander will request prisoner transport vehicles to 
the scene. 

408.5.3   LOCAL EMERGENCY ORDERS 
An   essential    component    of  the  Department's  strategy  for  responding  to  a  civil  disorder  is 
the  issuance  of  emergency  orders.  The  Mayor  has  the  authority  to  issue  and  enforce  rules, 
regulations,  orders,  and  directions  necessary  to  maintain  Life  Safety,  Incident  Stabilization, 
Property Conservation, and Societal Restoration (e.g., establish a curfew). 

408.5.4   EMERGENCY RESPONSE 
A  major  civil  disorder  will  require  the  Department  to  devote  a  large  portion  of  its  resources 
to  restore  order.  When  circumstances  indicate  that  such  a  response  is  required,  the  Incident 
Commander will announce the mobilization of the MFF and will give the location of the assembly 
area.  Once  this  has  been  initiated,  all  specified  personnel  will  respond  to  the  designated 
location. The ranking supervisor will refer to the instructions in the Mobile Field Force Supervisor 
Instructions and Scribe Log (PD0239) and should perform the prescribed tasks.

Swift Water and Flooding Incidents 

409.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The  purpose  of  this  policy  is  to  provide  guidance  and  direction  in  responding  to  a  swift  water/ 
flooding incident. The objective in responding to swift water/flooding incidents is to safely remove 
victims  from  the  danger  of  swift  water  or  flooding  while  keeping  the  safety  of  responders  and 
citizens  at  a  premium.  These  situations  are  inherently  dangerous.  The  possibility  of  a  rescuer 
becoming a victim is ever present and should be considered at all times. 

409.2   EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING 

Device (PFD) and Throw Bag. 

(a)     Each  patrol  vehicle  shall  be  equipped  with  a  Department  approved  Personal  Floatation 

(b)     Each patrol officer shall be trained in the proper use of the PFD and Throw Bag. 

409.3   OFFICER RESPONSE 
Water  rescue  incidents  may  involve  individuals  or  vehicles  trapped  in  swift  water,  water 
evacuations involving individuals stranded by slow moving but rising water, or individuals reported 
under water. Water rescue is normally a technical rescue to be accomplished only by a swift water 
rescue Special Operations Team. 

(a)  Officers should request the AFD Special Operations Team, if not already dispatched. 

(b)  Upon arrival at the scene, officers will: 

1. 

3. 

4. 

Park  the  patrol  unit  out  of  potentially  vulnerable  areas  in  the  event  rising  water 
becomes more widespread. 

2.  Wear their Personal Flotation Device (PFD) at all times at water rescue incidents. 

Keep  personnel  and  citizens  without  PFD's  a  minimum  of  15  feet  away  from  the 
waters edge. 

Assess  the  situation,  victim  status  and  water  conditions  and  continually  update 
Communications. 

409.4   WATER RESCUE GUIDELINES 
A water rescue should not be undertaken unless a victims life is in immediate peril or conditions 
are rapidly deteriorating and it is unlikely that any immediate assistance will be available from a 
swift water rescue Special Operations Team. 

(a)     Officers will only initiate a water rescue after a thorough risk/benefits analysis, including: 

1. 

Life safety issues for both victim(s) and officers; and 

2.  Risks  of  initiating  rescue  operation  versus  delaying  until  arrival  of  trained  Special 

Operations Team resources.

Hazardous Material Response 

410.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Hazardous substances present a potential harm to employees resulting from their exposure. This 
policy outlines the Department's response when dealing with hazardous materials. 

410.1.1   HAZARDOUS MATERIAL DEFINED 
Hazardous  material  -  A  substance  which,  by  its  nature,  containment  and  reactivity,  has  the 
capability  of  inflicting  harm  during  exposure.  It  is  characterized  as  being  toxic,  corrosive, 
flammable,  reactive,  an  irritant  or  strong  sensitizer  and  thereby  poses  a  threat  to  health  when 
improperly managed (Tex. Health and Safety Code § 501.002). 

410.2   HAZARDOUS MATERIAL RESPONSE 
Employees  may  encounter  situations  involving  suspected  hazardous  materials,  such  as  at  the 
scene of a traffic crash, chemical spill or fire. When employees come into contact with a suspected 
hazardous material, certain steps should be taken to protect themselves and citizens. 

The  Austin  Fire  Department  is  the  agency  trained  and  equipped  to  properly  respond  and 
mitigate  most  hazardous  substances  and  biohazards.  In  an  effort  to  increase  efficiency  and 
effectiveness,  AFD  and  APD  will  communicate  and  coordinate  activities  in  accordance  with  an 
Incident Command System. 

Responders entering the area may require decontamination before they are allowed to depart the 
scene  and should  be  evaluated  by  appropriate  technicians  and  medical professionals for  signs 
of exposure. 

The following steps should be considered at any scene involving suspected hazardous materials: 

(a)  Attempt  to  identify  the  type  of  hazardous  substance. Identification may  be  determined  by 

placard, driver's manifest or statements from the person transporting the material. 

(b)  Utilization  of  personal  protective  gear.  If  in  doubt  about  whether  the  use  of  personal 

protective equipment is appropriate, officers should contact on scene Hazmat personnel. 

(c)     Notify the Fire Department. 

(d)     Provide first aid to injured parties if it can be done safely and without contamination. 

(e)  Begin  evacuation  of  the  immediate  area  and  surrounding  areas,  dependent  on  the 
substance.  Voluntary  evacuation  should  be  considered;  however,  depending  on  the 
substance, mandatory evacuation may be necessary. The decision to continue evacuation 
beyond the immediate area or shelter in place should be made after consultation with AFD 
Haz-Mat units. 

(f)  Responders  should  remain  up  hill  and  upwind  of  the  hazard  until  a  zone  of  entry  and  a 

decontamination area is established.

radiation  should  be  conducted  by  trained  APD  officers  or  AFD  Hazmat  personnel  as  soon  as 
possible after an incident. 

410.3   REPORTING EXPOSURE(S) 

(a)  Employees who believe they have been exposed to a hazardous material shall immediately 

report the exposure to a supervisor. 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Supervisors informed of an employee exposed to a hazardous material shall ensure

Each exposure shall be documented by the employee in an employee memorandum 
that shall be forwarded via chain-of-command to the employee's Commander. 

Should the affected employee be unable to document the exposure for any reason, 
it shall be the responsibility of the notified supervisor to complete the memorandum. 

Supervisors shall complete the required Workers' Compensation forms as outlined 
in Policy 956 (On-Duty Injury or Illness).

Hostage, Barricaded, and Suicidal Subject 
Incidents 

412.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Hostage situations and barricaded suspects present unique problems for law enforcement. The 
protection  of  the  public  and  law  enforcement  personnel  is  of  the  utmost  importance.  Proper 
planning  and  training  will  tend  to  reduce  the  risks  involved  with  these  incidents.  The  Critical 
Incident  Negotiation  Team's  (CINT)  sole  purpose  is  to  facilitate  the  professional  resolution  of 
hostage and/or barricaded subject incidents. 

For  purposes  of  this  document,  "professional  resolution"  means  utilizing  nationally  recognized 
law  enforcement  negotiation  techniques  which  focus  on  saving  human  life  during  critical  times 
involving emotionally disturbed persons and/or criminal subjects. Professional resolution further 
means recognizing the importance of safety and inter-unit communication and cooperation with 
regard to the overall success of critical incident resolution. 

412.1.1   DEFINITIONS 
Barricaded  Subject  -  A  person  who  takes  a  position  of  cover  or  concealment  or  maintains  a 
position in a structure and who resists capture by law enforcement personnel. A barricaded subject 
may  be  armed,  suspected  of  being  armed, threatening  violence and/or have demonstrated  the 
potential to commit violence against others or themselves. 

Hostage - A person held by one party in a conflict as security, so that specified terms will be met 
by the opposing party. 

Hostage  Negotiator  -  An  officer  who  has  been  selected,  trained  and  certified  by  the  CINT 
Coordinator. 

"Jumper" Situations - An unarmed suicidal subject who is threatening to jump from an elevated 
position which is capable of causing death. 

Unarmed Suicidal Subject - An unarmed suicidal subject who presents no immediately apparent 
danger to officers or the public. 

412.2   CRITICAL INCIDENT NEGOTIATION TEAM RESPONSE 
The  primary  function  of  the  Austin  Police  Department  Critical  Incident  Negotiation  Team  is  to 
assist  other  members  of  the  Austin  Police  Department  and/or  other  law  enforcement  agencies 
who require assistance with the professional resolution of hostage/barricaded subject situations, 
and unarmed suicidal subjects. 

The  CINT  is  a  direct  support  unit  to  the  SWAT  Team  and  together  comprise  a  component  of 
Special  Operations.  As  such,  the  CINT  is  on  the  SWAT  call-up  trigger  page.  All  requests  for 
hostage negotiators or the CINT are made through the Communications supervisor.

(c)  All Other Unarmed Suicidal Subjects Situations 

1. 

SWAT  and  CINT  will  not  normally  respond  to  any  other  type  of  unarmed  suicidal 
subject.  In  unarmed  suicidal  subject  situations  other than a "jumper,"  officers may 
request a response from crisis intervention officers or the Crisis Intervention Team 
(CIT). 

412.3   FIRST RESPONDER ASSESSMENT 
Nothing in this policy precludes an officer from making a call inside a structure to determine what 
is going on, or to request that a subject come outside to speak with officers. 

The ranking officer may request the assistance of an on-duty hostage negotiator to aid in the initial 
assessment, phone call or verbal contact. 

As soon as it becomes apparent that a hostage/barricaded subject incident or "jumper" situation 
is in progress, officers shall adhere to the notification process outlined in this policy. 

412.3.1   NOTIFICATION PROCESS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

(a) 

If the assessment determines a hostage/barricade situation exists, the first responder shall 
immediately request a supervisor to respond and notify Communications to request a SWAT/ 
CINT response. 

(b) 

If  the  assessment  determines  that  a  "jumper"  situation  exists,  the  ranking  officer  should 
notify Communications to request a CINT-only response. 

(c)  The ranking officer on the scene of an actual or potential hostage/barricade situation shall 

consider the following: 

Avoid confrontation in favor of controlling and containing the situation until the arrival 
of trained personnel and/or trained hostage negotiation personnel. 

Evacuation of bystanders and injured persons. 

Provide responding officers with a safe arrival route to the location. 

Follow    Department    guidelines    for    perimeter    control,    containment,    and 
communications. 

(d)  The  ranking  officer  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  personnel  on  scene  with  pertinent 

information are available to relay it to SWAT/CINT as soon as possible.

Clandestine Lab 

413.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Clandestine laboratory enforcement actions are complicated by the presence of hazardous and/ 
or explosive chemicals. Clandestine laboratories often house substantial quantities of highly toxic, 
corrosive  and  explosive  chemicals  posing  serious  human  health  and  environmental  risks.  To 
ensure that issues concerning health, officer safety, and safety of the environment are properly 
handled, the following procedures will be followed when an employee discovers apparatus they 
suspect may be used to manufacture narcotics. There are strict federal and state guidelines for 
the dismantling, removal, and transporting of clandestine lab chemicals and apparatus. 

413.1.1   CLANDESTINE LAB TEAM 
The Organized Crime Division (OCD) has a certified Clandestine Lab Team (CLT) that is specially 
equipped and trained for the purpose of investigating, dismantling, and transporting clandestine 
laboratories. This team is on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week to respond to clandestine 
labs. 

413.2   CLANDESTINE LABS 
A clandestine lab can be either a cooking lab in the process of producing an illegal drug, or it can 
be a boxed-up or dismantled lab. 

(a)     Clandestine Labs can be found in, but are not limited to, the following places: 

1.  Residential structures (e.g., houses, motel rooms). 

Vehicles, boats, and travel trailers. 

2. 

3. 

Self-storage units. 

4.  Wooded areas. 

(b)  Clandestine  labs  are  dangerous  due  to  the  threat  of  explosion,  fire,  and  chemical 

contamination to officers and civilians who are close to a lab. 

(c)  Except in emergency situations, no employee, other than members of the CLT, will enter 
any room or structure known to contain or reasonably suspected to contain a clandestine 
laboratory. 

(d)  Officers  should  be  aware  that  clandestine  laboratories  may  also  be  established  for  the 
production  of  biological  or  chemical  agents  to  be  used  in  weapons  of  mass  destruction 
(WMD). If a WMD lab is suspected, notification should be made to the APD Bomb Squad 
as well as the CLT. 

413.3   PROCEDURES AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF A LABORATORY OR LABORATORY 
APPARATUS 
Only  certified,  trained  CLT  members  or  an  APD  Chemist  will  be  involved  in  the  dismantling, 
removal and transportation of clandestine lab chemicals and apparatus.

(a)  Officers who discover any item(s), which may resemble a clandestine lab and/or chemicals, 

will notify APD Communications immediately. 

1.  Communications will contact the Fire Department if any clandestine lab, chemical 

spill, or chemical situation presents an immediate threat of fire, 

2.  Communications will immediately notify the on-call CLT sergeant. In the absence of 

the CLT sergeant, the CLT lieutenant will be notified. 

(b)  Officers  will  not  attempt  to  disconnect  any  apparatus,  except  in  extreme  circumstances 
where taking no action would lead to more serious consequence (e.g., fire, explosion). 

(c) 

If  officers  discover  a  clandestine  lab  during  the  course  of  an  investigation  or  arrest,  all 
persons in the house or vehicle should be moved a safe distance from the lab.

Any  suspect(s)  believed  to  have  involvement  should  be  detained  until  the  CLT 
members arrive and debrief the suspect(s). 

2.  Residents in nearby dwellings should be moved to a safe location until the area has 

been declared safe by the CLT supervisor. 

(d)  Officers  will  not  transport  any  chemicals  or  apparatus  in  police  vehicles  unless  directed 

(e)  Officers should never discard or move any chemical substances found unless at the direction 

otherwise by a CLT member.

Bomb threats made at mobile targets such as aircraft, trains, and watercraft. 

Incidents where a suspected or known explosive device is discovered. 

Explosive emergencies. 

All incidents where an explosion has occurred. 

Scenes   where   suspected   explosives   have   been   located   or   recovered   (e.g., 
commercial, military, homemade). 

(b)  The Bomb Squad should NOT normally be utilized in response to bomb threats targeting a 
building, dwelling or fixed structures unless an explosive device is found or circumstances 
warrant it. This includes all fixed structures such as:

414.1.2   USE OF RADIOS/CELLULAR PHONES DURING BOMB RELATED INCIDENTS 
The  use  of  equipment  during  bombing/bomb  threat  response  incidents  that  generate  radio 
frequency  energy  is  a  subjective  matter  that  must  balance  risk  versus  benefit.  The  need 
for  communications  among  responders  can  outweigh  the  risk  of  communication  equipment 
inadvertently  causing  a  detonation  of  an  unknown  explosive  device.  With  this  is  mind  it  is 
permissible to leave radios and cell phones on during a bomb threat search or life saving measures 
at  explosion  scenes,  but  if  a  suspicious  item  is  identified,  do  not  transmit  from  a  position  near 
the item(National Guidelines for Bomb Technicians, Section 8.5, rev 3/10, U.S. Dept of Justice, 
Federal Bureau of Investigation).

Aircraft Crashes 

416.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This policy describes situations involving aircraft crashes, including responsibilities of personnel, 
making proper notification and documentation. 

416.2   RESPONSIBILITIES 
In the event of an aircraft crash, employee responsibilities are as follows: 

416.2.1   OFFICER RESPONSIBILITY 
Officers should treat an aircraft crash site as a crime scene until it is determined that such is not 
the case. If a military aircraft is involved, additional dangers, such as live ordnance or hazardous 
materials, may be present. The scene may require additional security due to the potential presence 
of confidential equipment or information. 

(a)     Officers arriving on scene of an aircraft crash should: 

1.  Determine the nature and extent of the crash. 

2.  Request additional personnel and other resources to respond as needed. 

3. 

Provide assistance for the injured parties until the arrival of EMS, AFD and/or other 
emergency personnel. 

4.  Cordon  off  and  contain  the  area  to  exclude  unauthorized  individuals  as  soon  as 

practicable. 

5. 

Provide crowd control and other assistance until directed otherwise by a supervisor. 

(b)  Entering  an  aircraft  or  tampering  with  parts  or  debris  is  only  permissible  for  the  purpose 
of  removing  injured  or  trapped  occupants,  protecting  the  wreckage  from  further  damage 
or  protecting  the  public  from  danger.  If  possible,  the  investigating  authority  should  first 
be  consulted  before  entering  or  moving  any  aircraft  or  any  crash  debris.  Photographs  or 
sketches of the original positions should be made whenever feasible. 

(c)  The  fire  department  will  be  responsible  for  control  of  the  crash  scene  until  the  injured 
parties  are  cared  for  and  the  crash  scene  has  been  rendered  safe  for  containment. 
Thereafter, police personnel will be responsible for preserving the scene until relieved by 
the investigating authority. 

(d)  Once the scene is relinquished to the investigating authority, personnel from this department 
may assist in containment of the scene until the investigation is completed or assistance is 
no longer needed. 

(e)  An airport service worker or the airport manager may respond to the scene to assist the on- 
scene commander with technical expertise, should it be needed during the operation.

416.2.2   NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD 
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has the primary responsibility for investigating 
crashes involving civil aircraft. In the case of a military aircraft incident, the appropriate branch of 
the military will be involved in the investigation. The NTSB is concerned with several aspects of 
a crash as described in this section. 

Every effort should be made to preserve the scene to the extent possible in the condition in which 
it was found until such time as NTSB or other authorized personnel arrive to take charge of the 
scene. 

Military personnel will respond to take charge of any military aircraft involved, regardless of any 
injury or death. 

If the  crash did not result  in a death  or  injury  and the  NTSB  elects  not  to respond,  the pilot  or 
owner may assume control of the aircraft. 

Removal of the wreckage shall be done under the guidance of the NTSB or military authorities or, 
if the NTSB is not responding for an on-site investigation, at the discretion of the pilot or the owner.

Family Violence 

418.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Family Violence is alleged criminal conduct and it is the policy of the Austin Police Department to 
stress enforcement of criminal laws related to family violence, the protection of the victim and the 
availability of civil remedies and community resources. 

418.1.1   DEFINITIONS 
Dating  Relationship  -  A  relationship  between  individuals  who  have  or  have  had  a  continuing 
relationship of a romantic or intimate nature. A casual acquaintanceship or ordinary fraternization 
in a business or social context does not constitute a dating relationship. The existence of such a 
relationship shall be determined based on consideration of the (Tex. Fam. Code § 71.0021(b & c)): 

(a)     Length of the relationship; and 

(b)     Nature of the relationship; and 

(c)     Frequency and type of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. 

Dating Violence - An act by an individual that is against another individual with whom that person 
has or has had a dating relationship and that is intended to result in physical harm, bodily injury, 
assault or sexual assault or that is a threat that reasonably places the individual in fear of imminent 
physical harm, bodily injury, assault or sexual assault. However, dating violence does not include 
actions taken in self defense. (Tex. Fam. Code § 71.0021). 

Family  -  Individuals  who  are  related  either  by  blood  or  by  marriage.  Family  includes  former 
spouses, parents of the same child regardless of the marital status or the legitimacy of the child 
and foster child/parent relationships (Tex. Fam. Code § 71.003). 

Family Violence - An act by a member of a family or household against another member of the 
family  or  household  that  is  intended  to  result  in  physical  harm,  bodily  injury,  assault  or  sexual 
assault or that is a threat that reasonably places the member in fear of imminent physical harm, 
bodily injury, assault or sexual assault. However, family violence does not include actions taken 
in self defense (Tex. Fam. Code § 71.004). 

•        Family violence also includes the term dating violence (Tex. Fam. Code § 71.004). 

Household - A unit composed of persons living together in the same dwelling, without regard to 
whether they are related to each other (Tex. Fam. Code § 71.005). 

Member  of  a  household  - Includes a person who previously lived in a household. (Tex. Fam. 
Code § 71.006). 

Primary  Aggressor - The person who appears to be the most significant aggressor rather than 
the first aggressor. In identifying the primary aggressor an officer shall consider: 

(a)  The intent of the law to protect victims of family violence from continuing abuse. 

(b)  The threats creating fear of physical injury.

418.2   ENFORCEMENT GUIDELINES 
The primary duties of an officer who investigates a family violence allegation, or who responds 
to a disturbance call that may involve family violence, are to protect any potential victim of family 
violence and enforce the law by making lawful arrests of violators. 

Officers making an arrest for any incident involving family violence shall direct file all charges as 
outlined in Policy 323 (Booking and Arrest Review), unless directed otherwise by the appropriate 
investigator. 

418.2.1   ARREST REQUIREMENT FOR ASSAULTIVE OFFENSES 

(a)     Officers are required to make an arrest for incidents involving family violence when: 

An assault has occurred that resulted in a minimum of bodily injury or complaint of 
pain; and 

The suspect is still on-scene; and 

The assault meets the definition of "family violence" or "dating violence." 

(b) 

If  both  parties  have  been  assaulted,  officers  shall  make  reasonable  efforts  to  identify  the 
primary aggressor. Arrests of both parties should be avoided unless warranted. 

If  officers  at  the  scene  cannot  determine  the  primary  aggressor,  an  on-duty 
supervisor shall be contacted to make the determination. 

If  the  on-duty  supervisor  cannot  determine  the  primary  aggressor  and  there  is 
adequate and articulable probable cause to believe that each person contributed to 
the violence, supervisors may authorize officers to make multiple arrests. 

(a)  Officers shall write probable cause affidavits for each of the arrests and direct 

file the charges. 

(b)  The  name  of the  supervisor  authorizing  a multiple  arrest  situation  shall  be 

included in the incident report. 

(c)  Officers shall not use mediation at the scene as a substitute for appropriate reporting and 

enforcement action when physical violence has taken place. 

(d)  Officers shall arrest for assault by threat or assault by contact if no physical violence has 
occurred but circumstances reasonably show further violence is likely to happen. Supervisor 
approval is required when the arrest is made from inside a residence. 

(e)  Supervisors may authorize an exception to an arrest if there are articulable facts that lead 
a reasonable  person to believe  the  alleged suspect  was acting in  self-defense. The facts 
leading  to  the  decision  for  an  exception  shall  be  fully  documented  in  the  incident  report, 
along with the name of the supervisor approving the exception.

(b) 

It is recommended that a suspect in a family violence offense only be placed in protective 
custody  pursuant  to  a  POEC  when  sufficient  psychiatric  bed  space  is  available  and  has 
been confirmed at the proper psychiatric facility by the CIT officer prior to transport. Under 
no condition will a suspect in protective custody pursuant to a POEC be transported to a 
hospital ER for a family violence offense when no psychiatric beds are available in lieu of 
filing criminal charges. 

(c) 

If  the  CIT  officer  determines  the  subject  fits  the  criteria  for  a  POEC,  the  CIT  officer  may 
transport the subject to a psychiatric facility on the POEC. 

1.  Once at the facility, the CIT officer will remain with the subject pending the physician's 

evaluation. 

(a) 

(b) 

If  the  facility  admits  the  subject,  the  CIT  officer  shall  complete  all  required 
family  violence  documentation  but  will  not  file  any  charges  on  the  subject. 
Additional charges may be filed at a later time. 

If the facility does not admit the subject, the CIT officer will place the subject 
under  arrest  for  the  family  violence  criminal  offenses(s)  committed.  Once 
arrested, the CIT officer shall complete all documentation and use direct file 
procedures for the filing of charges at the time of booking. 

(d)     This section does not: 

(a)  Remove the requirement to complete an Assault Victim Statement (AVS) and make 

any applicable notifications as outlined in this policy. 

(b)  Supersede  an  officer's  authority  to  arrest  for  a  felony  offense  at  the  scene  in 

accordance with Department policy.

the potential for serious injury is likely, shall contact their supervisor prior to 
making an arrest. 

(b)  Supervisors   shall   contact   the   appropriate   Investigative   Unit   prior   to

(a)  While  in  most  cases  there  is  evidence  of  both  external  and  internal  injury  to  the  neck, 
many times there are no visible injuries. In those instances, an internal injury may still have 
occurred that can result in death. Victim may not understand the danger of their injuries and 
may be reluctant to seek medical attention. 

1.  Call EMS to the scene to evaluate the victim even if the victim doesn't want them.

Protective Orders 

(e)  Valid out-of-state and tribal court protective orders (Tex. Fam. Code § 88.004). 

419.3.1   VERIFICATION OF ORDER 
Whenever a complainant advises of the existence of a protective order, officers shall immediately 
attempt to determine the following: 

(a) 

If a protective order exists through the following means: 

The  complainant  has  a  certified  or  official  court  copy  of  a  protective  order  in  his 
possession. 

A protective order is on file via NCIC, TCIC, or APD Central Records. Temporary ex- 
parte orders are not entered into TCIC or NCIC and can only be verified by checking 
through APD Central Records. 

(b) 

If the protective order is valid by checking the termination or expiration date of the order, or 
whether the order has been vacated by the court. 

Temporary  ex-parte  orders  must  have  been  served  prior  to  enforcement  action  in 
order for them to be valid. Service of temporary ex-parte orders can only be verified 
by checking through APD Central Records. 

(c) 

If a violation of the protective order has occurred by checking: 

The terms of the protective order; and 

The location of the protected address. 

1. 

2. 

1. 

1. 

2. 

(a)  Some orders specify the applicant's county of residence rather than a specific 
street address. This attempt by the court to further protect the applicant does 
not invalidate the order's protection of the residence address. In these cases, 
if a residence appears to be the applicant's home, it shall be considered the 
protected address and the order will be enforced accordingly. 

(d)  Determining the validity of a court order, particularly an order from another jurisdiction, can 
be challenging. Therefore, in determining whether there is probable cause to make an arrest 
for a violation of any court order, officers should utilize all reasonably available resources 
to confirm the validity of the order. 

419.3.2   ARREST GUIDELINES 
Officers  must  carefully  read  a  protective  order  prior  to  taking  enforcement  action  to  verify  the 
details of the prohibited conduct and that the order is still in effect. 

(a)  No person can grant the subject of a protective order permission to violate any tenet of the 

order, including a law enforcement officer or the victim. 

(b)  The protected person cannot be arrested for personally violating any tenet of the order. 

(c) 

If it is found that a person has violated a court order, the following arrest guidelines apply:

Sexual Assault 

420.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This policy will establish a procedure by which officers shall investigate and report sexual assault 
related crimes. 

420.2   INVESTIGATION CONSIDERATIONS 

420.2.1   INITIAL INTERVIEW WITH THE VICTIM 
Officers shall adhere to the following guidelines when conducting an initial interview of a victim 
involved in a sexual assault. 

(a)  The physical well-being of the victim takes precedence in the initial response by officers. If 

the victim requires medical attention, the officer will summon EMS to the scene. 

(b)  Officers shall contact a Victim Services Unit. 

(c)  Officers shall conduct the interview of the victim with dignity and respect, being mindful that 

the victim has experienced a traumatic event. 

1.  Officers should make every attempt to maintain the victim's privacy and protect the 

integrity of the investigation. 

2.  Officers should not interview a victim 12 years of age or younger; these interviews 
shall be done by an investigator from the appropriate Investigative Unit. However, 
if the victim made an "outcry" statement to an adult, the officer should identify and 
interview the adult, if possible. 

3.  Officers  will  not  ask  a  victim  if  they  want  to  prosecute  (the  suspect  /  crime);  this 

inquiry is premature. 

(d)  Officers  shall  provide  the  victim  with  the  information  outlined  in  this  policy  on  the  SAFE 
(Sexual Assault Forensic Exam). If the victim consents to the exam, approval shall be at the 
discretion of the Sex Crimes investigator. 

(e)  Once  a  determination  is  made  that  a  sexual  assault  has  occurred,  officers  shall  contact 
the on-call Sex Crimes investigator and fully brief him on the incident. The investigator will 
determine if there is a need to respond to the scene. 

(f)  Officers  should  contact a  Crime  Scene  Unit  when  a  crime  scene  or  evidence  is  present. 
Officers  should  be  mindful  that  there  are  multiple  crime  scenes  in  a  majority  of  sexual 
assaults; the victim, the suspect and the actual scene itself. 

420.2.2   INVESTIGATIVE UNIT RESPONSIBILITY 
When conducting a preliminary investigation of an alleged sexual assault, officers shall contact 
the appropriate Investigative Unit for assistance: 

(a)  Child Abuse Unit - If the victim is 16 years of age or younger.

(b)  Sex Crimes Unit - If the victim is 17 years of age or older. 

420.3   SEXUAL ASSAULT FORENSIC EXAM INFORMATION 

(a)  Officers  will  explain  the  following  information  to  the  victim  concerning  the  Sexual  Assault 
Forensic Examination (SAFE) to allow them to make an informed decision about having the 
exam conducted. 

1. 

2. 

A SAFE is not mandatory, but is strongly recommended. 

The  SAFE  provides  medical  attention  necessary  for  emergency  and  preventative 
treatment. Additionally, the examination allows for the collection and documentation 
of valuable forensic evidence. 

3.  Charges  for  the  SAFE  shall  be  paid  for  by  the  City  of  Austin  and  not  billed  to  the 

victim. However, all other charges shall be the responsibility of the victim. 

4.  Officers should suggest that victims bring a change of clothing to the hospital if they 
are wearing the clothing they had on during the assault. Officers should explain that 
the  clothing  worn  during  the  assault  will  be  collected  by  the  nurse  for  evidentiary 
purposes. 

5.  Whether or not a victim has bathed, showered, or douched does not preclude the 

exam from being conducted. 

6. 

If the victim needs to urinate prior to the start of the SAFE, officers should obtain a 
sterile container from hospital personnel and give it to the victim so the victim's urine 
can be collected and preserved as evidence. 

(b)  Officers  should  determine  if the  victim,  a  person authorized  to  act  on  behalf  of  the  victim 
or  an  employee  of the Department  of  Family  and Protective  Services,  will  consent  to the 
forensic examination, as appropriate (Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. art. 56.06). If the consent is 
given, officers shall request authorization from the appropriate Investigative Unit. 

(c)  Generally, exams shall be approved if the incident occurred within 120 hours. However, if 
a sexual assault is not reported within 120 hours, the Investigative Unit may still authorize 
a medical examination. 

420.3.1   PREFERRED HOSPITAL FOR FORENSIC EXAM 
The  gender  and  age  of  the  victim  shall  determine  the  preferred  hospital  for  the  examination. 
However, the victim may choose a particular hospital as long as it is within the city limits of Austin. 

(a)  The preferred hospitals are: 

1. 

St. David's Hospital 

(a)  Any adult victim. 

(b)  Males who are 12 and older. 

(c)  Females who have started their menstrual cycle.

is to ensure the SANE (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner) is contacted and can respond to 
the hospital in a timely manner. 

420.3.2   CLOTHING COLLECTION AS FORENSIC EVIDENCE 

(a)  Officers should attempt to gather clothing worn by victims during the time the sexual assault 
occurred for evidentiary purposes when victims do not consent to a forensic exam or are no 
longer wearing the clothing they were wearing at the time the sexual assault occurred. 

(b)  Proper handling of evidence can be found in Policy 618 (Property and Evidence Collection 

Procedures).

caretaker,  family  member,  or  other  individual  who  has  an  ongoing  relationship  with  the 
person. 

Exploitation  -  The  illegal  or  improper  act  or  process  of  a  caretaker,  family  member  or  other

Elder Abuse 

422.3   MANDATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
The  Austin  Police  Department  is  considered  a  mandated  reporter.  If  during  the  course  of  an 
investigation an officer has cause to believe that the elderly or disabled person has been abused, 
neglected or exploited by another person in a manner that constitutes a criminal offense under 
any law, the officer shall take a report and notify the appropriate state agency (Tex. Hum. Res. 
Code § 48.051). 

422.4   OFFICER'S RESPONSE 
All incidents involving actual or suspected elder and dependent abuse shall be fully investigated 
and appropriately documented. 

422.4.1   INITIAL RESPONSE 
Officers  may  be  called  upon  to  make  a  forced  entry  as  the  first  responders  to  the  scene  of  a 
suspected elder abuse case. Entry should be immediate when it appears reasonably necessary to 
protect life or property. When the need for an emergency entry is not evident, officers should seek 
supervisory approval. Officers must be prepared to provide emergency care pending the arrival 
of medical personnel, if medical personnel not already present. 

422.4.2   STABILIZE THE SITUATION 
Officers must quickly assess the situation to ensure the immediate safety of all persons. Officers 
shall also consider the following: 

(a)  Attempt to identify the victim, suspect and witnesses as well as the roles and relationships 
of  all  parties.  Parties  should  be  interviewed  separately  when  possible.  Frequently  it  is 
wrongfully assumed that elderly persons are incapable of accurately reporting the incident. 
Do not automatically discount the statement of an elderly person. 

(b)  Preserve the crime scene where evidence may be present. All persons should be removed 
from  the  scene  until  it  has  been  photographed  and  processed.  Any  evidence  that  may 
change in appearance, such as injuries, should be photographed immediately. 

(c)  Assess  and  define  the  nature  of  the  problem.  Officers  should  assess  the  available 
information to determine the type(s) of abuse that may have taken place or the potential for 
abuse in the future that may be eliminated by law enforcement intervention. 

(d)  Make on-scene arrests when appropriate. Immediate arrest of an abuser (especially when 
the abuser is a family member or caretaker) may leave the elderly victim without necessary 
support and could result in institutionalization. The effect of an arrest on the victim should 
be considered and weighed against the assessed risk and the competent victim's desires. 
The present and future safety of the victim is of utmost importance. 

422.4.3   SUPPORT PERSONNEL 
The following person(s) should be considered if it appears an in-depth investigation is appropriate: 

(a)     Patrol supervisor.

threat of abuse (other than financial abuse alone), the officer may contact Adult Protective Services 
and request that they obtain a protective order against the person alleged to have committed or 
threatened such abuse if that person is not in custody. 

Refer  to  Policy  418  (Family  Violence)  for  guidelines  on  filing  an  EPO  on  any  incident  where  a 
suspect is arrested and it is clear there has been family violence against an elder or dependent 
adult. 

422.5   ELDER ABUSE REPORTING 
Every allegation of elder abuse shall be documented. When documenting elder/dependent abuse 
cases, the following information should be included in the report:

that  may  warrant  an  expedited  investigation/prosecution  or  the  preservation  of  testimony 
under Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. art. 39.025 

Reporting  of  cases  of  elder/dependent  abuse  is  confidential  and  will  only  be  released  in

ensure the minor is delivered to the appropriate child welfare authority. 

An officer may take possession of a child without a court order on the voluntary delivery of the child 
by the parent, managing conservator, possessory conservator, guardian, caretaker or custodian

426.4   AMBER AND SILVER ALERTS 

426.4.1   AMBER ALERT 
AMBER™ Alert is the recruitment of public assistance to locate an abducted child via a widespread 
media alert. Utilizing the assistance of local radio, television and press affiliates, the public will be 
notified of the circumstances of a child's abduction and how they can assist law enforcement in 
the child's recovery. The goal of the AMBER Alert program is the safe return of an abducted child 
by establishing an effective partnership between the community, the media and law enforcement 
(37 Tex. Admin. Code § 9.21). 

(a)     Abducted Child 

1. 

A  child  17  years  of  age  or  younger  whose  whereabouts  are  unknown  and  whose 
disappearance  poses  a  credible  threat  to  the  safety  and  health  of  the  child,  as 
determined by a local law enforcement agency (Tex. Gov't Code § 411.351(1)). 

2. 

Abduction includes a child who is younger than 14 years of age who departed: 

(a)  Willingly with someone who is more than three years older than the child; and 

(b)  Without the parent or legal guardian's permission; and 

(c)  With  a  person  who  is  not  an  immediate  relative  of  the  child  as  defined  by 

Subchapter B, Chapter 573, Tex. Gov't. Code. 

(b)     An AMBER Alert can only be implemented if  all  of the following criteria are met (Tex. Gov't 

Code § 411.355 and Tex. Gov't Code § 411.356): 

(a)  There is reason to believe that a child 17 years of age or younger has been abducted; 

and 

(b) 

It is believed that the abducted child is in immediate danger of serious bodily injury 
or death or of becoming the victim of a sexual assault; and 

(c)  A preliminary investigation has taken place that verifies the abduction and eliminates 

alternative explanations for the child's disappearance; and

426.4.2   SILVER ALERT 
The Silver Alert Network was developed as a statewide emergency response system for certain 
missing senior citizens. The network is designed to be activated when missing senior citizens with 
a diagnosed impaired mental condition poses a credible threat to their health and safety (37 Tex. 
Admin. Code § 9.31(a)). 

(a)     Definitions 

1.  Diagnosed  Impaired  Mental  Condition  -  A  mental  condition  or  disorder  as 
defined  by  the  current  version  of  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  as  a 
clinically  significant  behavioral  or  psychological  syndrome  or  pattern  that  occurs 
in  an  individual  and  that  is  associated  with  present  distress  or  disability  or  with  a 
significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability or an important loss of 
freedom. In addition, this individual's current condition presents a level of impairment 
significant enough to pose a credible threat to the individual's health and safety. The 
condition, e.g., Alzheimer's disease or dementia, shall be documented by a medical 
or mental health professional (37 Tex. Admin. Code § 9.31(b)). 

Senior  Citizen  -  A  person  who  is  65  years  of  age  or  older  (Tex.  Gov't  Code  § 
411.381(3)). 

(b)     The Department may issue a Silver Alert if (Tex. Gov't Code § 411.386): 

The person reported missing is 65 years of age or older. 

The senior citizen's location is unknown. 

The senior citizen's domicile is in Texas. 

The senior citizen has an impaired mental condition. 

It is determined that the senior citizen's disappearance poses a credible threat to the 
senior citizen's health and safety. 

The Silver Alert request is made within 72 hours of the senior citizen's disappearance. 

There is sufficient information available to disseminate to the public that could assist 
in locating the senior citizen. 

426.4.3   ALERT PROCEDURES 
In the event of a confirmed missing person that meets the criteria for an AMBER or Silver Alert, 
the following procedure shall be followed:

Exigent Mobile Phone Ping Requests 

427.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Case law has determined that pinging a mobile phone is the equivalent of conducting a search; 
therefore,  probable  cause  must  exist  prior  to  obtaining  ping  results.  A  court  order,  signed 
by  a  district  judge,  must  be  obtained  prior  to  pinging  a  mobile  phone,  except  under  exigent 
circumstances. This policy outlines the procedure for officers wishing to use a mobile phone ping 
in emergency (exigent) situations. 

427.2   EXIGENT MOBILE PHONE PING REQUESTS 
Some examples of incidents that may qualify for an exigent mobile phone ping are: 

(a)  Active kidnappings. 

(b)     Missing or suicidal subjects who threaten another person with death or exposes another 
person  to  substantial  risk  of  serious  bodily  injury.   Attempted  suicide  or  threat  of  suicide 
alone does not meet the exigency requirement established by the CCP.  Officers must be 
able to articulate that a criminal offense has occurred or will occur, and that an “immediate 
life threatening situation” exists.  The CCP defines an “immediate life threatening situation” 
as threatening another with death, or exposing another to serious bodily injury. 

(c)  Aggravated Crime Sprees within a short amount of time (e.g., multiple robberies involving 

shootings within an hour of each other). 

427.2.1   EXIGENCY REQUIREMENTS 
Officers  requesting  a  mobile  phone  ping  in  emergency  situations  shall  adhere  to  the  following 
guidelines. Exigent mobile phone ping request must meet all of the following requirements: 

(a)     An immediate threat of serious injury or loss of life of another person; and 

(b)     Reason to believe a criminal offense is, or will be, involved; and 

(c)     There is no time to obtain a court order; and 

(d)  Belief that the phone number is subscribed to or is in possession of the suspect or victim 

and/or is likely to determine the location of the suspect or victim; and 

(e)  Other  means  to  locate  suspect  have  been  attempted  and  were  unsuccessful  and/or 
employing other means would create a substantial risk of serious injury or loss of life to the 
officer or another if attempted. 

427.2.2   REQUESTING AN EXIGENT MOBILE PHONE PING 
Officers shall contact their supervisor when requesting an exigent mobile phone ping that: 

(a)  has originated from a non-911 source and 

(b)     meets all the exigency requirements:

if the request shall be approved. 

3.  Once approved, the Watch Lieutenant shall assist with completing and, if necessary, 

signing the Exigent Request form to be sent to the cell phone provider. 

The Watch Lieutenant will scan the faxed exigent request document and e-mail it to 
assigned investigating detective who will be responsible for having it placed in the 
case jacket. 

Personnel from the Real Time Crime Center (RTCC) may assist with the logistics of 
locating the phone, and relaying the location information to involved units. 

427.2.3   DOCUMENTATION 

(a)  The  officer  originally  requesting  the  cell  phone  ping  shall  ensure  that  a  detailed  offense 
report outlining the facts and circumstances that gave probable cause to ping the phone is 
completed in Versadex prior to the end of their tour of duty. 

(b)  A copy of the list of APD Police Officers authorized to declare exigent circumstances will be 

maintained in the Real Time Crime Center.

Death Investigations 

434.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The investigation of cases involving death includes those ranging from natural causes to homicide. 
Some causes of death may not be readily apparent and some cases differ substantially from what 
they  appeared  to  be  initially.  The  thoroughness  of  death  investigations  cannot  be  emphasized 
enough. 

434.2   INVESTIGATION CONSIDERATIONS 
Death investigation cases require certain actions be taken. Officers responding to the scene of a 
death incident shall adhere to the following guidelines: 

(a)  Paramedics shall be called in all suspected death cases unless the death is obvious (e.g., 

decapitated, decomposed). Officers are not authorized to pronounce death. 

(b)     A supervisor shall be notified in all death investigations. 

(c)     Gather as much information regarding the incident and deceased as possible. 

1. 

2.

2. 

Identify  the  name,  DOB,  address  and  social  security  number  of  the  deceased,  if 
possible. 

Identify  the  attending  physician  and  whether  he  will  sign  the  death  certificate,  if 
applicable. 

Identify  any  witness(es)  to  the  incident.  Attempt  to  detain  witness(es)  until  the 
Homicide Unit determines if any witnesses need to be interviewed. 

(d)  Notify the Homicide Unit to determine if the death is reportable and whether an investigator 

from the Homicide Unit will respond. 

(e)     Establish a perimeter for suspicious deaths/homicides or as necessary. 

(f) 

Initiate a Crime Scene Log for suspicious deaths/homicides, or as necessary, to include a 
list of all persons who enter the crime scene and their purpose for doing so. 

(g)  Contact  the  Travis  County  Medical  Examiners  Office  and  advise  the  investigator  of  the 

circumstances of the death and the deceased persons information. 

The investigator shall notify the officer of who will sign the death certificate and who 
the deceased will be released to. 

If the deceased can be released to a funeral home, ensure the requested funeral 
home is notified. 

(h)     Remain at the scene until the deceased has been removed by personnel from the Medical

Death Investigations 

434.2.1   SEARCHING DEAD BODIES 
The Medical Examiner is generally the only person permitted to search a body that is known to be 
dead. The only exception is that an officer is permitted to search the body of a person killed in a 
traffic collision for the limited purpose of locating an anatomical donor card. If such a donor card is 
located, the Medical Examiner shall be promptly notified.  Should exigent circumstances indicate 
to an officer that any search of a known dead body is warranted prior to the arrival of the Medical 
Examiner, the investigating officer shall first obtain verbal consent from the Medical Examiner. 

Whenever possible, a witness, preferably a relative to the deceased or a member of the household, 
should  be  requested  to  remain  at  the  scene  with  the  officer  pending  the  arrival  of  the  Medical 
Examiner. The name and address of this person shall be included in the narrative of the death 
report. The handling officer should obtain a receipt from the Medical Examiner whenever personal 
effects are removed from the body of the deceased. This receipt shall be attached to the death 
report. 

434.3   REPORTABLE AND NON-REPORTABLE NATURAL DEATHS 
Officers should assume that an apparent natural death is reportable until the officer can determine 
that all qualifications for a non-reportable natural death are met and approved by the Homicide 
Unit.  Officers  shall  always  initiate  a  report  entitled  "Deceased  Person"  when  responding  to  a 
reportable natural death. 

(a)     Reportable Natural Death 

1. 

A reportable death is a death that requires a law enforcement agency or a medical 
examiner to be notified and an incident report to be written. 

(a)  Any death at a private residence is a reportable death unless the death meets 

the requirements of a "hospice death" as explained below. 

(b)  Any death of a child 17 and under is a reportable death and investigated by 
the Homicide Unit and reviewed by the Travis County Child Fatality Review 
Team. 

(b)     Nursing Home Death 

(a)  An apparent natural death at a nursing home is not always reportable; nursing homes 
are considered 24 hour health care facilities. A death that occurs at a nursing home 
is reportable if it meets any of the conditions set forth in the Texas Code of Criminal 
Procedure (Art. 49.25, Sec 6 (a)). 

(b)  An apparent natural death that occurs at an Assisted Living facility is considered an 

at home death and shall be reported. 

(c)     Hospice Death 

death. 

(a)  An apparent natural death at a qualified Hospice facility is not considered a reportable

Death Investigations 

(b)  Although a private residence hospice death is a reportable death, by agreement with 
the Travis County Medical Examiner's office, the responding officer does not need 
to initiate an incident report. A private residence hospice death is one that meets the 
following criteria: 

(a)  The deceased has been diagnosed by an attending physician as having a 

terminal illness with no expectation of cure. 

(b)  A  "Directive  to  Physicians"  has  been  signed  and  witnessed  in  accordance 

with the "Texas Natural Death Act". 

(c)  A registered nurse is present at the home at the time the death, or shortly 

thereafter, to assess the condition of the deceased. 

(d)  The nurse notifies the attending physician immediately of the death. 

(e)  The attending physician states a willingness to sign the death certificate. 

(f) 

The  attending  physician  notifies  the  appropriate  funeral  home  to  have  the 
deceased removed from the residence. 

434.4   DEATH NOTIFICATION 
It  is  normally  the responsibility  of  the  Medical  Examiner's Office  to make death  notifications to 
the next-of-kin. 

(a)  At the Medical Examiners' request and when practicable, notification to the next-of-kin may 

be made by the Victim Services Unit or investigative personnel. 

(b) 

If  the  next-of-kin  lives  in  another  jurisdiction,  the  law  enforcement  agency  from  that 
jurisdiction shall be requested to make the notification. 

434.5   REPORTING GUIDELINES 
Officers shall include the following information when an incident report is required: 

(a)  Deceased persons information (e.g., name, DOB, race, sex). 

(b)  How the body was discovered and by whom. 

(c)  A description of the body and scene as it was found at the officers arrival. 

(d)  Any alterations to the body or the scene made by the officer or any other person (e.g., EMS, 

AFD). 

(e)  Time of death. 

(f)  Name of physician who will sign the death certificate. 

(g)  Name of witnesses.

An Unauthorized Use of a Motor Vehicle (UUMV) occurs when a complainant has allowed another 
person to use their vehicle and the person has not returned it. Officers responding to a possible 
stolen vehicle incident need to determine if the complainant is aware of who is in possession of 
the vehicle and if the person had been given permission to use the vehicle at one point.This is a 
matter of current or prior permission to use the vehicle, not a matter of familiarity with the suspect. 

(a)     Officers responding to a UUMV incident shall take the following steps: 

(a)  Determine if the vehicle has been impounded or repossessed by running the license 

plate and/or VIN.

Policy Manual 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Identity Theft 

436.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Identity theft is a growing trend that frequently involves related crimes in multiple jurisdictions. This 
policy is intended to provide guidelines for the reporting and investigation of such crimes. 

436.2   REPORTING 

(a) 

In an effort to maintain uniformity in reporting, officers presented with the crime of identity 
theft  (Tex.  Penal  Code  §  32.51)  shall  initiate  a  report  for  victims  residing  within  Austin, 
regardless of where the incident occurs. 

(b)  While victims should make a report to the law enforcement agency where the victim resides, 
officers of this department should investigate and report any identity theft related incident 
that  occurs  within  Austin,  regardless  of  where  the  victim  resides  (e.g.,  the  victim  lives 
elsewhere but the stolen credit card was used in Austin). 

(c) 

If a victim does not reside within Austin and the incident did not occur within APD jurisdiction, 
the officer may either take a courtesy report to be forwarded to the victim's residence agency 
or encourage the victim to promptly report the identity theft to the law enforcement agency 
where he resides. 

(d)  Officers should include all known incidents of fraudulent activity (e.g., credit card number 

applied for in victim's name when the victim has never made such an application). 

(e)  Officers  should  also  reference  all  known  reports  made  by  the  victim  (e.g.,  U.S.  Secret 
Service,  credit  reporting  bureaus,  U.S.  Postal  Service  and  Department  of  Public  Safety, 
Driver License Division) with all known report numbers. 

(f)  Officers should make a notation in the report narrative if the victim is an elderly individual, 
as defined by Tex. Penal Code § 22.04, since the penalty for offenses committed against 
an elderly individual is enhanced (Tex. Penal Code § 32.51). 

(g)  Following  supervisory    review  and  department  processing,  the  initial  report  should  be 
forwarded to the appropriate Investigative Unit for follow-up investigation, coordination with 
other agencies and prosecution as circumstances dictate. 

436.3   INFORMATION 
The victim should also contact the Federal Trade Commission, which is responsible for receiving 
and processing complaints under the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act. The victim 
can  contact  the  FTC  online  at  http://ftc.gov  or  by  telephone  at  1-877-ID  Theft  (877-438-4338). 
Additional information may be found at the United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) website,

Criminal Trespass 

437.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This policy outlines the procedures for handling criminal trespass situations. 

437.1.1   DEFINITIONS 
Entry - The intrusion of the entire body. 

Notice - This may be in the following forms: 

(a)  Oral or written communication by the owner or someone with apparent authority to act for 

the owner; or 

(b)  A sign(s) posted on the property or at the entrance to a building where it is reasonably likely 

to come to the attention of intruders indicating that entry is forbidden; or 

(c)  Fencing or any other enclosure designed to exclude intruders. 

Owner/Agent - Person(s) designated as the owner or with apparent authority to act on behalf of 
the owner (e.g., manager, custodian). 

437.2   INVESTIGATION GUIDELINES 
For a violation to have occurred: 

(a)  A subject must enter (or remain) in or on the property without consent of the owner/agent 
and the subject received notice that entry was forbidden (within one year prior to the current 
date); or 

(b)  A  subject  had  consent to  be  on the  property  but  the  owner/agent  has  withdrawn  consent 

and the subject fails to leave. 

437.2.1   ARREST AUTHORITY 
Officers  should  be  familiar  with  Texas  Penal  Code  30.05  (PC  30.05)  when  enforcing  criminal 
trespass offenses. Criminal trespass is not considered a breach of the peace, therefore: 

(a)  Residents may not legally arrest for this offense (e.g., citizen's arrest). 

(b)  No  arrest  for  criminal  trespass  will  be  made  unless  the  violation  occurs  in  the  officer's 

presence and meets the guidelines outlined in this policy. 

437.2.2   CONSENT WITHDRAWN 
In cases where a subject initially enters a property with consent but fails to leave when given notice 
to do so by the owner/agent, officers shall adhere to the following guidelines: 

(a)  Officers must witness: 

The subject in/on the property; and 

1. 

2. 

The owner/agent administer to the subject the notice to leave.

(b)  Arrest will not be made when conditions of the posted sign single out a specific 
class group such as transients, homeless people, or a minority group.

437.2.4   TRESPASS NOTICE NOT DOCUMENTED 
In cases where the subject is witnessed on the property by an officer and the owner/agent claims 
to have previously given a trespass notice to the subject but it is not documented; and 

(a)  The owner/agent will immediately furnish an affidavit attesting that a prior trespass notice 

was given to the subject, the subject may be arrested. 

(b)  The  owner/agent  cannot  or  will  not  immediately  furnish  an  affidavit  attesting  that  a  prior 

trespass notice was given to the subject:

under the Constitution and the laws of this state. When such rights are infringed upon by violence, 
threats or other harassment, this department will utilize all available resources to see that justice 
is served under the law. This policy has been developed to meet or exceed the provisions of the 
James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Act and provides members of this department with guidelines for 
identifying and investigating incidents and crimes that may be motivated by hatred or other bias. 

438.1.1   FEDERAL JURISDICTION 
The federal government also has the power to investigate and prosecute bias-motivated violence 
by providing the U.S. Department of Justice with jurisdiction over crimes of violence where the 
perpetrator  has  selected  the  victim  because  of  the  person's  actual  or  perceived  race,  color, 
religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or disability (18 USC 245). 

438.2   DEFINITIONS 
Hate  Crimes  -  An  intentional  criminal  act  committed  in  whole  or  in  part  because  of  a  bias  or 
prejudice against a person or group's (Tex. Code of Crim. Pro. art. 42.014): 

(a)     Disability 

(b)     Gender 

(c)     National origin or ancestry 

(d)     Race, ethnicity or color 

(e)     Religion 

(f)      Sexual orientation 

(g)     Age 

438.3   CRIMINAL STATUTES

prejudice. 

Tex. Penal Code § 22.04 - Prohibits assaulting elderly or disabled individuals. 

Tex. Penal Code § 25.071 - Violation of a protective order preventing an offense caused by bias 
or prejudice. 

438.4   UNDERSTANDING HATE CRIME ENHANCEMENT 
"Hate Crime" is not a specific offense that any person can be charged with but rather a penalty 
enhancement (Tex. Penal Code § 12.47).

Hate Crimes 

(a)  Officers cannot enhance the level of a crime at the time of booking even if there is sufficient 

evidence that the crime was motivated because of bias or prejudice. 

(b) 

Investigators do not control whether an offense committed because of bias or prejudice is 
enhanced; the decision to file for the enhancement is handled by the prosecution. 

(c)  The  enhancement  allows  for  specific  offenses  to  be  increased  to  the  next  category  of 

offense; however, a Class A misdemeanor cannot be increased to a felony. 

438.5   PROCEDURE FOR INVESTIGATING AN ALLEGED HATE CRIMES 
Whenever any member of the Department receives a report of a suspected hate crime, or other 
activity that reasonably appears to involve a potential hate crime, the following should occur: 

(a)  Officers will be assigned to the incident to conduct a preliminary investigation. 

(b)  A supervisor should be notified of the circumstances as soon as practicable. 

(c)  Once all "in progress" aspects of any such situation have been stabilized (e.g., treatment 
of victims, apprehension of suspects), the assigned officers will take all reasonable steps to 
preserve available evidence that may tend to establish that a hate crime was involved. 

(d)  Officers   will   interview   available   witnesses,   victims   and   others   to   determine   what 

circumstances, if any, indicate the situation may involve a hate crime. 

(e)  Officers should not tell individuals they are a victim of a hate crime as the determination is 

not made by law enforcement, however, officers should treat victims with empathy. 

(f)      Officers or supervisors may request additional assistance from the appropriate Investigative 

Unit or other resources to further the investigation. 

(g)  Officers should take photographs and collect physical evidence such as hate literature, spray 
paint cans, and symbolic objects used by hate groups (e.g., graffiti, clothing with symbols, 
letters). 

(h)     Officers will provide victims of any suspected hate crime with a Victim Assistance Information

Service Animals 

440.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Service animals play an important role in helping to overcome the limitations often faced by people 
with disabilities. The Austin Police Department recognizes this need and is committed to making 
reasonable modifications to its policies, practices and procedures in accordance with Title II of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) to permit the use of any animal that is individually 
trained to assist a person with a disability. 

440.2   SERVICE ANIMALS 
The ADA defines a service animal as any guide dog, signal dog or other animal individually trained 
to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. Service animals may be of any type or breed 
and need not be certified by any government agency or service group. 

Some service animals, such as guide dogs, may be readily identifiable but many do not have a 
distinctive symbol, harness or collar. 

The following examples are just some of the ways service animals may provide assistance: 

(a)  Guiding people who are blind or have impaired vision. 

(b)     Alerting people who are deaf or hard of hearing. 

that limit use of their hands, arms, or legs. 

(d)     Pulling Wheelchairs. 

(c)  Retrieving or picking up items, opening doors or flipping switches for people with disabilities 

(e)  Providing  physical  support  by  assisting  people  with  physical  disabilities  with  stability  and 

balance. 

(f)  Doing work or performing tasks for persons with traumatic brain injury, intellectual disabilities 
or psychiatric disabilities, such as reminding a person with depression to take medication 
or to wake the person. 

(g)  Alerting a person with anxiety to the onset of panic attacks; providing tactile stimulation to 
calm  a  person  with post  traumatic stress  disorder;  assisting  people with schizophrenia to 
distinguish between hallucinations and reality; and helping people with traumatic brain injury 
to locate misplaced items, to find places or to follow daily routines. 

440.3   EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES 
Under  the  Americans  with  Disabilities Act,  service  animals  assisting  individuals  with disabilities 
are permitted in all police facilities and areas where the general public is allowed. Employees are 
expected  to treat  individuals  with  service  animals  with  the  same  courtesy  and  respect  that  the 
Austin Police Department affords to all members of the public. 

If an animal exhibits vicious behavior, poses a direct threat to the health of others or unreasonably 
disrupts  or  interferes  with  normal  business  operations,  the  employee  may  direct  the  partner/ 
handler to remove the animal from the premises. Barking alone is not a threat nor does a direct

threat exist if the partner/handler takes prompt, effective action to control the animal. Each incident 
must be considered individually and past incidents alone are not cause for excluding a service 
animal.  Removal  of  a  service  animal  may  not  be  used  as  a  reason  to  refuse  service  to  an 
individual with disabilities. Members of this department are expected to provide all services as are 
reasonably available to the individual with the disability. 

If it is unclear whether an animal meets the definition of a service animal, officers should ask the 
individual only the following questions: 

(a)     Is the animal required because of a disability? 

(b)     What task or service has the service animal been trained to perform? 

If the individual explains that the animal is required because of a disability and has been trained 
to  work  or  perform  at  least  one  task,  the  animal  meets  the  definition  of  a  service  animal.  No 
further  question  as  to  the  animal's  status  should  be  asked.  The  person  should  not  be  asked 
questions about his disabilities nor should the person be asked to provide any license, certification 
or identification card for the service animal. 

Service animals are not pets. Employees should not interfere with the important work performed 
by a service animal by talking to, petting or otherwise initiating contact with a service animal. 

440.4   INQUIRIES AND COMPLAINTS 
When  handling  calls  of  a  complaint  regarding  a  service  animal,  members  of  this  department 
should remain neutral and should be prepared to explain the ADA requirements concerning service 
animals to the concerned parties. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, people with disabilities 
have the right to be accompanied by service animals in all public areas. 

(a)  Businesses are required to permit service animals to accompany their partner/handler in all 
areas that other customers or members of the public are allowed. Individuals who believe 
they have been discriminated against as a result of their disability should be referred to the 
Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. 

(b)  The  Austin  Police  Department  considers  interference  with  or  denial  of  this  right  by  any 
member  of  the  Department  to  be  a  serious  violation  of  this  policy.  Complaints  alleging 
violations of this policy against any Department employee will be promptly investigated and 
should be referred to the Internal Affairs Unit.

to an on-duty CIT officer or the CIT Unit. An incident report will be completed as outlined in this 
policy.

be used when: 

The officer has reason to believe, and does believe, that the person is mentally ill; and 

Because of that mental illness there is a substantial risk of serious harm to the person 
or to others unless the person is immediately restrained; and 

The officer believes that there is not sufficient time to obtain a warrant before taking 
the person into custody. 

(b)  An employee encountering a person who needs to be assessed for a possible POEC shall 
contact  an  on-duty  CIT Officer.  If  no  on-duty  CIT  Officer  is  available  within  a  reasonable

orientation unless such information is relevant to the individual's criminal conduct or 
activity or if required to identify the individual. 

4. 

An individual's age other than to determine if someone is a minor. 

(b)  The Austin Police Department will not directly or indirectly receive, seek, accept, or retain 
information  from  an  individual  or  nongovernmental  information  provider  who  may  or  may 
not receive a fee or benefit for providing the information if there is reason to believe that the 
information provider is legally prohibited from obtaining or disclosing the information.

(c)  No officer shall enter the perimeter or building at any time during a canine call unless directed 

to do so by a Canine Officer. 

1. 

2. 

If a suspect moves within the perimeter, officers shall remain on the perimeter and

This does not restrict an outside agency from using its own Canine Unit on any call that the agency 
initiates which then enters APD jurisdiction (e.g., vehicle pursuits).

The use of the air support can be invaluable in certain situations. This policy specifies potential 
situations where use of air support may be requested and the responsibilities for making a request. 

504.2   REQUEST FOR AIR SUPPORT ASSISTANCE 
APD Air Operations shall be the primary responder for all aircraft assistance requests originating 
within the Department. 

(a) 

(b) 

If  a  supervisor  or  officer  in  charge  of  an  incident  determines  that  the  use  of  air  support 
would  be  beneficial,  a  request  for  APD  Air  Operations  shall  be  made  by  contacting 
Communications. 

If APD Air Operations is unavailable or off-duty and an officer needs aircraft assistance to 
conduct law enforcement related activities, a request to another law enforcement agency or 
Starflight shall be made through an APD Air Operations supervisor or the Watch Lieutenant 
as follows: 

1.  When the situation involves imminent danger to officers or the public, the request for 
assistance must be approved by the Watch Lieutenant. The Watch Lieutenant will 
then immediately notify Air Operations supervisor.

duty  or  on-call  Air  Operations  supervisor  to  determine  the  appropriate  course  of 
action.

officer shall notify Communications of the victim's age, sex and injuries and request EMS. 
The decision to call Starflight for medical purposes is the responsibility of EMS ground units. 
Officers  shall  be responsible for  setting  up  and maintaining  a  landing  zone as  outlined  in 
this policy. 

504.2.1   CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH AID MAY BE REQUESTED 
While it is recognized that the availability of air support will generally provide valuable assistance 
to ground personnel, the presence of air support will rarely replace the need for officers on the 
ground. 

Law enforcement air support may be requested under any of the following conditions: 

(a)  When the aircraft is activated under existing mutual aid agreements. 

(b)  Whenever the safety of law enforcement personnel is in jeopardy and the presence of the 

aircraft may reduce such hazard. 

(c)  When the use of aircraft will aid in the capture of a suspected fleeing felon whose continued 

freedom represents an ongoing threat to the community.

investigation  as  completely  as  possible  for  later  follow-up  by  the  appropriate 
investigative unit. 

1. 

If an interpreter is not available in a reasonable period of time, a supervisor shall be 
contacted to decide if an investigator should be called in to wait for an interpreter. 
If  the  supervisor  decides  that  an  investigator  should  not  respond,  the  officer  must 
document  the  investigation  as  completely  as  possible  for  later  follow-up  by  the 
appropriate investigative unit. 

609.3.2   COMMUNICATING WITH A SUSPECT BEFORE ARREST 
If probable cause exists for the arrest of a hearing impaired person and the same standard would 
apply  to  a  suspect  without  a  hearing  impairment,  then  no  interpreter  would  be  required  before 
arrest unless the officer is unable to convey the nature of the criminal charges. 

If the arrestee does not decline the opportunity to communicate through an interpreter, the arrestee 
should be transported to the Central Booking facility. Either the arresting officer or the transporting 
officer can convey the information through the interpreter upon arrival. 

609.3.3   INTERROGATING AN ARRESTEE 
If an officer cannot inform the arrestee of the Miranda warnings without the use of an interpreter, 
then the officer must secure an interpreter before any interrogation. 

(a)  Hearing  impaired  suspects  must  be  provided  an  interpreter  before  any  interrogation 
whenever one is needed for effective communication. If exigent circumstances do not allow 
a  delay  in  the  interrogation  of  the  arrestee  and  an  interpreter  cannot  respond  within  a 
reasonable period, the officer may go on with the interrogation only if: 

1. 

2. 

The arrestee can understand the Miranda warnings as given; and 

The arrestee specifically declines the opportunity to have an interpreter present. 

(b) 

If  written  communication  becomes  ineffective,  the  officer  must  stop  the  interrogation  and 
wait until an interpreter is present. 

609.3.4   COMMUNICATING WITH A TRAFFIC VIOLATOR 
If  a  person  without  a  hearing  impairment  would  be  issued  a traffic  citation  without  the  need  of 
being questioned, then a person with a hearing impairment in the same situation does not need 
to be provided an interpreter. 

If  an  officer  has  stopped  a  subject  for  a  traffic  violation  and  is  unable  to  convey  the  nature  of 
the infraction, the officer should use discretion about whether to call an interpreter or to issue a 
warning rather than a citation. 

609.3.5   INTERVIEWING A VICTIM OR CRITICAL WITNESS 
If officers can communicate effectively in writing with a hearing impaired person, they may proceed 
with an interview using a notepad. However, if an investigating officer is unable to communicate

cannot wait until an interpreter arrives, the following procedures apply: 

1.  Have an interpreter dispatched to the victim's or critical witness's location and request 
APD Communications re-contact the officer when the interpreter arrives; or 

2. 

The  officer  may  ask the victim  or  critical  witness to  come  voluntarily  to  the  station 
when an interpreter is available. When the victim/witness arrives, the investigating 
officer  may  then  return  to  the  station  to  complete  the  investigation  or  make 
arrangements for follow-up by the appropriate investigative unit. 

(b)  Serious Offenses 

1.  When  the  victim  or  witness  with  a  hearing  impairment  is  critical  to  establishing 
probable  cause  for  an  arrest  or  for  completing  the  investigation,  the  investigating 
officer  must  contact  the  appropriate  supervisor  before  leaving  the  scene.  The 
supervisor  will  decide  if  an  investigator  will  be  called  in  to  wait  for  an  interpreter. 
If  the  supervisor  decides  that  an  investigator  should  not  respond,  the  officer  must

operational  personnel  in  meeting  their  tactical  crime  control  and  prevention  objectives  by 
identifying and analyzing methods of operation of criminals, providing crime pattern recognition, 
and providing analysis of data from field interviews and arrests. Crime analysis can be useful to 
the  Department's  long  range  planning  efforts  by  providing  estimates  of future  crime  trends  and 
assisting in the identification of enforcement priorities. 

610.2   DATA SOURCES 
Crime analysis data is extracted from many sources including, but not limited to: 

(a)  Crime reports 

(b)     Field interviews 

(c)     Computer aided dispatch data 

(d)     Department of Public Safety - Crime Records Service 

(e)     Open Record / Public Information Sources 

610.3   CRIME ANALYSIS FACTORS 
The following minimum criteria should be used in collecting data for crime analysis: 

•        Frequency by type of crime 

•        Geographic factors 

•        Temporal factors 

•        Victim and target descriptors 

•        Suspect descriptors 

•        Suspect vehicle descriptors 

•        Modus operandi factors 

•        Physical evidence information 

610.4   CRIME ANALYSIS DISSEMINATION 
For  a  crime  analysis  system  to  function  effectively,  information  should  be  disseminated  to  the 
appropriate units or persons on a timely basis. Information that is relevant to the operational and 
tactical plans of specific line units should be sent directly to that unit. Information relevant to the 
development of the Department's strategic plans should be provided to the appropriate staff units. 
When information pertains to tactical and strategic plans, it should be provided to all affected units.

security  of  individuals  are  at  increased  risk.  The  cameras  are  installed  at  the  direction  of  the 
Department and operated in such a manner that will protect individual privacy rights. 

The  decision  to place  cameras  in specific  locations  will  be  made based  on  current  crime data, 
large crowd events, or community requests. The Department acknowledges that real-time camera 
monitoring of the public safety cameras is ideal but that this may not always be feasible due to 
resource constraints.

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

General Conduct and Responsibilities 

900.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
It is the policy of the Austin Police Department that employees conduct themselves at all times 
in a manner that reflects the ethical standards consistent with APD written directives. This policy 
shall apply to all sworn and civilian members, including volunteer, part-time, auxiliary, and non- 
paid civilians affiliated with the Department through a Department-sponsored program while under 
the direction of a Department employee. 

This policy is intended to guide employees in conducting themselves and their affairs, both on- 
duty and off-duty, in a manner that reflects the professionalism required of Department personnel. 
Furthermore, this policy is intended for internal use only and shall not be construed to increase 
or establish an employee's civil or criminal liability, nor shall it be construed to create or establish 
a higher standard of safety or care. 

900.1.1   RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW AND COMPLY 
The rules of conduct set forth in this policy do not serve as an all-inclusive list of requirements, 
limitations, or prohibitions on employee conduct and activities; employees are required to know 
and comply with all Department policies, procedures, and written directives. 

(a)  Employees  will  maintain  a  working  knowledge  and  comply  with  the  laws,  ordinances, 
statutes, regulations, and APD written directives which pertain to their assigned duties. 

(b)  Employees  who  do  not  understand  their  assigned  duties  or  responsibilities  will  read  the 
relevant directives and guidelines, and will consult their immediate supervisor for clarification 
and explanation. 

(c)     A lack of knowledge of an APD written directive is not a defense to disciplinary action. 

900.2   REQUIRED REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS 
Employees  have  an  obligation  and  responsibility  to report  all  facts  or  credible  information they 
know regarding any criminal activity by other employees or any breach of APD written directives.

General Conduct and Responsibilities 

(a)  Employees will report any employee known or believed to be guilty of any violation of 
a rule, regulation, or order issued by the Department to their immediate supervisor. 

(b)  Supervisors  will  immediately  take  action  as  outlined  in  Policy  902  (Administrative 
Investigations) when a violation of a directive comes to their attention, regardless of 
the supervisor's or violator's assignment or rank within the Department. 

900.2.1   CONFIDENTIALITY 
All information relating to an employee's suspected criminal act or policy violation is confidential. 
(a)  Exce 
pt as required in reporting the incident: 
 

 

Employees  will  not  disclose  or  discuss  such  information  with  anyone  except 
investigators assigned to the case, the employee's attorney, employee's chain-of- 
command or other persons specifically designated by the Chief. 

 

1. 

2. 

 

 

Investigators of such cases will not disclose or discuss information about any such 
investigation  with  anyone  except  other  investigators  assigned  to  assist  with  the 
investigation,  the  investigator's  chain-of-command,  officers  of  the  court,  or  other 
persons specifically designated by the Chief. 

900.2.2   RETALIATION PROHIBITED

who  has  been  involved  in  any  such  investigation  or  subsequent  proceeding  as  a  defendant, 
complainant,  witness,  victim,  investigator,  or  any  other  capacity. While  the  Department  wishes 
to  avoid  reassigning  an  employee  while  a  complaint  or  grievance  is  being  investigated,  this 
policy  does  not  prohibit  the  Department  from  doing  so,  including  the  complainant/victim,  while 
the  complaint  or  grievance  is  under  investigation  should  an  assistant  chief  determine  that  a 
reassignment is in the best interest of the Department and/or the employee. 

900.3   GENERAL CONDUCT 
This section contains the expectations and requirements of employee conduct, both on-duty and 
off-duty, and causes for disciplinary action due to employee misconduct. This is not intended to 
cover every possible type of misconduct and does not preclude the recommendation of disciplinary 
action for specific action or inaction that is detrimental to efficient Department service. 

900.3.1   HONESTY 
Honesty is of the utmost importance in the police profession. Employees are expected to be truthful 
at all times in the performance of their duties. 

(a)  Employees  will  speak  the  truth  at  all  times  and  reflect  the  truth  in  all  reports  and  written 
communications.  Any  statement  or  omission  of  pertinent  or  material  information  which 
intentionally  misrepresents  facts  or  misleads  others  through  an  official  statement  will  be 
considered a false official statement. The following are examples of an "official statement":

901.5.2   RELEASING WITHOUT FILING CHARGES OR FILING LESSER CHARGES 
Approval by the commander of Violent Crimes or Duty Commander is required to release an APD 
employee or officer from another agency without filing charges or to charge the employee or officer 
with a lesser offense. The name of the commander authorizing a change in the filing of charges 
will be noted in a supplement to the incident report. 

(a)  When  authorized  by  a  commander,  an  arrested  person  will  be  released  without  being 

charged or will be charged with a lesser offense when:

6. 

7. 

A magistrate declines to accept the probable cause affidavit. 

An Assistant District or County Attorney advises prosecution will be declined. 

The complainant or victim refuses to file charges or assist with prosecution. However, 
the District or County Attorney may proceed with prosecution without the cooperation 
of the victim, such as in family violence cases. 

The written report by the arresting officer does not include sufficient probable cause 
for the arrest, or fails to establish that a crime occurred. 

(a)  The  assigned  detective  will  attempt  to  contact the  arresting  officer  prior  to 

releasing the prisoner to obtain additional probable cause or information. 

(b) 

If the detective is unable to contact the arresting officer, the prisoner may be 
released pending further investigation. 

After investigation by the assigned detective, there is insufficient probable cause to 
support charging the arrested person. 

Filing charges may jeopardize prosecution of a more serious offense. 

The  arrested  person  is  willing  to  assist  detectives  and  can  provide  specific 
information that will solve a more serious offense or numerous equal offenses. 

8.  Considering all available information, the facts will not support the original offense, 

but do support the filing of lesser charges. 

901.6   CONFIDENTIALITY 

(a)  All investigations conducted by the SIU are of a confidential nature. No member of SIU will 
disclose information gained from their official duties as Department employees to persons 
not connected with SIU, Internal Affairs, or to persons who have no legitimate need to know. 

(b)  Reports investigated by the SIU are secured in the computer reporting system to prevent 
viewing by unauthorized individuals. These reports can be unsecured by a SIU supervisor 
when there is no longer a need to secure them from viewing.

or Division based on the 
circumstances surrounding the 
inquiry. 

Class  A complaints are 
investigated by lA. Complaints that 
involve allegations of criminal 
conduct are also concurrently 
investigated by SIU as outlined in 
Policy 901. 

An inquiry into a critical incident, or 
other incident, ordered by the Chief 
or designee. Inquiries are generally 
for issues that could  destroy public 
confidence  in, and respect for, the 
Department or which is prejudicial to 
the good order of the Department. 

Cases  in which the potential discipline 
is more  than a 15-day suspension, 
indefinite suspension  and/ or demotion 
according  to the  Discipline Matrix. 
Generally, Class  A complaints are 
allegations of a serious nature, which 
include, but are not limited to: 
Criminal  conduct. 

Serious  violations of a policy, rule, or 
regulation. 

Conduct that challenges the 
integrity, good order, or discipline 
of the Department. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Class  B 
Complaint 

Cases in which the potential 
discipline is a 15-day suspension  or 
less. Generally, Class  B complaints 
are allegations of a less serious 
nature, which include, but are not 
limited to: 

Less serious violations of a 
Department policy, rule or 
regulation (e.g.,  profanity, 
belittling language, inadequate 
police service, minor traffic 
violations). 
Negligent  damage or loss of

investigated by lA. The OPM has 
full access rights to Class B 
investigations that are conducted 
by an employee's chain-of- 
command.  Class B complaints 
are resolved through three 
different procedures: 

•   Investigation  by lA or the 
chain-of-command 

•   OFCA if eligible 
•   Mediation if eligible

The complaint would best be handled

processes (e.g., grievance, Conduct 
Counseling Memorandum, Employee 
Success  Plan,  or training). 

Allegations that do not rise to the 
level of a policy violation and meet 
one or more of the 
following criteria: 

A preliminary review of the allegation 
shows  it is not true (e.g., video or 
audio recording shows  allegation is 
false), and/or the complaint is about 
the probable cause for an arrest or 
citation that appears to be 
unsubstantiated. 

An incident where no formal 
Complaint affidavit has been received 
by lA, however the complainant 
requests that the issue be brought to 
the attention of a supervisor. These 
informal complaints are made directly 
to lA and/or  the OPM. 

An incident where  no apparent 
policy violation has been committed 
and  a signed affidavit has not been 
received. Information incidents may 
also be from complaints that are 
brought to the direct attention of a 
supervisor, handled satisfactorily 
and documented on an /A External 
Complainant Contact Form. 

 

 

 

 

 

Class C complaints will be reviewed 
by the lA commander  and the 
employee's chain-of- command. If all 
of the parties 
agree with the initial Class C 
classification, the complaint will be 
"Administratively  Closed". If it is 
determined that additional 
investigative follow-up is needed, 
the complaint may be reclassified 
and investigated  according to its 
new classification. 

Class  D complaints will  be 
reviewed by  the  lA  commander 
and  the  employee's chain-of- 
command. If  all  of the  parties 
agree  with  the  initial  Class  D 
classification, the  complaint will 
be  "administratively closed". If  it 
is  determined that  additional 
investigative follow-up is 
needed, the  complaint may  be 
reclassified and  investigated 
according to  its  new 
classification. 

If IAIOPM receives this informal 
complaint from a citizen, it will be 
forwarded to the appropriate 
supervisor and chain-of-command 
for its follow-up and response. 
Supervisor referrals are entered into 
the lA tracking system for 
documentation purposes only and 
not for disciplinary purposes. 

Complaints documented using the 
/A External Complainant Contact 
Form will be forwarded to  lA with a 
notation that the complaint either 
was/was not handled satisfactorily. 
Satisfactorily handled complaints will 
be marked as "Information." 

Information incidents are entered

902.4   COMPLAINT INVESTIGATION 
After IA has received, classified and entered a complaint into ICMS, the complaint will be assigned 
to  the  unit  or  command with  appropriate  investigative  responsibility  based  on  the  classification 
level. Minor nature complaints that have been satisfactorily handled by a supervisor will be entered 
into ICMS and closed as "information." 

902.4.1   COOPERATING WITH ASSIGNED INVESTIGATORS 

(a)  Employees  will  cooperate  with  any  assigned  investigator  as  if  they  were  addressing  the 
Chief. Employees who fail or refuse to cooperate with an assigned investigator will be subject 
to disciplinary action, up to and including indefinite suspension.

2. 

Employees  who  are  found  to  have  given  a  false  official  statement  are  subject  to 
indefinite suspension as outlined in the Discipline Matrix ("Dishonesty - False Official 
Statements"). 

There may be cases where officers have not been truthful but the dishonesty does 
not constitute a false official statement. In those situations, the Chief shall consider 
each case on a fact specific basis and may decide that corrective action other than 
indefinite  suspension  is warranted  as  outlined in  the  Discipline  Matrix  ("Neglect  of 
Duty - Misleading Statements"). 

902.4.2   WITHDRAWN COMPLAINTS 

(a) 

(b) 

If  the  complainant  withdraws  their  complaint  or  refuses  to  further  cooperate  with  the 
administrative investigation, the investigation may be closed as incomplete. 

If the nature of the allegations can be sufficiently determined without the assistance of the 
complainant, the investigation shall proceed and be completed as normal. 

902.5   ALLEGATIONS OF CRIMINAL CONDUCT 
When employees are accused of potential criminal conduct, SIU shall be assigned to investigate 
the  criminal  allegations  as  outlined  in  Policy  901  (Special  Investigations)  apart  from  any 
administrative  investigation.  This  section  explains  how  IA  and  SIU  work  together  in  concurrent 
investigations. 

902.5.1   CONCURRENT CRIMINAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATIONS 
The Chief will normally allow the administrative investigation and/or disciplinary action to proceed 
prior to the final (legal) disposition of any criminal investigation of an employee. 

Internal Affairs will proceed with a concurrent investigation in cases involving a policy violation. SIU 
and IA shall  coordinate  their  investigations  and make  a  joint  determination  concerning  whether 
involved  officer(s)  and  witnesses  should  be  initially  interviewed  by  SIU  or  IA.  Supervisors  and

902.5.3   180 DAY INVESTIGATION TIME FRAME 
Generally, in order for a sworn employee to be temporarily suspended, demoted,  or indefinitely 
suspended for allegations based on a criminal nature, an investigation must be completed and 
discipline  imposed  within  180  days  from  the  date  the  Department  discovers  the  allegation, 
provided  that  the  officer  is  still  subject  to  prosecution  under  the  applicable  criminal  statute  of 
limitations. 

(a) 

If a prosecutor notifies the SIU supervisor that taking disciplinary action will jeopardize the 
criminal  investigation,  the  Chief  or  designee  shall  decide  whether  to  notify  the  Attorney 
General of his or her intent to take disciplinary action outside of the 180 day statutory period. 
Notification to the Attorney General is authorized only when the following criteria have been 
met: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

The Chief or designee, at the time of the filing of the notice with the Attorney General, 
intends to indefinitely suspend the officer; and 

The  prosecutor  has  notified  the  Chief  or  designee  that  a  delay  in  imposing  an 
indefinite suspension is necessary to protect a criminal investigation; and 

The Chief or designee consults with the IA legal advisor concerning the propriety of 
filing the notice to the Attorney General. 

902.6   ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION GUIDELINES 
Generally, in order for a sworn employee to be temporarily suspended, demoted, or indefinitely 
suspended for  allegations  of  an  administrative nature,  an  investigation must  be  completed  and

classification agreement (OFCA) outlined in section 902.6.4. 

(a)  Once  IA  has  completed  their  investigation  they  shall  give  the  involved  employee's 
commander access to the case file. The commander shall recommend a disposition for the 
allegation based upon a preponderance of the evidence. Disposition guidelines are outlined 
in Section 902.7. 

If   the  recommended   disposition   is  "sustained,"   commanders   shall  follow  the 
guidelines for administration of discipline as described in Section 902.9 and inform 
IA of the recommended discipline based on the Discipline Matrix. 

If the disposition of all allegations is something other than "sustained", commanders 
shall notify IA who will then close the case. 

(b)     IA shall notify the employee of the results of the investigation on Department memorandum. 

902.6.3   INVESTIGATIONS HANDLED BY EMPLOYEE'S CHAIN-OF-COMMAND 

(a)  Assignment to Command 

1.  Class B investigations that are eligible to be handled as an OFCA will be assigned 
to  the  employee’s  chain-of-command.    If  either  the  commander  in  charge  or  the 
officer do not accept the OFCA option, the investigation will remain with the chain- 
of-command and be conducted as a full Class B investigation. 

For investigations conducted by an employee's chain-of-command, the commander 
of the employee shall be designated as the commander in charge of the investigation. 
The command that the subject officer is currently assigned to will normally conduct

(a)  Minor  nature  complaints  shall  be  reviewed  by  an  IA  lieutenant  and/or  commander  to 
determine if the complaint falls into an eligible category for OFCA. If the complaint falls within 
an eligible category, an IA lieutenant shall review the officer's complaint history to determine 
if there are any patterns of behavior or serious allegations which would eliminate them from 
eligibility. 

(b)  The following guidelines shall be used to determine which complaints may be eligible: 

1.  Class B INTERNAL complaints that involve less serious violations of Department 
policies  or  procedures  where  the  Matrix  guidelines  allow  for  discipline  not  greater 
than three (3) days may be eligible. Examples include, but are not limited to: 

(a)  Failure to Qualify. 

(b)  Accidental Discharge. 

(c)  Pursuits. 

(d)  Officer Involved Collisions. 

2.  Class B EXTERNAL complaints that involve less serious violations of Department 
policies, or procedures where the Matrix guidelines allow for discipline not greater 
than a written reprimand may be eligible. Examples include but are not limited to: 

(a)  Allegations of profanity and/or inappropriate language. 

(b)  Allegations of inadequate police service. 

(c)  Allegations of rudeness. 

3.  Class A, C and D complaints are not eligible. 

4. 

An officer with 2 or more complaints of a similar nature within the previous 12 months 
is not eligible for the OFCA for similar subsequent violations. 

(c) 

If the officer is found to be eligible for OFCA, IA shall simultaneously notify the officer's chain- 
of-command  and  the  OPM  of  said  determination.  If  the  officer's  Commander  agrees  that 
the officer is eligible then the officer shall be offered this option when they are served with 
their Notice of Allegations. Officers agreeing with the complaint and wanting to invoke their 
OFCA option may do so by submitting a memorandum along with a signed OFCA form to 
IA within 48 hours of receiving the Notice of Allegations. 

(d)  By  accepting  the  OFCA,  the  officer  is  accepting  responsibility  for  their  actions  and  the 
complaint shall receive a final disposition of sustained. The officer will not receive discipline 
exceeding  a  three  (3)  day  suspension  for  internal  complaints  or  a  written  reprimand  for 
external  complaints.  These  cases  are  not  subject  to  additional  investigation  unless  new 
information  is  received  that  indicates  a more  serious  policy  violation  may  have  occurred. 
OFCA's  should  be  completed  within  20  days  of  the  date  the  investigation  is  assigned  to 
the chain-of-command. If an OFCA is invoked, the 10  business  days  time frame for the 
administration of discipline does not apply.

902.6.5   INVESTIGATIONS HANDLED THROUGH MEDIATION 
As  an  alternative  to the normal IA  process utilized  in investigating  complaints,  the  complainant 
and involved officer(s) may be invited to voluntarily participate in mediation. Mediation shall be an 
option discussed by the Office of the Police Monitor (OPM) intake staff after the external complaint 
affidavit has been submitted by the complainant. Complaints recommended for mediation will be 
noted on the OPM Interoffice Delivery Sheet. The OPM Interoffice Delivery Sheet and the original 
external  complaint  affidavit  will  be  delivered to  IA  by OPM  staff. Once mediation  has  occurred, 
the matter cannot be returned to the Department to be handled as a disciplinary matter unless 
the officer fails to complete the mediation session. Complaints resolved via mediation will not be 
counted as an incident in the Guidance Advisory Program. 

(a)  The OPM intake staff shall not offer mediation to the complainant at the conclusion of the 
external  complaint  affidavit  intake  or  as  a  complaint  resolution  option.  Approval  from  the 
chain  of  command  and willingness  on  the  part  of  the  officer  to  mediate a  complaint  shall 
be  obtained prior to offering  mediation  to  the  complainant. To  do  otherwise may  yield an 
unintended consequence of mistrust or dissatisfaction on the part of the complainant. 

(b)  Complaints  shall  be  reviewed  by  the  IA  lieutenant  or  commander  within  two  (2)  business 
days of receipt to determine whether they would be appropriate for mediation. Only Class 
B  external  complaints  that  involve  less  serious  violations  of  Department  policies  and 
procedures may be eligible for mediation. Examples may include, but are not necessarily 
limited to: 

Allegations of profanity, belittling or rudeness. 

Allegations of inadequate police service. 

1. 

2. 

(c) 

If  mediation  is  deemed  appropriate  for  the  allegation,  the  IA  Lieutenant  shall  review  the 
officer's  complaint  history  and  confer  with  the  officer's  chain  of  command  to  determine  if 
the officer meets the qualifications for the mediation process. The chain of command shall 
report back to the IA lieutenant within five (5) calendar days indicating whether the officer 
has accepted or declined mediation as a complaint resolution. The option to utilize mediation 
may be withdrawn by the Chief or designee if withdrawal is deemed to be in the best interest 
of the Department. 

1.  Officers will be eligible to choose mediation as an option to resolve complaints of a 
substantially similar nature no more than once every 6 months or twice per calendar 
year. 

2. 

IA  will  consult  with  the  officer's  chain  of  command  to  determine  if  subsequent 
complaints are of a substantially similar nature to previous complaints. 

(d)  The officer's chain of command must obtain and review any audio/video related to the officer/ 
complainant interaction. If the parties agree to mediate the complaint, the audio/video will 
be submitted to IA, copied to a designated flash drive or other portable media and supplied 
to the Dispute Resolution Center for the mediation session.

Coordinator will notify the Dispute Resolution Center of the referral via facsimile. The 
OPM Mediation Coordinator will furnish a summary of the incident and allegations

professional manner during the session, and is bound by policy. The officer is expected to 
fully participate in the mediation session. The officer shall wear a uniform or clothing suitable 
for court, as outlined in policy. Officers will not be prohibited from carrying their duty weapon 
while participating in a mediation session, but must comply with department policy regarding 
weapons. 

(j)  Mediation  sessions  are  confidential.  Unless  all  parties  agree,  only  complainants,  officers, 
and the mediators will be allowed into the session. A qualified, neutral interpreter will also 
be  present  if  the  complainant  or  a third party mediator  deems such  action necessary.  All 
parties will be required to sign a Dispute Resolution Center Agreement to Mediate Waiver 
and Consent form. Once the form is signed by both parties and the mediation session has 
commenced, there is no provision for a complaint to be returned to IAD for investigation if 
the complainant is dissatisfied with the mediation process or the outcome of the mediation 
session. The mediation session will not result in a written agreement between the parties.

Coordinator  a  written  response  stating  whether  both  parties  appeared  and  whether  the 
session  resulted  in  a  completed  mediation.  This  written  response  will  be  submitted  to 
the  OPM  Mediation  Coordinator  and  entered  into  ICMS.  The  written  documentation  will 
be  maintained  by  IA.  Although  the  mediation  session  is  confidential,  the  nature  of  the 
complaint and the officer's identifying information shall be recorded in the ICMS database 
as a 'mediated' complaint. Mediated complaints will NOT be included as an incident in the 
Guidance Advisory Program (GAP).

902.6.6   MEDIATION SCHEDULING CONFLICTS 

(a) 

If  the  officer  or  complainant  is  going  to  be  late  for  the  scheduled  mediation,  they  should 
contact the Dispute Resolution Center to inform them what time they will arrive: 

If the officer or complainant will be delayed less than 20 minutes, the session shall 
commence upon the party's arrival. 

If  the  officer  or  complainant  will  be  delayed  more  than  20  minutes,  the  Dispute 
Resolution Center shall consult with the other party to determine whether the delay 
is acceptable or whether that party would prefer to reschedule. 

(b) 

If  the  officer  or  complainant  is  unable  to  attend  the  mediation  due  to  an  unforeseen 
emergency,  they  should  make  every  effort  to  immediately  notify  the  Dispute  Resolution 
Center  to  have  the  session  rescheduled.  The  officer  shall  also  contact  the  IA  lieutenant 
regarding any cancellation and/or rescheduling. If the officer or complainant fails to appear 
and does not call the mediator, the mediation session shall be canceled for that day and the 
mediator will notify the OPM Mediation Coordinator and IA. 

The OPM Mediation Coordinator shall attempt to make contact with the complainant 
to determine if there was a legitimate reason for the complainant's failure to attend 
the mediation session. If it is determined by the OPM Mediation Coordinator that a 
reasonable explanation did exist, the mediation session shall be rescheduled. If the 
OPM Mediation Coordinator determines the complainant did not have a reasonable 
explanation  for  missing  the  mediation  session,  the  complaint  shall  be  closed  as  a 
contact by IA. 

The IA lieutenant shall contact the officer to determine if there was a legitimate reason 
for  the  officer's  failure  to  attend  the  mediation  session.  If  it  is  determined  that  an 
explanation did exist, the mediation session shall be rescheduled. If IA determines 
the officer did not have a reasonable explanation for missing the mediation session,

902.6.7   EDUCATIONAL BASED DISCIPLINE 
Educational based discipline (EBD) is an alternative to traditional discipline suspensions. EBD 
reduces  management-employee  conflict  and  offers  behavior  focused  education  and  training, 
enhanced communication, character, competence, and trust which is beneficial to the employee 
and  the  department.  Minor  nature  complaints  shall  be  reviewed  by  an  IA  lieutenant  and/or 
commander to determine if the complaint falls into an eligible category for EBD. If the complaint 
falls  within  an  eligible  category,  an  IA  lieutenant  shall  review  the  officer’s  complaint  history  to 
determine if there are any patterns of behavior or serious allegations which would eliminate them 
from eligibility. 

(a)     A subject officer may be eligible for educational based discipline for a suspension of 1 to 

5 days: 

1. 

The  EBD  must  be  offered  by  the  Chief  of  Police,  their  designee,  or  the  involved 
officer's chain of command 

2. 

The involved officer must voluntarily accept the EBD 

(a)  The  EBD  days  are  not  a  one  for  one  replacement  for  the  number  of 

suspension days and may be more or less 

(b)  All EBD classes will be attended while on duty 

(c)  The involved officer must waive their right to appeal 

3. 

All classes must be completed within one year of the subject officer's acceptance 
of the EBD. 

(a) 

If the training is not completed within one year, the involved officer will receive 
the original number of recommended days off with no right to appeal 

(b)     Educational Based Discipline cannot be utilized for written reprimand, suspensions above 
5 days, indefinite suspensions, demotions, or certain policy violations as determined by the 
Chief of Police.

902.7   DISPOSITION PROCESS 
Regardless of which unit or command conducts an investigation, the involved employee's chain- 
of-command  is  responsible  for  recommending  a  disposition  for  each  allegation  based  on  the 
guidelines below. The final disposition for any allegation is ultimately determined by the Chief of 
Police or designee. Pursuant to a Department of Justice recommendation and a study of industry- 
wide best practices, IA does not recommend a disposition for any complaints. 

902.7.1   DISPOSITIONS 
Each allegation shall be designated with one of the following dispositions based on a finding of 
fact and considering the totality of circumstances. The standard of proof used to arrive at a final 
disposition is a "preponderance of the evidence." 

Sustained - When the investigation discloses sufficient evidence to establish that the act occurred 
and that it constituted misconduct. 

Exonerated - When the investigation discloses that the alleged act occurred but that the act was 
justified, lawful and/or proper according to Departmental policy. 

Unfounded - When the investigation discloses that the alleged act(s) did not occur. 

Inconclusive - When the investigation discloses that there is insufficient evidence to sustain the 
complaint or fully exonerate the employee. 

Administratively  Closed  -  Complaints  will  be  administratively  closed  under  the  following 
circumstances: 

(a)  An administrative inquiry has been completed and no allegations were made or misconduct 

discovered. 

(b)  The case was classified as a Class C or Class D complaint. 

(c)  At the discretion of the Chief or designee. 

Mediated - Completed the mediation process as detailed in this policy. 

Retired or resigned under investigation. 

Information - An incident maintained for documentation purposes only. 

Supervisor Referral - An informal complaint referred to a supervisor for their attention. 

If an investigation discloses misconduct or improper job performance which was not alleged in 
the original complaint, the investigator shall take appropriate action with regard to any possible

additional allegations. Any additional allegations shall go through the assessment, classification, 
and investigation process. 

902.8   POST INVESTIGATIVE REVIEW 
Any complaining party who is not satisfied with the findings of the Department concerning their 
complaint may contact the OPM to discuss the matter further. 

902.8.1   CITIZEN REVIEW PANEL 
Internal  investigations may  be  brought  before  the  Citizen  Review  Panel  (CRP)  by  the  OPM  as 
detailed in the Meet and Confer Agreement. 

(a)  The  commander  in  charge  of  the  investigation  shall  be  responsible  for  appearing  before 
the  CRP  and  presenting  the  case  under  review.  The  commander  in charge  shall  answer 
questions concerning an investigation subject to the CRP's review. 

(b)  The  Police  Monitor  and  the  CRP  may  make  recommendations  to  the  Chief  of  Police  on 

disciplinary matters involving critical incidents. 

(c)  The commander in charge of the investigation shall be responsible for responding, in writing, 
to any recommendations issued by the Police Monitor or CRP concerning an investigation 
conducted under their command. 

902.9   DISCIPLINE PROCESS 
The  Discipline  Process  is  a  guide  to  be  used  by  all  levels  of  management  in  determining  the 
appropriate discipline based upon the type of violation committed. This process does not create 
a binding procedural or substantive due process right for any officer. 

The guidelines recommended do not diminish the authority of the Chief of Police in determining 
whatever disciplinary action is necessary to maintain the integrity of the Department. The Chief 
of Police retains the full authority to make all disciplinary decisions. Deviation from this process, 
whether  by  the  Chief  or  any  other  manager,  does  not  violate  any  procedural  or  substantive 
rights of any officer unless the deviation violates a specific right guaranteed by law or the Meet 
and  Confer  Agreement. The  Chief  retains the  right  to  dissolve this  process  at  anytime,  without 
consulting with, or obtaining the approval of any employee. Further, the Chief maintains the option 
to revise or modify the process at any time without consulting with, or obtaining the approval of 
any employee. In the event the Chief modifies or dissolves this process, any disciplinary hearing 
already scheduled will be handled under the provision(s) in place at the time it was scheduled. 
In the  event  the  Chief  exercises  discretionary  authority  to  modify  or  dissolve  this  process,  that 
decision is final. 

902.9.1   PHILOSOPHY AND GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE 
Progressive  discipline  is  a  process for responding  to  on-duty  and  off-duty  job related  behavior 
that does not meet expected and communicated performance standards. The primary purpose 
for progressive discipline is to assist the employee to understand that a performance problem or

Administrative Investigations 

opportunity  for  improvement  exists.  The  process  features  increasingly  formal  efforts  to  provide 
feedback to the employee so they can correct the problem. 

The goal of progressive discipline is to improve employee performance. Progressive discipline is 
most successful when it assists an individual in becoming an effectively  performing member of 
the organization. Failing that, progressive discipline enables the organization to fairly, and when 
appropriate, terminate employment. 

Development of the Discipline Process was based upon several guiding principles: 

(a)     To  provide  motivation  to  employees  to  respect  Departmental  values  and  adhere  to 

Department policies, procedures, rules, and regulations. 

(b)  To  encourage  and  maintain  expected  levels  of  performance  through  self  discipline  and 

acceptance of responsibility. 

(c)     To give employees a clear understanding of what is expected of them. 

(d)     To ensure that consequences for inappropriate behavior are clearly explained. 

(e)  To  ensure  that  a  consistent,  fair,  impartial,  objective,  timely,  and  unbiased  disciplinary 

process exists. 

(f) 

To  support  effective  law  enforcement  and  the  protection  of  civil  rights  as  complementary 
pillars for policing in partnership with the community we serve. 

(g)  To encourage and reinforce positive behavior by identifying and correcting poor employee 

performance through counseling, training, and/or discipline. 

(h)     To use discipline as a corrective action. 

902.9.2   DISCIPLINE LEVELS 
Additional  training  and counseling  or  evaluation  may  be  coupled  with  any  of  the below  options 
when  in  the  best  interest  of  the  Department  and/or  the  employee.  Changes  in  assignment  are 
at the discretion of the Chief or designee. Any change in assignment may be warranted when in 
the  best  interest  of the Department  and/or  employee.  All  types  of  progressive discipline  will  be 
classified as informal or formal discipline and will be documented in IA. 

(a)  Oral  Reprimand  -  A  formal  document  of  counseling  notifying  the  employee  that  a 
department policy has been violated. It may be issued for any misconduct that the supervisor 
determines is necessary and appropriate to correct the problem. The original is sent to IA 
and a copy is given to the employee. 

(b)  Written Reprimand - A formal letter of reprimand notifying the employee that a department 
policy  has  been  violated.  It  is  issued  for  any  misconduct  or  performance  in  which  the 
supervisor determines this level of discipline is necessary to correct the problem. Generally, 
written reprimands will be issued when there is a continuation of problems or a supervisor 
determines a onetime event is serious enough to warrant a written record being placed in 
the employee's file. The original is sent to IA and a copy is given to employee.

(c)  Temporary Suspension - These may range from a 1-3 day, 4-15 day or an agreed upon 
16-90 day suspension. When an employee receives a temporary suspension, the original 
suspension letter is sent to the Civil Service Commission; a copy shall go to the employee, 
be placed in the employee's IA file, and provided to APD-HR. A suspension may be given 
for any misconduct or performance problems as provided below:

3. 

1.

Progressive  disciplinary  measures  such  as  counseling,  oral  reprimands,  and/or 
written reprimands have not been successful in correcting performance or conduct 
problems, or would not be appropriate given the circumstances. A suspension in this 
case would be part of the progressive discipline process and shall range from 1-15 
days.  Previous  actions  need  not  have been for  the  same  violation in order  to use 
suspension as a corrective measure. A compilation of different issues will enable a 
supervisor to apply a disciplinary suspension. 

Progressive  disciplinary  measures,  including  lower  level  suspensions,  have  not 
corrected performance or conduct problems. 

The  involved  officer  must  agree  to  suspensions  of  16-90  days  in  lieu  of  indefinite 
suspension. 

(d)  Educational Based Discipline - An alternative to traditional suspensions offering optional 
behavior-focused education and training for suspension of 1 to 5 days at the determination 
of the Chain of Command. 

(e)  Demotion  Recommendation  -  A  recommendation  to  the  Civil  Service  Commission  of 
a  permanent  reduction  in  one  or  more  steps  in  rank.  The  same  guidelines  provided  in 
"Temporary Suspension" shall apply. This form of discipline may be used when a reduction 
is appropriate and will not transfer an irreconcilable problem to a different rank or grade. The 
demotion recommendation is sent to the Civil Service Commission; a copy shall go to the 
employee, placed in the employee's IA file, and provided to APD-HR. 

(f) 

Indefinite Suspension - Equivalent to dismissal or termination from the Department. When 
an  indefinite  suspension  occurs  the  original  suspension  letter  is  sent  to  the  Civil  Service 
Commission; a copy shall go to the employee, be placed in the employee's IA file, provided 
to APD-HR, and sent to the APD Training Academy. A termination may only occur with the 
approval and direction of the Chief as provided below: 

The occurrence of a onetime violation is listed in the attached Discipline Matrix as 
an Indefinite Suspension (IS) offense. 

Progressive disciplinary measures, including suspension, have not been successful 
in correcting performance or conduct problems, or retention of the employee would 
tend  to  bring  discredit  to  the  Department,  or  any  conduct  deemed  to  warrant 
dismissal by the Chief.

Confer Agreement and the Chief or designee.

902.9.3   FACTORS TO CONSIDER IN DETERMINING DISCIPLINE 
In determining proper discipline, it is recognized that similar discipline should normally be imposed 
for  similar  violations;  however,  equal  treatment  does  not  necessitate  identical  discipline.  The 
following noninclusive factors, if applicable to the particular case, should be considered, especially 
in those instances where more severe discipline is likely: 

(a)  The  nature  and  seriousness  of  the  violation  and  its  relationship  to  the  employee's  duties 

and responsibilities. 

(b)     Multiple violations. 

gain). 

(c)  The  employee's  motive  (e.g.,  intentional  act,  technical  mistake,  inadvertent,  or  personal 

(d)  Whether  the  employee's  actions  or  speech  involved  bias  or  discrimination  (the  treatment 
or consideration based on class or category rather than individual merit, driven by partiality 
or prejudice). 

(e)  Whether the employee is in a supervisory or management role (it is the Department's intent 
that individuals in a supervisory or management role will be held to a higher standard with 
regards to their conduct). 

(f)      The employee's past disciplinary and work record. 

(g)  The effect of the violation upon the Department's confidence in the employee's future job 

performance. 

(h)  Whether the officer's conduct has brought discredit to the Department. 

(i)  Whether the employee accepted responsibility for their actions. 

(j) 

The  consistency  of  the  discipline  with  those  imposed  upon  other  employees  for  a  similar 
offense and within the discipline matrix. 

(k)     The progressive nature of discipline. 

902.9.4   SUBSEQUENT CORRECTIVE ACTION 
The Discipline Matrix reflects increased levels of discipline for subsequent violations of the same 
or  similar  policies.  A  violation  is  considered  "subsequent"  if  it  occurs  within  36  months  of  the 
occurrence  date  of  the  last  violation.  Exceptions  are  those  more  serious  policy  violations  that 
result  in  suspensions  of  more  than  three  days,  or  those  involving  dangerous  conduct,  such 
as  accidental  discharge.  In  those  instances  any  past  violation  will  be  considered  a  previous 
occurrence. Additionally, an officer with a history of multiple unrelated violations within the previous 
36 month period may be subject to discipline outside the prescribed Matrix range. 

902.9.5   ADMINISTRATION OF DISCIPLINE 
After  an  investigation  has  been  completed  and  IA  has  issued  final  approval  on  any  sustained 
allegations,  the  commander  in  charge  shall  recommend  a  discipline  level  and,  if  applicable, 
the length of suspension. The commander in charge shall notify the employee of the specified

(b)  The length of the suspension recommended for sustained allegations. 

(c)  The  date/time  of  a  Discipline  Meeting  (for  15  days  or  less)  or  Dismissal 
Review Hearing (for more than 15 days, demotion or indefinite suspensions) 
at which the final disciplinary decision made by the Chief will be administered

902.9.6   DISCIPLINE MEETING 
Discipline Meetings (DM) are conducted for temporary suspensions of 1-15 days. 

(a) 

If an employee has received a Notice of Sustained Allegations to attend a DM they, and/ 
or their attorney or APA representative, has the right to provide a written response to the 
investigation directly to the commander in charge: 

1. 

2. 

3. 

4. 

2. 

3. 

The  written  response  must  be  in  the  form  of  a  Departmental  memorandum  or,  if 
submitted  by  the  attorney/APA  representative,  in  an  appropriate  letter  and  may 
contain  any  facts  or  evidence  the  subject  officer,  the  attorney/APA  representative 
deems pertinent to the investigation and discipline process. The memorandum/letter 
must be presented to the commander in charge no more than 5 calendar days after 
the Notice of Sustained Allegations is received by the subject officer. 

The   commander   in   charge   shall   forward   a   copy   of   any   written   response 
memorandum received to IA immediately upon receipt. 

The  commander  in  charge  shall  review  the  memorandum  and  may  consider  this 
information  when  deciding  whether  further  investigation  is  warranted  or  when 
determining the appropriate disciplinary recommendation. 

After  the  commander  in  charge  has  reviewed  the  subject  officer's  memorandum, 
the  commander  shall  notify  the  officer  of  the  outcome.  If,  based  on  the  review, 
the  commander  in  charge  determines  changes  should  be  made  to  the  Notice  of 
Sustained  Allegations,  they  shall  advise  the  subject  officer  that  disciplinary  action 
shall  be  imposed  at  the  scheduled  DM.  The  commander  in  charge  shall  make 
note  of  any  changes  on  the  original  Notice  of  Allegations  kept  in  the  case  file  for 
documentation purposes. 

(b) 

Independent Discipline Review Process 

1.  Officers may request an Independent Discipline Review of the proposed disciplinary 

action after being notified by the commander in charge of the DM. 

If  the  officer  does  not  request  an  Independent  Discipline  Review  the  DM  shall  be 
conducted  as  scheduled.  The  commander  in  charge  shall  notify  the  officer  of  the 
Chief's disciplinary decision. The commander in charge is responsible for ensuring 
that all relevant paperwork is completed. 

If  an  Independent  Discipline  Review  is  requested,  the  scheduled  DM  shall  not 
take place until after the Review has occurred, unless this Review will prohibit the 
Department from imposing disciplinary action within the 180-day statutory deadline.

Guidance Advisory Program 

906.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The Guidance Advisory Program (GAP) is an employee early warning system designed to give 
supervisors tools to manage their officers and proactively identify potential areas of concern before 
they lead to a more significant impact on the officer and/or Department. 

GAP  should  not  be  used  to  disseminate  any  form  of  discipline,  but  should  be  used  as  an 
opportunity  to  assess,  identify,  and  assist  an  officer  with  any  issue(s)  the  officer  may  be 
experiencing. 

906.2   INDICATORS FOR PERFORMANCE HISTORY AUDITS 
Performance  indicators  represent  the  categories  of  activity  that  have  been  determined  to  be 
relevant data for generation and analysis into a Performance History Audit. 

(a)     GAP tracks three (3) categories on all officers: 

1.  Use of sick leave - Use 160 hours or more in any 12 month period. 

2.  Complaints received by Internal Affairs - 

(a)  Level 1- A, Admin, B, C-- Two (2) or more per 12 month period

3.  Response to Resistance: 

(a)  Patrol related duties - Six (6) or more incidents per 12 month period. 

(b)  Non-Patrol related duties - Varies based on the assignment. 

906.3   NOTIFICATION AND RESPONSE 
Each quarter a Performance History Audit report will be run and verified by the Risk Management 
Unit.  If  an  officer  exceeds  the  established  threshold  for  any  one  of  the  tracked  categories,  the 
officer's immediate supervisor is notified. The supervisor may be required to meet with the officer. 
The officer should be notified they have exceeded the GAP threshold and allowed the opportunity 
to discuss any action or incidents related to the GAP activation. 

(a)     Prior to the meeting, supervisors may review: 

1.  Officer's use of sick leave. 

2.  Recent mobile video recording tapes. 

3.  Response to resistance reports or other Versadex reports. 

4. 

5. 

6. 

Activity logs. 

Internal Affairs complaint history. 

Secondary employment activity.

Memo, or any other action the officer's chain-of-command deems appropriate 

(c)  No follow-up action is necessary when the GAP thresholds are activated due to long term 

illness, approved Family Medical Leave, or incorrect data entered into the APD database. 

906.4   COMPLETION OF REVIEW 
Upon completing the review, supervisors may discuss their findings with the officer. 

(a)  Supervisors  will  write  a  memorandum  addressed  to  their  commander  to  document  the 
findings.  The  memorandum  should  be  signed  by  each  level  of  the  officer's  chain-of- 
command as it is routed to the commander. 

(b)  Commanders  will  review  the  GAP  memorandum  then  scan  and  email  it  to  the  GAP 
Coordinator for retention and any necessary follow-up. The original memorandum shall be 
retained by the officer's chain-of-command. 

(c) 

If an action plan is initiated, the GAP memorandum should include a date for the completion 
of the required action(s). 

906.5   CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA 
Information, data and copies of material compiled to develop Performance History Audits Reports 
shall be considered confidential as part of the employee's personnel file and will not be subject to 
discovery or release except as provided by law. Access to the data in the system will be governed 
under the same process as access to an officer's personnel file as outlined in Policy § 910 (Peace 
Officer Personnel Files). 

906.6   RETENTION AND PURGING 
Except as incorporated in separate training or disciplinary records, all performance indicators and 
Performance  History  Audit  Reports  shall  be  purged  from  the  Internal  Affairs  Unit  and  all  other 
locations within the Department one year from the date generated. The City Attorney however, 
shall  retain  a  copy  of  Performance  History  Audit  Reports  for  an  additional  one  year  period  as 
attorney work product.

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Reporting of Employee Arrests and Police 
Involvement 

908.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Arrests and convictions of certain offenses may restrict or prohibit an employee's ability to properly 
perform official duties. All employees shall report any arrest, charge, or indictment of a: 

(a)     Class B Misdemeanor offense or higher; or 

(b)     Class C Misdemeanor involving the duties and responsibilities of office. 

908.2   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CONVICTIONS AND RESTRAINING ORDERS 
Texas and federal law prohibit individuals convicted of certain offenses and individuals subject to 
certain court orders from lawfully possessing a firearm. Such convictions and court orders often 
involve allegations of the use or attempted use of force or threatened use of a weapon on any 
individual in a domestic relationship (e.g., spouse, cohabitant, parent, child (18 USC § 922; Tex. 
Penal Code § 46.04(b); Tex. Penal Code § 46.04(c)). 

All employees are responsible for ensuring that they have not been disqualified from possessing 
a firearm by any such conviction or court order and shall promptly report any such conviction or 
court order to a supervisor, as provided in this policy. 

908.2.1   EMPLOYEE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
The Department's position is one of zero tolerance toward domestic violence. It is the policy of the 
Department to use early prevention strategies in order to avoid or minimize the occurrence and 
effects of domestic violence. This policy addresses the dynamics of domestic violence and how it 
impacts the employee and the Department. The purpose of this policy is to heighten awareness 
of domestic violence and provide guidance for employees, supervisors, and management. 

(a)  The  policy  takes  a  continuum  approach,  seeking  first  to  educate  at  all  phases  of  an 
employee's career, then prevent or intervene in domestic abuse situations in order to reduce 
victimization of the family member or partner and increase the chances of employee career 
stability. 

(b)  The Department will respect the confidentiality and autonomy of its employees to direct their 
own lives, to the fullest extent permitted by state law. The Department will provide assistance 
to employees, which may include, but is not limited to: 

1.  Resource and referral information; and 

2. 

Safety plans for the workplace; and 

3.  Work schedule adjustment or leave necessary to obtain medical, counseling, or legal 

assistance and arrange for housing and child care; and 

4.  Workplace relocation.

908.2.2   PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION OF EMPLOYEE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 

(a)     The goal of the Department is to accomplish the following in regard to domestic violence: 

1.  Heighten awareness. 

Provide guidance for employees, supervisors, and management. 

Identify warning signs. 

Establish prevention and intervention guidelines. 

(b) 

In  order  to  provide  non-punitive  avenues  of  assistance  to  employees,  their  partners,  and 
other family members before an act of domestic violence occurs, the Department will provide 
confidential referrals to reputable internal or external counseling services. 

(c)  Employees with knowledge of suspected abuse or violence involving another employee of 

the Department shall report it to their immediate supervisor. 

(d)  Supervisors will monitor employees for warning signs of domestic violence. If warning signs 
exist, intervention measures must be taken. The following are some examples of steps that 
can be taken, based on the level of violence and the likelihood of recurrence: 

1. 

Problem   solving   meeting   with   both   parties   conducted   by   the   Department's 
Psychological Services. 

2.  Mediation. 

3.  Referral to counseling services for emotional support and guidance: 

(a) 

Internal (e.g., APD Peer Support, Wellness Office, Victim Services). 

(b)  External (insurance coverage). 

(c)  Employee Assistance Program (city benefits). 

4.  Referral to Family Violence Protection Team for assistance with protective orders. 

5.  Develop a safety/prevention plan with the assistance of counseling services. 

Arrange for temporary reassignment to avoid further contact. 

Issue directive to restrict contact with the other party. 

Liberal  use  of  employees  accumulated  existing  leave  time  up  to  and  including 
approved Administrative Leave. 

908.3   OTHER CRIMINAL OFFENSES 
State  law  prohibits  any  person  convicted  of a felony  from  being  a peace  officer  in the  State of 
Texas. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the guilt was established by way of a verdict, 
guilty plea or nolo contendre plea.

Reporting of Employee Arrests and Police Involvement 

Convictions  of  certain  violations  of  the  Texas  Transportation  Code  (e.g.,  suspended  drivers 
license) and other provisions of law may also place restrictions on an employee's ability to fully 
perform the duties of the job. 

Moreover, while legal restrictions may or may not be imposed by statute or by the courts upon 
conviction  of  any  criminal  offense,  criminal  conduct  by  members  of  this  department  may  be 
inherently in conflict with law enforcement duties and the public trust. 

908.3.1   TELECOMMUNICATORS 
Any person who has been convicted of a felony offense or convicted of barratry as defined by 
Tex. Penal Code § 38.12 may not be a telecommunicator in the State of Texas (Tex. Occ. Code § 
1701.312; Tex. Occ. Code § 1701.313). In addition, telecommunicators are held to the statutory 
standards outlined in 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 217.2 with regard to certain misdemeanor offenses. 

908.4   REPORTING PROCEDURE 

(a)  Employees who are arrested will inform the booking officer they are employed by APD and 

request APD Communications be immediately notified of the arrest. 

(b)  Employees  shall  immediately  report  to  their  supervisor,  with  a  follow-up  memorandum 

through the chain-of-command to the Chief, of: 

1. 

2. 

Any  arrests,  criminal  charges,  and/or  criminal  court  actions  brought  against  the 
employee (to include the name of the arresting agency, a description of the nature 
of the charges, and the style, court and cause number of the charge or indictment, 
if any); or 

Anytime  an  employee  is  involved  in  an  off-duty  incident  that results  in  a response 
from  any  law  enforcement  agency  with  the  exception  of  traffic  violations,  minor 
collisions, and other minor calls for service where the employee is not considered to 
be a suspect (e.g. alarm calls, noise complaints); or 

3. 

Anytime  an  employee  becomes  the  subject  of  a  family  violence  protective  order 
issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. 

(c)  Supervisors   receiving   such   information   shall   immediately   notify   the   Internal   Affairs 
Commander,  with  a  follow-up  memorandum  through  the  chain-of-command  to  Internal 
Affairs, detailing the circumstances of the situation. 

(d)  Employees who receive a criminal conviction which unduly restricts or prohibits them from 
fully and properly performing their duties may be disciplined up to and including indefinite 
suspension/termination. 

(e)     Employees failing to provide prompt notice pursuant to this policy are subject to discipline.

908.4.1   DEPARTMENT RESPONSIBILITY TO REPORT 
When a peace officer or county jailer is arrested, the Chief of Police of the arresting agency must 
report such fact, as mandated by 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 211.28, to TCOLE within 30 business 
days of the arrest. 

In addition, the Chief of Police must report the arrest, charge or conviction of any person who is 
under appointment with this department to TCOLE within 30 days of the arrest, as mandated by 
37 Tex. Admin. Code § 211.29. 

908.4.2   OFFICER RESPONSIBILITY TO REPORT 
Any officer employed by the Department must report any arrest, charge or indictment for a criminal 
offense above the grade of a Class C misdemeanor, or for any Class C misdemeanor involving 
the duties and responsibilities of office or family violence to TCOLE within 30 days as mandated 
by 37 Tex. Admin. Code § 211.27. In addition, an officer must report any of the above mentioned 
arrest, charge, or indictment for a criminal offense to the Austin Police Department. 

908.5   PROCEDURE FOR RELIEF 
While a peace officer may be permitted to carry a firearm following a conviction under state law, 
federal law does not provide for any similar relief, and therefore the peace officer is not relieved 
of  the  restrictions  imposed  by  federal  law.  Pending  satisfactory  proof  of  relief  from  any  legal 
restriction imposed on an employee's duties, the employee may be placed on administrative leave, 
reassigned or disciplined.

910.7   BRADY MATERIAL IN PERSONNEL FILES 
The  purpose  of  this  section  is  to  establish  a  procedure  for  releasing  potentially  exculpatory 
information, known as Brady material, contained within confidential peace officer personnel files. 

910.7.1   DEFINITIONS 
Brady  material  -  In  the  Brady  v.  Maryland  decision  (373  U.S.  83  (1963))  the  United  States 
Supreme  Court  held  that  the  prosecution  has  an  affirmative  duty  to  disclose  to  the  defendant 
evidence which is both favorable and material to the guilt and/or punishment of the defendant. 

The prosecution - Refers to any prosecuting attorney and all investigative agencies involved in 
the criminal prosecution of a defendant, including this department. 

910.7.2   RELEASE OF PERSONNEL FILES TO PROSECUTING ATTORNEY 
Generally, the only time the prosecuting attorney, Attorney General or Grand Jury is entitled to 
access  confidential  peace  officer  personnel  files  without  filing  a  court  motion  is  when  they  are 
investigating the conduct of an officer or this department. Such access shall not be considered a 
waiver of the confidentiality of the information contained in these files. 

Absent a specific investigation of identified officer(s) or a specific investigation of this department, 
or the consent of an involved officer, no confidential information from any officer's personnel file 
shall be released to the prosecuting attorney or Grand Jury without full compliance with the court 
process. The prosecution of a criminal defendant is not considered an investigation of any involved 
officer. 

Should an officer's credibility or other issues related to an officer's personnel file arise in the context 
of an officer acting as a witness for the prosecution, access to that officer's personnel file by either 
the prosecuting attorney or the criminal defendant shall be limited to that which is authorized by 
the process set forth in court and evidentiary rules. 

910.7.3   PROCEDURE 
If an officer is a material witness in a criminal case, a person or persons designated by the Chief 
of Police may examine the subject officer's personnel file to determine whether there are Brady 
materials contained therein (e.g., evidence which is both favorable and material to the guilt and/ 
or punishment of the defendant). If Brady material is located, the following procedure shall apply: 

(a) 

In the event that a court motion has not already been filed by the criminal defendant or other 
party, the prosecuting attorney shall be notified of the potential presence of Brady material 
in the officer's personnel file. 

(b)  The prosecuting attorney should be encouraged to file a court motion in order to initiate an 

in-camera review by the court. 

(c)     As with any court motion, and prior to any review of the files by the court, subject officer(s) 

shall be notified in writing that a court motion has been filed.

(d)  The  Central  Records  Manager  or  authorized  designee  shall  accompany  all  relevant 
personnel files during any in-camera inspection, and address any issues or questions raised 
by the court in determining whether any material contained in the file is both material and 
favorable to the criminal defendant. 

(e) 

If the court determines that there is relevant Brady material contained in the file(s), only that 
material ordered released will be copied and released to the parties filing the court motion. 

1. 

Prior to the release of any materials pursuant to this process, the Central Records 
Manager or designee should forward the request to the City Attorney to evaluate the 
need for a protective order from the court limiting the use of such materials to the 
involved case and requiring the return of all copies upon completion of the case.

Personnel Evaluations 

912.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
Performance appraisal should be a continuous process done by supervisors for each employee 
under  their  command.  Appraisals  assist  in  making  the  best  use  of  human  resources,  ensure 
that  personnel  problems  are  identified  and  dealt  with  promptly  and  appropriately,  and  help  the 
employee reach optimum performance and job satisfaction. 

Nothing in this policy negates the Department's right to immediately take appropriate corrective 
action when deficient behavior is observed and/or discipline an employee for poor performance. 

Performance - Issues related to the employee’s knowledge, skills and/or abilities. These are issues 
that the employee may improve to a satisfactory level of performance given additional training, 
time, and/or other resources. Performance Issues may be addressed by an Employee Success 
Plan. 

Conduct  -  Issues  related  to  the  employee’s  behavior,  attitude,  and/or  the  manner  in  which  his 
or  her  duties  are  accomplished.  These  are  issues  covered  by  policies  and  standard  operating 
procedures. The employee should be able to correct these issues immediately with little assistance 
from the supervisor. Conduct Issues may be addressed by a Conduct Counseling Memo. 

912.2   POLICY 
The evaluation system used by the Department is subject to periodic change and may be different 
for  sworn  and  non-sworn  employees.  The  system  will  provide  evaluation  of  performance  as  it 
relates to, and supports, the Department's goals and objectives. The Department utilizes the City’s 
Success Strategy Performance Review (SSPR) process for all employees. 

(a)     Employees will only use the approved evaluation system. 

(b)     The SSPR form must be specific to the employee's assignment during the evaluation period. 

(c)     Evaluations will cover a specified period of time. 

912.3   EVALUATION FREQUENCY 

(a)     Written performance evaluations will be conducted with the following frequencies: 

1. 

Swor 
n Employees 
 

(a) 

 

 

 
 

Officers assigned to the FTO program will be evaluated as designated by the 
FTO program. 

(b)  Officers  who  have  graduated  the  FTO  program  will  be  evaluated  annually 
with  monthly  performance  counseling  sessions  being  conducted  by  the 
supervisor.

should consider whether a reasonable person in the victims place would consider the conduct to 
be inappropriate. 

Supervisors and managers shall be aware of the following considerations: 

(a)  Behavior of supervisors and managers should represent the values of the Department and 

professional law enforcement standards.

the Chief. 

(c)  All  complaints  of  discrimination/harassment  involving  civilian  employees  will  be  reviewed 

and/or investigated according to City Personnel Policy.

organizational levels do not use prohibited drugs or inhalants, abuse controlled substances, 
or abuse prescription or over-the-counter medications, due to the sensitive nature of their 
assignments. In these assignments, the strictest precautionary safeguards are necessary to 
provide for a drug-free working environment, and to ensure that there are no drug abusers 
or  controlled substance abusers  who  jeopardize the  safety  of fellow  officers  and  citizens. 
All sworn members who apply for or are assigned to the following divisions/bureaus will be 
subject to additional drug testing: 

1.  Organized Crime Division 

Special Operations Division 

Professional Standards Bureau 

2. 

3. 

4. 

Any other assignment (s) that the Chief of Police or his designee determines by SOP 
should be subject to additional random drug testing. 

(b)  Sworn members assigned to these units may be randomly tested up to a maximum of three 
times  per  calendar  year.  This  additional  testing  is  separate  and  distinct  from  the  random 
testing that every sworn member of the Department is subject to pursuant to this policy and 
the Meet and Confer Contract. 

916.5   REASONABLE SUSPICION TESTING FOR SWORN EMPLOYEES 

(a)  The  Chief,  an  assistant  chief,  the  Duty  Commander,  the  DTC,  and  authorized  designees 

have the authority to order officers to submit to a drug test. 

(b)  The  Department may  require  drug  testing  of  officers  when  a  determination  of reasonable 

suspicion is agreed upon by any two (2) supervisors. 

916.5.1   CONDITIONS FOR REASONABLE SUSPICION TESTING 
Reasonable suspicion must be based on facts or circumstances that lead a supervisor to believe 
the employee may: 

(a)  Be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 

(b)  Currently have or had possession of drugs either on- or off-duty, or on or off City premises. 

(c)  Have been associated with or involved with others who were using or under the influence 
of  drugs,  or  who  were  in  possession  of  same.  Such  association  or  involvement  was  not 
authorized or required in connection with any law enforcement duty, under circumstances 
which  reasonably  indicate  participation  or  complicity  with,  or  protection  of  such  other 
individuals.

916.7   SAMPLE COLLECTION AND RESULTS REPORTING PROCEDURES 
Collection of the necessary samples and analysis will be conducted by a contracted firm/laboratory 
certified  by  the  National  Institute  of  Drug  Abuse  (NIDA).  Scientifically  accepted  screening  and 
confirmation  tests  will  be  employed  in  the  analysis  of  the  collected  samples.  After  arriving  at 
the  specified  collection  location,  officers  will  comply  with  instructions  received  from  screening 
personnel. Screening will only be done for prohibited drugs and/or alcohol. 

(a)  When a drug test is required of employees, it will be collected by a vendor contracted with 
by the City or a person selected by the Chief or DTC who is qualified to administer such a 
test. Any employee involved in the collection of samples shall be trained in collection and 
chain of custody protocols. 

1.  Drug test samples from police cadet applicants will be collected by the contracted 

vendor. The vendor will deliver the samples to the laboratory for testing. 

(b)     Collection dates for random testing will not be announced in advance. 

(c)     Three (3) samples of hair will be collected for hair follicle testing. Samples collected will be:

2. 

3. 

Taken from the  same  body  area,  preferably  the  head  or face,  or  if  necessary  the 
body. Samples will not be taken from the pubic area. 

If an employee does not have sufficient head, face, or body hair, then a nail sample 
from the fingers or toes will be taken for analysis. 

(d)  Sample  collections  for  all  tests  administered  by  the  contracting  vendor  will  be  taken  in 
accordance  with  the  procedures  established  by  the  vendor.  Officers  will  be  required  to 
present a valid driver's license and APD identification card at the collection location. 

(e)  Officers summoned to provide a specimen for analysis will remain at the collection location 
in view of collection personnel until an adequate sample can be produced. The samples will 
be provided in feasible privacy. 

(f)  Drug test results acquired by the DTC as a result of employment are the property of APD 
and copies will not be made available to employees; however, both positive and negative 
results will be communicated to the officer who submitted the sample. 

916.7.1   POSITIVE TEST RESULTS 

(a) 

If the initial screening indicates a positive test result, a second test of this specimen will be 
performed. 

1. 

A confirmed positive report will only be made after this second test also comes back 
positive.

2. 

A confirmed positive test report will be maintained by the DTC in a secure area. 

(b)  Once the DTC has received the initial notification from the drug-testing vendor that an officer 
has a positive test result, the DTC will notify a supervisor in the officer's immediate chain- 
of-command. 

1. 

Employees shall be placed on Restricted Duty pending final review and disposition 
which will be made, if possible, within thirty (30) calendar days of the date the positive 
test result was reported to the DTC. 

2.  Within eight (8) hours after receiving notification from their chain-of-command of an 
initial positive test result, officers will have the opportunity, at their own expense, to 
provide a urine sample to their private physician. 

3. 

In  order  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  sample  and  the  testing  process,  personnel 
from the drug-testing vendor will accompany the officer to the physician's office. The 
sample must be submitted by the physician for analysis to a firm/laboratory certified 
by the NIDA.

Verified, confirmed, positive test results in random drug testing are for administrative 
purposes only and will not be used against officers in any criminal proceeding. 

(c)  Officers may request the urine sample be stored in case of legal disputes. The urine sample 
will be submitted to the designated testing facility where a sample will be maintained for a 
period of one (1) year. 

916.8   STORAGE OF TESTING RECORDS 
Drug test documentation, other than disciplinary reports, shall be maintained in a secured cabinet 
in the office of the DTC. A separate, confidential file will be maintained for each employee who 
submits to drug testing.

Policy Manual

 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Drug and Alcohol Abuse and Treatment 

917.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The  Austin  Police  Department  encourages  any  employee  who  has  an  alcohol  or  other  drug 
problem to seek treatment before the problem manifests itself into a violation of Department policy. 

917.2   ALCOHOL USE AND ABUSE 
The  Department  recognizes  alcoholism  as  an  illness  which  can  be  effectively  treated.  Early 
recognition of alcohol abuse and problem drinking increases the chances for successful recovery 
before serious personal or professional problems occur. 

(a)  Drinking alcohol by adults is a widely practiced social activity which does not violate any law 
and is often considered a natural part of participating in group recreational activities. As a 
result, there is more social pressure to drink than to be disciplined in drinking. 

(b)  Because  of  its  short-term  numbing  effects,  alcohol  is  also  used  to  relax  and  to  manage 
mental stress and emotional pain. As a result, people can develop a dependence on alcohol 
to relax or to avoid the discomfort of stressful living. 

917.2.1   IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEM DRINKING 
When  employees'  drinking  interferes  with  their  work  responsibilities  and/or  personal  life,  they 
should be encouraged to seek professional assistance. This would be to assess the nature of the 
drinking habit and to begin practicing the discipline of moderate drinking or abstention. 

(a)     Some of the early signs of problem drinking include, but are not limited to: 

1. 

Poor attendance at work. 

2.  Off-duty disturbances involving alcohol. 

3. 

Increased social drinking. 

4.  Drinking alone or in isolation. 

Friends or family suggesting to reduce drinking. 

Looking forward to drinking at certain times or the day or week. 

A reliance on alcohol to relax or socialize more comfortably. 

Knowingly make excuses for excessive drinking. 

5. 

6. 

7. 

8. 

9. 

Arranging your weekly schedule around partying or drinking so as to have plenty of 
time to sleep it off or get over the hangover.

regardless  of  their  status  with  respect  to  alcohol  issues  (e.g.,  identification  of  a  drinking 
problem, treatment program, recovery process). 

917.3.2   SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES 

(a)  Supervisors are expected to be alert to signs that an employee may have a drinking problem. 
The supervisor will review the problem behavior with the employee, encourage the employee 
to seek voluntary assistance, and make a mandatory referral for professional assessment 
when appropriate. 

(b)  Scheduling arrangements should be made for the employee to utilize accrued sick leave or 

personal leave to obtain assistance. 

(c)  Supervisors should avoid accepting chronic excuses for problem drinking. 

917.4   VOLUNTARY ASSISTANCE AND TREATMENT 

(a)  All professional counselors, both within the Department and in private practice, are ethically 

required to keep confidential the names of people who are receiving voluntary treatment.

2.

assistance from: 

(a)  APD employees who are: 

1. 

Trained Peer Support employees. 

2.  Chaplains. 

3.  Recovering alcoholics. 

(b)  APD Psychological Services staff members.

(d)  Private treatment programs. 

(c)  An employees voluntary disclosure of an alcohol or legal drug problem before submitting to 
a drug test or being requested to submit to a drug test may be considered by the Chief as a 
mitigating factor should the facts warrant the matter being handled as a disciplinary issue.

917.5   REFERRAL FOR ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT 

(a)  Employees who are identified by supervisors because of disciplinary problems or off-duty 

incidents shall: 

1. 

Be referred to the Department Psychological Services Unit which will coordinate the 
assessment, treatment and follow-up program with an outside professional treatment 
center; and 

2.  Will not have confidentiality because of the Department's responsibility to follow-up 

on problem behavior. 

(b)  Upon  completion  of  the  recommended  treatment  program,  the  affected  employee  shall 
obtain  a  letter  from  the  treatment  staff  confirming  that  the  employee  has  completed  the 
recommended  treatment.  That  letter  will  be  forwarded  through  Psychological  Services  to 
the employees' chain-of-command. 

917.6   TREATMENT FOLLOW-UP 

(a)  To prevent relapses into problem drinking, it is often useful to establish new support networks 
such as joining an Alcoholics Anonymous group, obtaining a sponsor, or meeting regularly 
with  other  recovering  problem  drinkers.  In  some  cases,  the  treatment  center  staff  will 
recommend random urine testing to reinforce the habit of not drinking. 

(b)  The  Department  will  expect  employees  with  drinking  problems  to  complete  whatever 

treatment follow-up is recommended by the outside treatment center staff. 

(c) 

In cases where the employee is referred by a supervisor for problem drinking, completion 
of any follow-up program will be documented by the treatment center staff and sent to the 
employee's supervisor. 

917.7   VOLUNTARY REHABILITATION PROGRAM 
These guidelines apply only to one requested leave of absence. Any request for additional leave 
of absence under the Voluntary Rehabilitation Program will be handled on a case-by-case basis 
and granted only at the sole discretion of the Chief or designee, and as required by law. The return 
to work agreement should be prepared by the affected employee's immediate supervisor, and a 
copy of this agreement should be sent to the DTC. 

(a)  An  employee  who  is  being  treated  for  a  legal  drug  or  alcohol  problem  may  be  placed  on 
unpaid  medical  leave  of  absence;  however,  some  or  all  of  the  leave  of  absence  may  be 
substituted with paid leave accrued by the employee. 

(b)  While  on  such  leave  the  employee  will  be  subject  to  all  APD  policies  and  procedures 

governing such leaves of absence. 

(c)     Nothing in this policy is intended to conflict with the provisions of the Family and Medical 
Leave Act (FMLA), and in the case of any conflict, the provisions of the FMLA prevail.

Vacancy and Transfer Guidelines for Sworn 
Employees 

918.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The  purpose  of  this  policy  is  to  set  guidelines  for  posting  and  filling  of  vacancies  for  all  sworn 
employees up to and including the rank of commander. While the proper staffing of all positions 
is  a  prime  concern,  it  is also  desirable  to maintain a  certain  level  of  stability  in  assignments of 
personnel to particular workgroups. Although not mutually exclusive, at times both objectives may 
not  be  simultaneously  achievable.  Occasions  will  arise  when  deviations  from  the  norm  will  be 
required in order to meet the needs of the Department. 

918.1.1   AUTHORITY 
The Chief has ultimate authority over all transfers and reserves the right to bypass provisions of 
this policy if it is in the best interest of the Department. The Chief may delegate his authority for 
transfer issues to an appropriate assistant chief or commander. 

918.2   DEFINITIONS 
Initial Vacancy - A vacancy created based upon a promotion or by the separation of an employee 
from APD (e.g., retirement, resignation, termination). 

Vacancy in the Near Future - A vacancy which will occur within fourteen (14) calendar days after 
the vacancy posting. 

Hardship - A situation that an employee experiences because of a specific work assignment and 
which causes unusual stress, an uncomfortable working relationship, or causes an employee to 
be mentally distracted from optimal performance of duty or attention to duty. 

918.3   GENERAL GUIDELINES 

(a)     Assistant chief and commander assignments will be at the discretion of the Chief. 

(b)  Lieutenant  assignments  will  be  made  by  the  commanders  with  the  concurrence  of  the 

affected assistant chiefs and approved by the Chief. 

(c)  Sergeant, corporal, detective, and officer assignments will be governed by this policy. 

(d)  Officers normally will be assigned to patrol while still on probation. 

(e)     The   Chief   may   appoint   employees   to   assignments   in   Internal   Affairs,   the   Special 

Investigations Unit, and Training. 

(f)  A newly promoted employee, other than commander, will not generally be assigned within 

the same unit they were assigned to immediately prior to a promotion. 

1. 

A  newly  promoted  employee  awaiting  an  assignment  may  be  placed  within  his 
current  command  with  a  person  of  equal  rank  in  order  to  begin  learning  the 
responsibilities of the rank.

An employee's regular day off and/or living outside the city limits of Austin are not 
valid reasons for being unavailable for any subpoena. 

Approved  leave,  in-service  training,  and/or  supervisor  approval  alone  does  not 
relieve  an  employee  from  attending  court;  employees  must  complete the  required 
documentation and request to be excused. 

Employees  are  responsible  for  confirming  whether  they  have  been  excused  from 
court; this can be done by contacting a Court Liaison . 

If the employee suffers an illness or injury that prevents appearing in court as directed 
by a previously served subpoena, the employee shall, at least one hour before the 
appointed  date  and  time,  inform  the  Court  Liaison  of  the  situation.  It  shall  be  the

for requesting an absence from court and shall include the applicable date range the 
employee is unavailable. 

(a)  Declining a subpoena notice does not release the employee from complying 
with  the  subpoena;  it  is  simply  a  request  made  to  the  court  to  be  excused 
from appearing on the date indicated in the subpoena. 

(b)  Employees are responsible for confirming with a Court Liaison whether they 

have been excused from court.

supplemental income, it is imperative to maintain an agency in which its employees are physically 
fit and mentally alert. Additionally, the appearance of impropriety must be avoided. The Chief, or 
designee, reserves the right to approve, deny, revoke, add restrictions or allow exemptions to any 
provision of this policy.

individual  or  business  other  than  the  Austin  Police  Department,  either  law  enforcement 
related or non-law enforcement related. 

Law Enforcement Related Employment (LERE) - Any secondary employment that is 
conditioned on the actual or potential use of law enforcement powers by the officer 
(e.g., private security contracts). 

2.  Non-Law   Enforcement   Related   Employment   (Non-LERE)   -   Any   secondary 
employment that is not conditioned on the actual or potential use of law enforcement 
powers by the off-duty employee (e.g., lawn care business, real estate agent).

Involves an assembly of 100 or more individuals at a city facility, other than the Austin 
Convention Center, Long Center, or Palmer Events Center; 

Impedes, obstructs, impairs, or interferes with normal vehicular or pedestrian traffic

949.5.5   MOTOR VEHICLE ESCORT GUIDES 
This  section  applies  to  officers  working  LERE  assignments  as  Motor  Vehicle  Escort  Guides. 
Supervisory  requirements  outlined  in  949.5.2(b)(2)  apply  to  this  section.  This  section  does  not 
apply to motor vehicle escorts provided by on-duty personnel. 

(a)     Officers working as a Motor Vehicle Escort Guide will: 

1.  Use personally owned motorcycles that are equipped as prescribed in Austin City 

Code Volume 1, Title VIII, Chapter 8-15-1. 

2.  Maintain the motorcycle in proper working order with current registration and Motor 

Vehicle Inspection.

minimum  limits  of  $100,000  bodily  injury  per  person/$300,000  bodily  injury  per 
accident and $100,000 property damage. 

4.  Wear an APD Patrol or Motor Officers' uniform. 

(b)  The use of amplified electronic horns is authorized for officer safety purposes; however, the

(c)  Oversize  load  escorts  include  but  are  not  limited  to  wide  loads,  oversized  loads,  house 
moves, and industrial equipment. When conducting escorts for oversized loads the officer 
will  ensure  that  all  necessary  permits  have  been  obtained from  the Texas  Department of 
Transportation and will abide by the route set out in the permit. The officer will not escort 
any vehicle if the officer has reason to believe it is not in a safe operating condition. 

(d)  On occasion the size of a funeral procession may require additional officers to be utilized to 
provide a safe escort. In the interest of safety, off-duty officers may request assistance from 
the on-duty patrol supervisor to assist with an escort if call load allows. 

(e)  The  Department  understands  that  there  are  occasions  where  the  escort  officers  need  to 
travel beyond the city limits of Austin to provide for the safety of those in or around the vehicle 
procession or oversize load vehicles. The following exceptions to this policy will apply: 

1.  Officers  engaging  in  motor  vehicle  escorts  will  be  allowed  to  conduct  the  escorts 

within the boundaries of Hays, Travis and Williamson Counties. 

2. 

If  the  escort  begins  within  10  miles  of  the  city  limits  of  Austin,  the  escort  must 
terminate inside the city limits.

protect life and property, assist the citizen in contacting 911 for an on-duty 
officer) to any citizen requesting assistance for incidents that have occurred, 
or that are occurring, off the property of the LERE assignment.

Incidents originating on the property of the LERE work location. 

(a)  Officers  will  immediately  report  any  incident  or  situation  arising  from  or 
connected with the LERE assignment in the same regard as if on-duty. This 
includes completing  all paperwork  related  to  an incident  (e.g.,  original  and/ 
or supplementary reports, associated forms and documents, evidence tags, 
impound forms). 

(b)  When an officer is the victim of an incident or the incident is of such a nature 
that  an  immediate  extensive  investigation  would  be  required  (e.g.,  murder, 
rape, robbery), an on-duty unit will be called. 

(b)  Arrest Guidelines 

1. 

LERE officers making arrests for incidents connected with the LERE assignment will 
complete an incident report and, if necessary, a probable cause affidavit following 
normal arrest reporting procedures and will:

(a) 

Incident reports initiated by the LERE officer not pertaining to custody arrests will be 
turned in by the LERE officer at any substation within 24 hours. 

(b)  Officers  writing  an  incident  report  that  requires  immediate  entry,  such  as  a 
misdemeanor  citation  or  custody  arrest,  shall  ensure  the  report  is  entered  into 
Versadex before the end of their LERE assignment. 

(d)  Nothing in this document prohibits an officer working a LERE assignment from calling for 

assistance from on-duty personnel. 

(e) 

If  prior to the  end  of the  LERE  assignment  it  becomes  apparent to the  officer that  he  will 
not be able to complete all duties required by the Department in connection with the use of 
his law enforcement powers (e.g. completing reports, transporting persons or property), the 
officer will immediately contact the on-duty patrol lieutenant responsible for the area where 
the LERE assignment is located. The officer will be required to provide the lieutenant with 
an explanation regarding why they are unable to complete the required duties prior to the 
end of the LERE assignment. 

(a) 

(b) 

If the patrol lieutenant determines the duties can wait until the officer's next regularly 
scheduled shift, the officer will be released. It is the officer's responsibility to ensure 
the required duties are completed prior to the end of their next shift when released 
by a lieutenant. 

If the patrol lieutenant determines that the duties must be completed without delay 
at the conclusion of the LERE assignment, the lieutenant will authorize overtime and 
the time  spent  completing  the  required  duties  will  be  counted  as  productive hours 
during that work week. 

(f) 

If  an  officer  is  working  a  LERE  assignment  and  takes  law  enforcement  action  during  the 
time he is being compensated by the LERE employer, the officer will not be compensated 
by the City for those hours, nor will those hours be included as productive hours during the 
officer's work week.

950.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
It  is  the  policy  of  the  Department  to  compensate  non-exempt  employees  who  work  authorized 
overtime either by payment of wages or by allowing the accrual of compensatory time off. In order 
to qualify for either, the employee must complete and submit a Request for Overtime Payment as 
soon as practicable after overtime is worked. 

950.1.1   DEFINITIONS 
Callback  -  Employees  in  non-exempt  positions  may  receive  compensation  as  established  by

of overtime pay. The maximum amount of compensatory time that an employee may accumulate 
is 120 hours.

Standards  Act.  Non-exempt  employees  will  receive  overtime  pay  or  compensatory  time  for 
productive hours worked in excess of 40 in a work week. 

On-Call - A period of time outside of normally scheduled working hours during which an employee 
must remain fit for duty and available to return to work. 

Productive Time (Civilian Personnel) - Established by City Personnel Policy.

purposes of computing overtime or compensatory time, all approved paid leave other than sick 
leave shall be calculated as hours worked. 

950.2   DEPARTMENT POLICY 

(a)  Employees may be required to work beyond regularly scheduled hours or be called back to 

active duty at any time in order to meet the operational needs of the Department. 

(b)  Employees who refuse to work overtime or fail to report back to work when ordered to do 

so will be subject to disciplinary action. 

(c)  Supervisors may adjust an employee's regularly scheduled hours so that no more than 40 

productive hours are worked in a particular week. 

(d)  Unless  otherwise  specified  by  the  assignment,  employees  in  non-exempt  positions  may 
choose  overtime  pay  or  compensatory  time  for  productive  hours  in  excess  of  40  in  a 
workweek.

951.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for handling temporary assignments in a higher 
rank classification and the associated pay differential for such assignments. 

951.2   STATUTORY AUTHORITY 

(a)  The  Chief  of  Police  may  authorize  the  designation  of  a  person  from  the  next  lower 
classification to temporarily fill a position in a higher classification (Tex. Local Gov't Code 
§ 143.038). 

(b)  The designated person is entitled to the base salary of the higher position plus the person's 
own longevity  or  seniority  pay,  educational  incentive pay,  and certification pay  during the 
time the person performs the duties, even if the temporary position lasts only one (1) day. 

(c)  Temporary designations will not be made for periods of less than one day unless approved 

by a Commander or above. 

951.3   PROCEDURES 
If a sworn supervisor will be absent for an entire day or longer (e.g., vacation, sick leave, FMLA 
leave, injury leave, training), the next higher supervisor in the chain-of-command is authorized to 
designate an officer to temporarily serve as an acting supervisor. 

(a)     The consideration should be based on the following criteria: 

If it is in the best interests of the Department for an acting supervisor to be temporarily 
assigned. 

If there is another on-duty supervisor who can assume the supervisory duties within 
the Department's established span of control. 

(b) 

In order to initiate pay differential, a "Pay Differential Assignment Form" must be completed 
by the employee's supervisor and submitted to the APD-HR office. 

(c)     The calculation for pay differential is based on years of service with the Department. 

Employees will be compensated as if they were at the higher rank with the same 
years of service. 

If  years  of  service  do  not  equal  the  minimum  number  of  years  required  before 
attaining the higher rank, the base salary of that rank will be used for the calculations. 

(d)  A sworn officer who works overtime while temporarily filling in for a higher classification, and 
who is eligible for overtime pay, shall be paid overtime at the appropriate rate as calculated 
by APD HR.

The  purpose  of  this  policy  is  to  provide  guidelines  for  compensation  for  designated  skills  and 
education.  Officers  who  have  demonstrated  their  proficiency  in  designated  skills  and  who  are 
subsequently authorized may receive assignment pay in amounts provided by the current Meet 
and Confer Agreement. 

953.2   BILINGUAL PAY 
In order to be eligible for bilingual pay, officers must successfully pass an established bilingual 
test reflecting the types of bilingual communication in which officers would normally be required 
to engage during the course and scope of duty. 

(a)  Eligible   officers   accepting   bilingual   pay   will   be   required   to   utilize   their   bilingual 

communication skills when requested by the Department. 

(b)  Officers who fail to utilize their bilingual skills when required may be deemed ineligible to 
receive  bilingual  pay.  In  these  circumstances  and  on  a  case  by  case  basis,  the  officer's

designee will make the final decision on eligibility. 

953.2.1   BILINGUAL TESTING PROCEDURES 

(a)  APD-HR   will   schedule   bilingual   tests   as   needed   with   a   professional   consultant   or 
organization  selected  by  the  Department.  A  test  will  be  given  for  each  requested 
compensable language. 

(b)  Any officer may take a bilingual test. Officers interested in testing for a language must submit 
an application for bilingual testing to their immediate supervisor to be forwarded through the 
chain-of-command to APD-HR. 

(c)  The bilingual test is a voluntary test. Officers must take the test on their own time, with no 

compensatory time or overtime pay allowed. 

(d)  APD-HR will notify officers taking a bilingual test of the test results by mail. Those officers 
who pass the bilingual test will begin earning bilingual pay during the pay period following 
the date the Department received notice of their successful completion of the test. Officers 
not passing the authorized proficiency test may retest after six (6) months. 

(e)     Officers passing the proficiency test may be required to be reassessed. 

953.3   MENTAL HEALTH CERTIFICATION PAY 
Eligible officers shall be compensated for mental health certification as identified in the Meet and

957.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The purpose of this policy is to provide reporting guidelines for employees who believe they have 
been exposed to any communicable disease during the normal course of their work. This policy 
covers the most prevalent types of reported exposures which are Tuberculosis (TB) and Blood 
Exposures (HIV, Hepatitis B & C). 

957.1.1   DEFINITION OF A COMMUNICABLE DISEASE EXPOSURE 
When  an  external  source  of  blood,  body  fluid  or  bacteria/virus  from  an  infected  person  comes 
into contact with an employees' mucous membranes (eyes, mouth, or nose), an opening in the 
officers' skin or is inhaled by the officer. 

957.2   PREVENTION OF EXPOSURE 
Each communicable disease has its own methods of causing infection. Each employee can limit 
the risk involved with any method by simply using the tools that are available to each of them. Use 
your (PPE's) personnel protection equipment i.e.: Rubber gloves, safety goggles and disposable 
filter masks to decrease the risk of exposure and becoming infected with any disease/illness. 

957.2.1   SUGGESTED EMPLOYEE ACTIONS IN ALL EXPOSURES 
Employees believing they have been involved in a blood exposure should: 

(a)  Thoroughly flush mucous membranes with water and thoroughly wash skin with soap and 

water or hand sanitizer. 

(b) 

It may be appropriate for the exposed employee who has been exposed to release care & 
custody  of the  suspect or  delegate other tasks to a fellow  employee  so that  the  exposed 
employee may take more immediate decontamination or sanitization measures. 

957.3   BLOOD EXPOSURES 
A blood exposure can occur when an external source of blood comes into contact with another 
person's mucous membranes (eyes, mouth, or nose) or an opening in the skin. The highest risk 
for contamination is with hepatitis. 

(a)  Notify  a  supervisor  and  proceed  immediately  to  any  hospital.  It  is  recommended,  but  not 
required, to use a hospital that is familiar with blood exposure protocol (e.g., Brackenridge, 
Seton Main, St. David's). 

(b)     Upon arriving at the hospital employees should: 

1. 

Explain to the intake nurse that they have been exposed to blood. 

2.  Review the circumstances of how the exposure occurred with the doctor. The ER 
doctor will make an initial determination on whether a blood exposure has occurred.

957.3.2   SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES 
Regardless of whether an ER doctor makes an initial determination that a blood exposure has 
occurred, supervisors will: 

(a)  Make  direct  phone  contact  with  the  on-duty  Watch  Lieutenant  via  (512)  974-7822.  If 
no  answer,  have  APD  Communications  facilitate  direct  phone  contact.  Brief  the  Watch 
Lieutenant on the circumstances of the exposure. 

(b)     Notify the Austin Travis County Health and Human Services Department (HHSD) at (512) 
972-5555  of any  potential  employee  blood exposure  incident.  Only  the HHSD  doctor  can 
make a final determination on whether a blood exposure has occurred. If it is after hours, 
supervisors  will  leave  a  short  message  with  the  employee's  name,  incident  number,  and 
whether the ER doctor made an initial determination of blood exposure. 

(c)  Fax   the   affidavit   and   addendum   to   HHSD   and   the   APD   physician   (see   957.1.4), 
then   fax   all   the   above   forms   and   discharge   paperwork   to   the   APD   Workers'

employee of the results. 

(b)  Employees  who  have  not  heard  from  the  Department  physician  within  72  hours  of  the 

incident should contact the physician directly. 

957.5   FILING OF CRIMINAL CHARGES 
If criminal charges are to be filed against an individual for attempting to expose an officer to blood, 
or  to  cause  alarm  or  harass  an  officer  by  putting  them  in  fear  of  being  infected,  regardless  if 
the  individual  is  carrying  a  communicable  disease,  the  officer  should  proceed  with  the  filing  of 
Harassment of a Public Servant (Tex. Penal Code § 22.11). 

(a)  The  individual  need  not  be  infected  with  a  communicable  disease  to  meet  the  elements 
of Harassment of a Public Servant and therefore no blood draw from the individual will be 
performed for the purpose of filing criminal charges.

(b)  Under  no  circumstances  will  any  suspect  or  person  be  requested  to  submit  to  any  blood 
and/or saliva sample for testing. Only the Travis County Health and Human Services has 
such authority. 

957.6   TUBERCULOSIS (TB) EXPOSURES 
Tuberculosis is a disease that is spread from person to person through the air. It must be inhaled 
by the victim for it to be contracted. Almost all TB can be cured. Becoming infected with TB is more 
difficult than previously believed. TB is almost always contracted while indoors with an infected 
person for long periods of time; the suns' UV (ultra violet) light kills active TB germs including drug 
resistant strains. 

(a)  The employee who suspects that they have been exposed to TB shall notify their supervisor 
and complete the workers' compensation packet (957.1.4) and the exposure affidavit packet 
(957.1.4). Follow the submittal instructions as provided in section 957.1.4 . There is no need 
to report to any Emergency room for possible TB exposures. 

(b)  The exposed employee shall contact the TB Surveillance team at the Travis County Health 
and Human Services Department (HHSD) during normal business hours. Their offices and 
clinic are located at 15 Waller street, Austin TX. This is the only location where testing for 
the COA is conducted. The Number is (512) 972-5460. 

(c)  The  exposed  employee  will  review  the  circumstances  with  the  team  and  may  arrange 
an  appointment  time  for  their  TB  testing.  Employees  are  reminded  to  contact  the  TB 
surveillance team by phone prior to any testing/treatment. Prior calling will help in arranging 
the most convenient and expedited testing for the employee. 

(d) 

(e) 

It   is  suggested   that   TB   testing  be  completed  by  the  HHSD  team  for  they  have  the 
most  advanced  experience  dealing  with  TB  and  utilize  the  more  advanced  blood  testing 
procedures.  The  blood  test  is  more  accurate,  less  subjective  and requires  only  one  visit, 
unlike the skin test which requires a subsequent interpretation visit. 

If  an  exposed  employee  desires  that  their  personal  physician  perform  the  test,  the 
employee  MUST  ensure  that  their  personal  physician  accepts  workers'  compensation 
claims. Otherwise, tests conducted will be at the employees' expense. 

957.7   EVIDENCE /PROPERTY HANDLING PROCEDURES 
Evidence or other materials coming into the custody of the Police Department and suspected of 
being contaminated should be treated with extraordinary care. 

(a)     General procedures: 

1. 

All materials contaminated with blood or other body fluids, whether wet or dry, will 
be handled with disposable rubber gloves. 

2.  Hypodermic needles and other sharp objects will be packaged in puncture resistant 

containers.

(a)  To prevent needle stick injuries; employees SHOULD NOT cap, bend, break, 
or  remove  needles  from  the  syringe,  or  otherwise  manipulate  the  needle 
by  hand.  The  needles  placement  in  the  protective  container  is  of  more 
importance. 

3. 

Blood or body fluid contaminated equipment 

(a)  Any Non-disposable item, when contaminated with blood/body fluid, will be 
treated as if the item has been exposed to a communicable disease. It should 
be cleaned with a disinfectant agent (i.e. Chlorine bleach-water solution of 
1:10; as recommended by the CDC- Center for Disease Control) followed by 
a thorough washing with soap and water. Metal items, such as handcuffs or 
service  weapons,  require  drying  and  lubrication/oil  treatment  afterwards  to 
prevent rust. 

(b)  Officer's Clothing contaminated with blood or body fluid should be removed 
evaluated by EMS or AFD and decontaminated at the scene or bagged as 
hazardous materials and disposed of per AFD Hazardous Materials policy or 
EMS Biohazard policy. 

4. 

Evidence with blood or body fluids should be packaged in accordance with methods 
outlined  in  evidence  handling  procedures  available  at  evidence  drop  off  locations. 
Items with blood or body fluid must be packaged to prevent any cross contamination 
of  other  evidence/property  and  must  be  clearly  marked  as  "Biohazard".  (Policy 
618.4.3 Submitting Biohazard material). 

957.8   QUARANTINE RESPONSE 
The  Center  for  Disease  Control  (CDC),  Department  of  State  Health  Services  (DSHS)  and 
the  Austin/Travis  County  Health  and  Human  Services  Department  (ATCHHS)  have  authority 
to  establish  quarantine  areas.  The  ATCHHS  is  the  local  health  authority.  The  Austin  Police 
Department will not establish a quarantine area. 

(a)     General Procedures: 

(a)  Quarantine orders will be obtained by the local health authority (HA). 

1. 

2. 

In exigent circumstances a verbal notification from the HA to law enforcement 
at the scene is acceptable as an official order. 

A written or verbal notice is similar to an arrest warrant. This is not an arrest, 
but a detention under an Order of Protective Custody as issued under HSC 
81.162. 

(b)  Persons who try to enter or leave quarantine may be guilty of a 3rd Degree Felony 

under HSC 81.085.

assignments  are  intended  to  provide  employees  with  the  ability  to  continue  working  within  the 
limits  of  their  restrictions  and  limitations  on  a  temporary  basis  while  providing  the  Department 
with productive employees during the interim period. The Department will engage in a good faith 
interactive process to consider reasonable accommodations for any employee with a temporary 
or permanent disability.

This section applies only to non-probationary, civil service employees. There is no constitutional 
or statutory entitlement to an Extended Limited Duty assignment. The Chief of Police has created 
this  policy  in  recognition  of  the  fact  that  in  many  instances,  an  injured  officer  may  still  make  a 
significant contribution to the Department's mission. 

(a)  The  intention  of  this  policy  is  to  place  injured  employees  in  temporary  positions  with  the 
understanding and expectation that they will return to Full Duty at some future date. 

1. 

Extended Limited Duty assignments are not intended to create a permanent Limited 
Duty career path. 

2.  While Extended Limited Duty assignments have no specified time limit, the Chief of 

Police retains the right to impose one at any time. 

(b)  Two (2) essential job functions of every Austin Police Officer are the ability to make a forcible 
arrest  and  qualify  with  a  firearm.  Extended  Limited  Duty  positions  waive  these  specific 
essential functions as long as the following requirements are met:

An employee's commander/manager or, in the event of an emergency, the Duty Commander, may 
place an employee on Restricted Duty status. When practical, these procedures will take place 
in private with only the employee, the employee's supervisor, and, if requested, IA present. Upon 
request,  IA  will  assist  supervisors  with  completing  the  proper  paperwork  to  place  an  employee 
on Restricted Duty.

Restricted Duty and listing all restrictions being placed upon the employee. 

Employees will acknowledge the order by signing their name. 

Employees  should  be  assigned  to  daytime  hours  to  maintain  accessibility  for  the 
investigator. 

Supervisors may request the employee's APD computer access be suspended. 

If required to do so, employees will turn in to their supervisor any Department issued 
equipment (e.g., badge, APD identification, building access cards, and Department 
issued firearms). 

(a)  Employees will receive a receipt for all property turned in. 

(b)  The property may be retained by the employee's supervisor or stored in Police 

Equipment. 

(b)     The Chief will be notified of the placement as soon as practical. 

(c)     The Restricted Duty status and related paperwork will become part of the IA investigative file. 

(d)     While  on  any  type  of  Restricted  Duty  status  or  suspension,  other  than  an  indefinite 
suspension,   employees   must   maintain   TCOLE   licensing   requirements   for   annual 
qualification and mandatory training. 

(a)  When employees are suspended or restricted from carrying their firearm on police 
facilities  and  the  TCOLE  annual  weapon's  qualification  requirement  might  be 
violated, they will notify their supervisor so approved arrangements might be made 
for weapons qualification.

Austin Police Department 
Policy Manual

 

APD Policy 2015-2 Issued 5-1-2015 

Employee Speech, Expression, and Social 
Networking 

972.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This policy is intended to address issues associated with employee use of social networking sites 
and to provide guidelines for the regulation and balancing of employee speech and expression 
with the legitimate needs of the Department. 

Nothing  in  this  policy  is  intended  to  prohibit  or  infringe  upon  any  employee's  communication, 
speech or expression that has been clearly established as protected or privileged. 

972.1.1   APPLICABILITY 
This  policy  applies  to  all  forms  of  communication  including  but  not  limited  to  film,  video,  print 
media, public or private speech, use of all Internet services, including the World Wide Web, email, 
file  transfer,  remote  computer  access,  news  services,  social  networking,  social  media,  instant 
messaging, blogs, forums, video and other file-sharing sites. 

972.2   POLICY 
Public employees occupy a trusted position in the community, and thus, their statements have the 
potential to contravene the policies and performance of this department. Due to the nature of the 
work and influence associated with the law enforcement profession, it is necessary that employees 
of this department be subject to certain reasonable limitations on their speech and expression. To 
achieve its mission and efficiently provide service to the public, the Austin Police Department will 
carefully balance the individual employee's rights against the Department's needs and interests 
when exercising a reasonable degree of control over its employees' speech and expression. 

972.3   SAFETY 
Employees  should  consider  carefully  the  implications  of  their  speech  or  any  other  form  of 
expression when using the Internet. Speech and expression that may negatively affect the safety 
of  the  Austin  Police  Department  employees,  such  as  posting  personal  information  in  a  public 
forum, can result in compromising an employee's home address or family ties. Employees should 
therefore not disseminate or post any information on any forum or medium that could reasonably 
be  expected  to  compromise  the  safety  or  privacy  of  any  employee,  an  employee's  family  or 
associates. 

972.4   PROHIBITED SPEECH, EXPRESSION AND CONDUCT 
To meet the Department's safety, performance, and public-trust needs, the following is prohibited: 

(a)  Speech or expression made pursuant to an official duty that tends to compromise or damage 
the mission, function, reputation or professionalism of the Austin Police Department or its 
employees.

Employee Speech, Expression, and Social Networking 

(b)  Speech  or  expression  that,  while  not  made  pursuant  to  an  official  duty,  is  significantly 
linked to, or related to, the Austin Police Department and tends to compromise or damage 
the mission, function, reputation or professionalism of the Austin Police Department or its 
employees. 

(c)  Speech or expression that could reasonably be foreseen as creating a negative impact on 
the credibility of the employee as a witness. For example, posting statements or expressions 
to a website that glorify or endorse dishonesty, unlawful discrimination or illegal behavior. 

(d)  Speech or expression of any form that could reasonably be foreseen as creating a negative 
impact on the safety of the employees of the Department. For example, a statement on a 
blog that provides specific details as to how and when prisoner transportations are made 
could reasonably be foreseen as potentially jeopardizing employees by informing criminals 
of details that could facilitate an escape or attempted escape. 

(e)  Speech or expression that is contrary to the canons of the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics 

as adopted by the Austin Police Department. 

(f)  Use or disclosure, through whatever means, of any information, photograph, video or other 
recording obtained or accessible as a result of employment with the Department for financial 
or personal gain, or any disclosure of such materials without the expressed authorization of 
the Chief of Police or designee (Tex. Penal Code § 39.06(a)(1)). 

(g)  Posting,   transmitting   or   disseminating   any   photographs,   video   or   audio   recordings, 
likenesses  or  images of department  logos,  emblems,  uniforms,  badges, patches,  marked 
vehicles, equipment or other material that specifically identifies the Austin Police Department 
on  any  personal  or  social  networking  or  other  website  or  web  page,  without  the  express 
written permission of the Chief of Police. 

(h)  Failure to take reasonable and prompt action to remove any content that is in violation of this 
policy and/or posted by others from any web page or website maintained by the employee 
(e.g., social or personal website). 

972.4.1   UNAUTHORIZED ENDORSEMENTS AND ADVERTISEMENTS 
Unless  specifically  authorized  by  the  Chief  of  Police,  employees  may  not  represent  the  Austin 
Police  Department  or  identify  themselves  in  any  way  as  being  affiliated  with  the  Austin  Police 
Department in order to do any of the following (Tex. Local Gov't Code § 556.004(c) and (d)): 

(a)  Endorse, support, oppose or contradict any political campaign or initiative. 

(b)  Endorse, support, oppose or contradict any social issue, cause or religion. 

(c)     Endorse, support or oppose any product, service, company or other commercial entity.

Employee Speech, Expression, and Social Networking 

Additionally,  when  it  can  reasonably  be  construed  that  an  employee,  acting  in  his  individual 
capacity or through some unofficial group or organization (e.g. bargaining group), is affiliated with 
this department the employee shall give a specific disclaiming statement that any such speech or 
expression is not representative of the Austin Police Department. 

Employees retain their right to vote as they choose, to support candidates of their choice and to 
express their opinions on political subjects and candidates at all times while off-duty. However, 
employees may not use their official authority or influence to interfere with or affect the result of an 
election or a nomination for office. Employees are also prohibited from directly or indirectly using 
their official authority to coerce, command or advise another employee to pay, lend or contribute 
anything of value to a party, committee, organization, agency or person for political purposes (5 
U.S.C. § 1502)). 

972.5   PRIVACY EXPECTATION 
Employees  forfeit  any  expectation  of  privacy  with  regard  to  anything  published  or  maintained 
through file-sharing software or any Internet site open to public view (e.g., Facebook, MySpace). 

Additional guidelines on privacy expectations are outlined in: 

(a)  Policy 1000 (Department Technology Use); and 

(b)     Policy 1002 (Electronic Mail (Email) Communications).

As  part  of  the  APD  readiness  program  all  employees  will  complete  Securing  the  Humans 
Cyber-Security Awareness Training for Police. This will ensure that during an unplanned event, 
employees will be able to access a city computer from home or other remote location if directed by 
a supervisor. It will also ensure that that employees and supervisors are aware of the requirements 
for tele-working (i.e., reporting for time and attendance, overtime usage, computer security etc.)

another personal computer are considered to be "tele-working": 

1.  CTM requires that virus and firewall protection be installed an employee's personal 
computer.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  employee  to  keep  this  software  up  to  date 
on  security  patches  (The  City  provides  free  downloads  of  Antivirus  and  Firewall 
software) 

2. 

3. 

4. 

5. 

Employees will comply with the City of Austin Tele-work Personnel Procedures and 
agrees to the duties, obligations, responsibilities and conditions for remote access 
described in that document. 

Tele-work access must be scheduled in advance and approved by the employee's 
immediate supervisor (lieutenants are exempt from this requirement.) 

If technical difficulties occur employees must report those issues to the Help Desk 
(974 HELP) 

If employees cannot access the COA network, and do not have sufficient work tasks 
to accomplish without this access, they may be required to come into the office to 
complete the workday. 

6. 

Employees will code their time sheet with TLC for hours worked while tele-working.

email system or message of another employee merely to satisfy curiosity about the affairs 
of others.

confidential communications. If a communication must be confidential, an alternative method

interest to all users and, as such, are restricted to Command Personnel or designee.

authorization. Email users that have a need to delegate this function will use email program 
settings to give access to authorized employees.

This policy outlines the Department procedures for handling employee deaths, funerals, and the 
Department Funeral Committee. 

1007.1.1   EMPLOYEE DEATHS 

(a)  Upon the death of an employee it will be the responsibility of the employee's Commander/ 

Manager to notify the chairperson of the Funeral Committee. 

(b)  After receiving notification, the Funeral Committee chairperson will: 

1. 

If practical, have a member of the Funeral Committee accompany the person going 
to notify the survivors. 

2.  Contact the Special Events Lieutenant to coordinate the Motorcycle Unit for escort 

purposes. 

1007.1.2   BADGE MOURNING BAND 
Guidelines for the wearing of a badge mourning band are outlined in Policy 801 (Equipment and 
Uniform Regulations). 

1007.2   FUNERAL COMMITTEE 

(a)  The  Department  has  established  a  funeral  committee  composed  of  a  chairperson  and 
eleven other members (commissioned and non-sworn) from within the Department. The total 
membership may vary from time to time, but efforts will be made to have a representative 
cross-section of the Department serving on the committee. Two seats on the committee are 
reserved exclusively for retired sworn members of the Department. 

(b)  When  requested  by  the  survivors  of  a  deceased  employee,  a  committee  member  will  be 
appointed  as  Survivors'  Assistance  Officer  (SAO)  to  assist  members  of  the  family.  They 
shall also help as needed until any responsibility of the Department to the surviving family 
members has been met. This liaison shall coordinate with and work through the committee 
chairperson. The SAO will be the primary liaison between the survivors and the concerned 
City, state and/or federal agencies. 

(c) 

In  certain  instances,  when  the  decedent's  family  requests  assistance  in  making  funeral 
arrangements from an employee who is not a Funeral Committee member, that employee 
will  work  in  conjunction  with  the  Funeral  Committee's  SAO.  When  under  these  stressful 
conditions  employees  are  reminded  to  be  cautious  of  making  statements  which  might 
obligate  the  Department,  its  resources,  or  its  personnel  to  family  members.  Funeral 
Committee members are authorized by the Department to make these decisions and should

Building Security 

1009.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
The size and complexity of APD facilities and the need for visitor access to numerous departmental 
areas  mandate  the  establishment  of  a  visible  visitor  and  employee  recognition  system  for 
the  security  and  protection  of  persons  and  property.  Employees  share  the  responsibility  for 
maintaining standards and attitudes which are conducive to this end. A prerequisite to the success 
of  Department facility  security  is  the  total  cooperation  and commitment  of  employees  and their 
determination to enforce the required control measures. 

1009.2   GENERAL SECURITY GUIDELINES 
Security  of  APD  facilities  is  each  employee's  responsibility.  Access  cards  and  keys  provide 
controlled entry to Department facilities and to certain areas within them. 

(a)  For the purpose of security, areas within Department facilities will be designated as one of 

the following: 

1.  Restricted  Access  Area  -  An  area  where  only  authorized  personnel  or  persons 

under escort are granted access due to the sensitive nature of the work. 

2.  Controlled Access Area - An area where the public is allowed to be after receiving 

authorization from facility security personnel. 

3. 

Public Access Area - An area where the public is authorized to be. 

(b)  Employees  will  be  issued  identification  cards  (APD  ID),  access  cards,  and  keys  to  open 

doorways into areas for which they have been authorized access. 

1. 

APD ID's are white in color. 

2.  Officers will have an image of the APD badge adjacent to the officer's photo and their 

rank preceding the officer's name. 

3.  Civilian employees will have their photo and will state 'EMPLOYEE' on the front of 

the ID. 

4.  Retired employees will state 'RETIRED' in red uppercase text. 

5. 

Temporary, contract, and interns for the Department will display a diagonal red field 
behind their photo and the APD ID will contain an expiration date. 

(c)  Visitors having legitimate business at a Department facility will check in with the front desk 

of the facility and be required to: 

State  the  nature  of  their  business  or  the  name  of  the  APD  employee  or  unit  with 
whom they have business.

Purchasing 

1011.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE 
This  document  outlines  basic  information  concerning  policies  and  procedures  to  be  followed 
in  procuring  goods  and  services  for  Department  use.  It  also  contains  general  instructions 
and  descriptions  of  the  solicitation  process  and  is  intended  to  provide  procedures  to  help 
employees  make  purchases.  The  Financial  Services  Division  (FSD)  should  be  contacted  for 
specific information. 

1011.2   PURCHASING GUIDELINES 
The  authority  to  enter  into  a  purchase  agreement  or  contract  for  the  City  rests  with  the 
City  Manager  and  designee(s).  The  City  Central  Purchasing  Office  has  authorized  selected 
departmental personnel to make limited departmental purchases. A properly completed Purchase 
Order is a legally binding contract and should be treated accordingly. 

(a)  No individual may obligate the City of Austin to procurement indebtedness, for any goods 
or services, without prior approval from either APD Procurement & Contract Services or the 
City Central Purchasing Office. 

(b)  Purchase Orders are created in APD Procurement & Contract Services or the City Central 
Purchasing Office following submission of a Purchase Requisition Form (PRF) by the end 
user or requestor. 

(c)  Unauthorized personnel who attempt to contract in the name of the City may be subject to 

disciplinary and legal action, and civil liability. 

1011.2.1   PURCHASING PROCESS 
The  single  biggest  concern  expressed  about  the  purchasing  process  is  Processing  Time.  The 
single  best  way  to  minimize  processing  time  is  to  contact  a  buyer  at  the  earliest  point  in  the 
project  that  there  may  be  reason  to  believe  that  approval  will  be  given  for  the  purchase.  The 
earlier  in  the  process  that  APD  Procurement  &  Contract  Services  is  involved,  the  easier  it  is 
to  cope  with  constraints  within  our  system  and/or  the  manufacturer's  or  vendor's  supply  chain. 
APD Procurement & Contract Services must be involved in every phase of the project; planning, 
pre-bid, vendor correspondence, kick off meetings, etc. Our common purpose in the purchasing 
process should be to maximize our options with vendors in a cooperative effort between the user/ 
requisitioner and the buyer. 

(a)  All APD purchases require an authorized Purchase Request Form (PRF) be completed and 
submitted to APD Procurement & Contract Services prior to making a purchase; no purchase 
will be made without a completed PRF. 

1. 

The  end  user  is  responsible  for  providing  and  developing  all  aspects  of  the 
specifications or scope of work and ensuring they are correct and appropriate prior 
to solicitation.

service capable of meeting the Department's requirement, and that item or service is only 
available from the source recommended, based on: 

1.  Compatibility  of  equipment,  accessories,  or  replacement  parts  is  an  overriding 

consideration and the goods can only be supplies by one source; or

A single source situation exists if one or more of the following situations prevail: 

(a)  Warranty will be voided if service is provided by other contract vendor. 

(b)  Replacement parts to an existing City owned item.

particular vendor must be utilized.

the requestor must: 

(a)  Prepare a memorandum documenting the reasons that the item or service requested
