Use of Force

300.1   PURPOSE AND SCOPE
This policy provides guidelines on the reasonable use of force. While there is no way to specify
the exact amount or type of reasonable force to be applied in any situation, every member of this
department is expected to use these guidelines to make such decisions in a professional, impartial
and reasonable manner.

300.1.1   DEFINITIONS
Definitions related to this policy include:

Deadly force - Force reasonably anticipated and intended to create a substantial likelihood of
causing death or very serious injury.

Force - The application of physical techniques or tactics, chemical agents or weapons to another
person.  It  is  not  a  use  of  force  when  a  person  allows  him/herself  to  be  searched,  escorted,
handcuffed or restrained.

300.2   POLICY
The use of force by law enforcement personnel is a matter of critical concern, both to the public
and to the law enforcement community. Officers are involved on a daily basis in numerous and
varied interactions and, when warranted, may use reasonable force in carrying out their duties.

Officers must have an understanding of, and true appreciation for, their authority and limitations.
This is especially true with respect to overcoming resistance while engaged in the performance
of law enforcement duties.

The Department recognizes and respects the value of all human life and dignity without prejudice
to anyone. Vesting officers with the authority to use reasonable force and to protect the public
welfare requires monitoring, evaluation and a careful balancing of all interests.

300.2.1   DUTY TO INTERCEDE
Any officer present and observing another officer using force that is clearly beyond that which is
reasonable under the circumstances shall, when in a position to do so, intercede to prevent the
use of such excessive force. An officer who observes another employee use force that exceeds
the degree of force permitted by law should promptly report these observations to a supervisor.

300.3   USE OF FORCE
Officers shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears necessary given the facts
and circumstances perceived by the officer at the time of the event to accomplish a legitimate law
enforcement purpose.

The reasonableness of force will be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the
scene at the time of the incident. Any evaluation of reasonableness must allow for the fact that
officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force that reasonably

Use of Force

appears necessary in a particular situation, with limited information and in circumstances that are
tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving.

Given that no policy can realistically predict every possible situation an officer might encounter,
officers are entrusted to use well-reasoned discretion in determining the appropriate use of force
in each incident.

It  is  also  recognized  that  circumstances  may  arise  in  which  officers  reasonably  believe  that  it
would be impractical or ineffective to use any of the tools, weapons or methods provided by the
Department. Officers may find it more effective or reasonable to improvise their response to rapidly
unfolding conditions that they are confronting. In such circumstances, the use of any improvised
device or method must nonetheless be reasonable and utilized only to the degree that reasonably
appears necessary to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose.

While the ultimate objective of every law enforcement encounter is to avoid or minimize injury,
nothing in this policy requires an officer to retreat or be exposed to possible physical injury before
applying reasonable force.

300.3.1   USE OF FORCE TO EFFECT AN ARREST
Any peace officer may use reasonable force to effect an arrest, to prevent escape or to overcome
resistance. A peace officer who makes or attempts to make an arrest need not retreat or desist
from his/her efforts by reason of resistance or threatened resistance on the part of the person
being arrested; nor shall an officer be deemed the aggressor or lose his/her right to self-defense
by  the  use  of  reasonable  force  to  effect  the  arrest,  prevent  escape  or  to  overcome  resistance
(Penal Code § 835).

300.3.2   FACTORS USED TO DETERMINE THE REASONABLENESS OF FORCE
When determining whether to apply force and evaluating whether an officer has used reasonable
force, a number of factors should be taken into consideration, as time and circumstances permit.
These factors include, but are not limited to:

Immediacy and severity of the threat to officers or others.

The conduct of the individual being confronted, as reasonably perceived by the officer at
the time.

(c) Officer/subject  factors  (age,  size,  relative  strength,  skill  level,  injuries  sustained,  level  of

exhaustion or fatigue, the number of officers available vs. subjects).

The effects of drugs or alcohol.

Subject's mental state or capacity.

Proximity of weapons or dangerous improvised devices.

The degree to which the subject has been effectively restrained and his/her ability to resist
despite being restrained.

(h)

The availability of other options and their possible effectiveness.

300.3.3   PRESSURE POINT COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES
Pressure  point  compliance  techniques  may  be  effective  in  controlling  a  physically  or  actively
resisting individual. Officers may only apply those pressure point compliance techniques for which
they have successfully completed department-approved training. Officers utilizing any pressure
point compliance technique should consider:

(a)

The degree to which the application of the technique may be controlled given the level of
resistance.

(b) Whether the person can comply with the direction or orders of the officer.

(c) Whether the person has been given sufficient opportunity to comply.

The application of any pressure point compliance technique shall be discontinued once the officer
determines that compliance has been achieved.

300.3.4   CAROTID CONTROL HOLD
The  proper  application  of  the  carotid  control  hold  may  be  effective  in  restraining  a  violent  or
combative individual. However, due to the potential for injury, the use of the carotid control hold
is subject to the following:

The officer shall have successfully completed department-approved training in the use and
application of the carotid control hold.

The carotid control hold may only be used when circumstances perceived by the officer at
the time indicate that such application reasonably appears necessary to control a person in
any of the following circumstances:

The subject is violent or physically resisting.

1.

2.

The subject, by words or actions, has demonstrated an intention to be violent and
reasonably appears to have the potential to harm officers, him/herself or others.

The  application  of  a  carotid  control  hold  on  the  following  individuals  should  generally
be avoided unless the totality of the circumstances indicates that other available options
reasonably appear ineffective, or would present a greater danger to the officer, the subject or
others, and the officer reasonably believes that the need to control the individual outweighs
the risk of applying a carotid control hold:

Females who are known to be pregnant

1.

2.

3.

Elderly individuals

Obvious juveniles

Any  individual  who  has  had  the  carotid  control  hold  applied,  regardless  of  whether  he/
she  was  rendered  unconscious,  shall  be  promptly  examined  by  paramedics  or  other
qualified medical personnel and should be monitored until examined by paramedics or other
appropriate medical personnel.

The officer shall inform any person receiving custody, or any person placed in a position of
providing care, that the individual has been subjected to the carotid control hold and whether
the subject lost consciousness as a result.

Any officer attempting or applying the carotid control hold shall promptly notify a supervisor
of the use or attempted use of such hold.

The use or attempted use of the carotid control hold shall be thoroughly documented by the
officer in any related reports.

300.4   DEADLY FORCE APPLICATIONS
Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:

An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably
believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.

An  officer  may  use  deadly  force  to  stop  a  fleeing  subject  when  the  officer  has  probable
cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the
infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably
believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person
if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning
should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.

Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even
if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an
imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:

1.

2.

The  person  has  a  weapon  or  is  attempting  to  access  one  and  it  is  reasonable  to
believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.

The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon
and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.

300.4.1   SHOOTING AT OR FROM MOVING VEHICLES
Shots fired at or from a moving vehicle are rarely effective. Officers should move out of the path of
an approaching vehicle instead of discharging their firearm at the vehicle or any of its occupants.
An officer should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants when the officer
reasonably  believes  there  are  no  other  reasonable  means  available  to  avert  the  threat  of  the
vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others.

Officers should not shoot at any part of a vehicle in an attempt to disable the vehicle.

300.5   REPORTING THE USE OF FORCE
Any use of force by a member of this department shall be documented promptly, completely and
accurately in an appropriate report, depending on the nature of the incident. The officer should
articulate the factors perceived and why he/she believed the use of force was reasonable under the
circumstances. To collect data for purposes of training, resource allocation, analysis and related
purposes, the Department may require the completion of additional report forms, as specified in
department policy, procedure or law.

300.5.1   NOTIFICATION TO SUPERVISORS
Supervisory notification shall be made as soon as practicable following the application of force in
any of the following circumstances:

The application caused a visible injury.

The application would lead a reasonable officer to conclude that the individual may have
experienced more than momentary discomfort.

The individual subjected to the force complained of injury or continuing pain.

The individual indicates intent to pursue litigation.

Any application of a TASER device or control device.

Any application of a restraint device other than handcuffs, shackles or belly chains.

The individual subjected to the force was rendered unconscious.

An individual was struck or kicked.

An individual alleges any of the above has occurred.

300.6   MEDICAL CONSIDERATION
Prior to booking or release, medical assistance shall be obtained for any person who exhibits signs
of physical distress, who has sustained visible injury, expresses a complaint of injury or continuing
pain, or who was rendered unconscious. Any individual exhibiting signs of physical distress after
an encounter should be continuously monitored until he/she can be medically assessed.

Based  upon  the  officer's  initial  assessment  of  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  subject's  injuries,
medical assistance may consist of examination by fire personnel, paramedics, hospital staff or
medical staff at the jail. If any such individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal shall be

fully documented in related reports and, whenever practicable, should be witnessed by another
officer and/or medical personnel. If a recording is made of the contact or an interview with the
individual, any refusal should be included in the recording, if possible.

The on-scene supervisor, or if not available, the primary handling officer shall ensure that any
person  providing  medical  care  or  receiving  custody  of  a  person  following  any  use  of  force  is
informed that the person was subjected to force. This notification shall include a description of the
force used and any other circumstances the officer reasonably believes would be potential safety
or medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, impaired respiration).

Persons  who  exhibit  extreme  agitation,  violent  irrational  behavior  accompanied  by  profuse
sweating, extraordinary strength beyond their physical characteristics and imperviousness to pain
(sometimes called "excited delirium"), or who require a protracted physical encounter with multiple
officers to be brought under control, may be at an increased risk of sudden death. Calls involving
these persons should be considered medical emergencies. Officers who reasonably suspect a
medical emergency should request medical assistance as soon as practicable and have medical
personnel stage away if appropriate.

300.7   SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY
When a supervisor is able to respond to an incident in which there has been a reported application
of force, the supervisor is expected to:

(a) Obtain  the  basic  facts  from  the  involved  officers.  Absent  an  allegation  of  misconduct  or

excessive force, this will be considered a routine contact in the normal course of duties.

(b) Complete an entry into the Force Analysis System when any of the following thresholds exist:

1.

2.

4.

5.

projectiles, etc.)

6.

Unusual circumstances

(c) Complete  an  internal  administrative  interview  of  the  subject  upon  whom  the  force  was

applied when the following thresholds exist:

The  suspect  requires  medical  attention  at  a  hospital  as  a  result  of  a  use  of  force
incident and their injuries are moderate or greater (Examples: sutures, broken bones,
etc.). Does not include Taser dart removal unless injuries justify the need.

The suspect alleged excessive force.

The suspect was bit by a K-9. (Interview and FAS input will be conducted by K-9 Sgt.)

4.

Unusual circumstances.

(d)

Ensure that any injured parties are examined and treated.

(e) When possible, separately obtain a recorded interview with the subject upon whom force
was applied. If this interview is conducted without the person having voluntarily waived his/
her Miranda rights, the following shall apply:

1.

2.

3.

The content of the interview should not be summarized or included in any related
criminal charges.

The  fact  that  a  recorded  interview  was  conducted  should  be  documented  in  a
property or other report.

The  recording  of  the  interview  should  be  distinctly  marked  for  retention  until  all
potential for civil litigation has expired.

(f)

Once any initial medical assessment has been completed or first aid has been rendered,
ensure that photographs have been taken of any areas involving visible injury or complaint
of pain, as well as overall photographs of uninjured areas. These photographs should be
retained until all potential for civil litigation has expired.

(g)

Identify any witnesses not already included in related reports.

(h) Review and approve all related reports.

(i)

Determine if there is any indication that the subject may pursue civil litigation.

1.

If there is an indication of potential civil litigation, the supervisor should complete and
route a notification of a potential claim through the appropriate channels.

(j)

Evaluate  the  circumstances  surrounding  the  incident  and  initiate  an  administrative
investigation  if  there  is  a  question  of  policy  non-compliance  or  if  for  any  reason  further
investigation may be appropriate.

Should the supervisor determine that any application of force was not within policy, a separate
internal  affairs  investigation  shall  be  initiated.  In  the  event  the  supervisor  believes  the  incident
may give rise to potential civil litigation, an Unusual Occurrence Report should be completed and
routed to appropriate personnel.

In the event that a supervisor is unable to respond to the scene of an incident involving the reported
application of force, the supervisor is still expected to complete as many of the above items as
circumstances permit.

All internal administrative interviews should be recorded and downloaded into DIMS. All recordings
will be stored for a minimum of three (3) years.

300.7.1   WATCH COMMANDER RESPONSIBILITY
The Watch Commander shall review each use of force by any personnel within his/her command
to ensure compliance with this policy and to address any training issues.
