Passive Resistance: A subject’s failure to comply with an officer’s lawful 
commands.  An example of passive resistance would be a subject lying or sitting 
down when directed to remain standing, or a subject becoming limp (dead weight) 
when an officer is attempting to transport them by foot. 

Active Resistance: A subject's physical actions which prevent an officer's lawful 
actions in attempting to place a subject into custody, attempting to stop a subject 
from escaping custody and/or an officer’s otherwise lawful attempts to take 
control of the subject.  An example of this would be fleeing on foot.

Aggressive Resistance:  A threat or overt act of an assault (through physical or 
verbal means), coupled with the apparent present ability to carry out the threat or 
assault, which  reasonably indicates that an assault or injury to any person is 
imminent.  An example of aggressive resistance would be a subject physically 
forcing their hands underneath their body and physically resisting an officer's 
attempt to gain control of the subject or violently pulling away from an officer 
who is attempting to control them. 

Deadly Force:  Force which is reasonably likely to result in death or serious 
injury. 

E. 

Lethal Weapon:  A firearm which, when discharged, is likely to cause death. 

Less Lethal Weapon:  A weapon which, when used according to Departmental  
training guidelines, is not likely to cause death. 

Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Pepper Spray: A non-lethal cayenne pepper-based  
agent that causes instant inflammation of mucous membranes, closure of the eyes, 
inflammation of the trachea and a burning sensation of the skin.   

Physical Force: The use of any method, technique, or Less Lethal weapon which 
involves physical contact for the purpose of restricting or controlling the 
movement or behavior of a person. 
 
Reasonable Belief: Facts and/or circumstances, including the reasonable 
inferences drawn therefrom, known to an officer at the time he or she uses force 
that would cause a reasonable officer to believe that the use of force is necessary 
and appropriate. 

Serious Physical Injury:  Bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death or 
that causes serious permanent disfigurement, coma, a permanent or protracted  
condition that causes extreme pain, or permanent or protracted loss or impairment 
of the function of any bodily member or organ, or that results in prolonged  
hospitalization.   

Drive Stun:  Activating the Conducted Electrical Weapon while holding the  
front of the device against the target without firing the projectiles.  The drive stun  
causes significant localized pain, but does not have an incapacitating effect on the  
central nervous system.  

L.        Conducted Electrical Weapon (CEW):  A less lethal electronic neuromuscular  
incapacitation weapon that transmits an electrical signal resulting in an immediate 
 
loss of a person’s neuromuscular control and the ability to perform coordinated  
 
action for the duration of the impulse.

Q. 

A. 

 
 

Conducted Electrical Weapon Certified Officer:  An officer who has  
successfully completed all required training in the use and deployment of the  
CEW. 

 

Conducted Electrical Weapon Cycle:  Duration of a CEW discharge following  
a single CEW activation. 

Standard Conducted Electrical Weapon Cycle:  A five second electrical cycle  
occurring when a CEW trigger is pressed and released.  The standard cycle may  
be shortened by turning the CEW off. 

Spit Sock: An individually packaged, disposable lightweight hood used to  
prohibit an arrestee from expectorating and deter biting.  The Spit Sock allows  
arrestees to breath without interference and permits visual observation of the  
arrestee’s face. 

Maximum Restraint Position: Placing a subject with their hands secured 
behind their back, legs secured together, and their legs and hands connected 
together behind the subject's back with the subject’s legs flexed at the knees.  
Subject is laying on their side or face-down.  **THIS POSITION IS 
STRICTLY PROHIBITED.** 

SAGE Control Ordnance SL6 Less Lethal Launcher:  A six (6) shot projectile  
firing weapon which fires less lethal impact munitions, that when used according  
to Departmental training guidelines is not likely to cause death. 

The WSPD use of force continuum (Attachment A) is a model to guide officers in 
use of force decisions.  Officers should understand the Use of Force options 
available to them and recognize that any Use of Force option has the potential to 
cause an injury to a subject depending on the variables surrounding the totality of 
circumstances of an incident.  Officers should consider possible effects and 
injuries caused by the use of force beyond the direct intended effect of that 
particular use of force, for example if a CEW was used on a person standing on 
the side of a bridge, it should be expected that the person may fall off the side of 
the bridge and become injured as a result of the fall.   

When deadly force is justified, officers may utilize any issued weapon in response 
as they see appropriate based on the threat presented by the suspect, their 
assessment of the threat and their determination of the most appropriate response.

Unless otherwise approved by a Bureau Commander, it is mandatory that 
uniformed officers, both on and off-duty must carry all issued equipment to 
include the handcuffs, CEW,  baton, OC, firearm, magazines, radio, and flashlight 
when working patrol/security/traffic enforcement duties.

Psychological force established through the officer’s arrival on the scene  
and symbols of authority (badge, uniform, etc.). 

2. 

Verbal Direction/Control 

Conversation, advice, commands or instructions utilized by the officer to  
control or de-escalate a confrontation.  Verbal communication, when  
applicable, should accompany officer actions, including the officer’s  
identification and announcement of arrest, if appropriate, as outlined in  
NCGS § 15A-401(c) (2).  Officers should utilize good verbalization  
during all levels of force.

OC Pepper Spray: Use is preferred over attempts to control a  
subject by escalating physical force.  Should basic wrist  
control/restraints (soft hand techniques) prove ineffective, the use  
of OC should be evaluated. 

 

 

Hard Hand Control: Techniques which have a higher probability  
of injury, such as punches or kicks. 

Conducted Electrical Weapon:  The use of the CEW is allowed  
in an attempt to control an assaultive subject and/or to prevent an  
imminent threat of an assault such as aggressive resistance.  Verbal 
statements alone do not constitute aggressive resistance behavior.   
Should the use of other options such as the use of OC Pepper  
Spray or Hard Hand Control Techniques prove ineffective or not  
be viable, the use of a CEW should be evaluated.

III.  DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING OF USE OF FORCE INCIDENTS    
 
 
 
 
 

Employees shall notify their immediate supervisor, as soon as possible, after an incident  
involving the use of the SAGE Launcher, OC, tear gas, baton, use or threatened use of a  
CEW, or firearm on a citizen.    If the incident occurs while the employee is off-duty, he  
will immediately notify the on-duty Field Commander.   

Deadly Force: Actions which would likely result in serious injury or  
death, including the use of firearms, baton strikes to the head, choke holds  
or any technique used to stop the use or imminent use of deadly force. 

 

A. 

Employees shall document in an Incident Report and Less Lethal   Weapons 
Supplement Report (Attachment B) any incident involving the use of the SAGE 
Launcher, OC, tear gas, baton, or use or threatened use of a CEW on a citizen.  
Any other use of force incident will be documented in an Incident Report only. A 
report will not be required when the force used was limited to soft hand contact 
such as touching and the routine application of handcuffs.   If an officer is 
uncertain whether the restraint or control used is a reportable use, he shall notify 
his immediate  supervisor who will make the determination.  

 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

B. 

Any incident involving the use of the SAGE Launcher, OC, tear gas, baton, use or 
threatened use of a CEW, or firearm on a citizen will be considered a use of force 
incident and reviewed accordingly.   

 
C.  Weapons will be utilized only by employees who have successfully completed all  
 
 
D. 

required training in the use and deployment of the weapon.  
 
Use of force incidents on a citizen will be reported in an internal investigation 
package in accordance with the Internal Investigations Manual.  The package will 
consist of an Incident  Report, Supplements, Less Lethal Weapons Supplement 
Report, any available video and/or audio recordings and an 
Administrative/Incident Investigation Review form.  If the subject  is transported 
to a hospital due to the exposure or other in-custody injuries, the package will 
include a Pre-Confinement form.  
 
If a citizen is injured or requires transport to a hospital under the guidelines of this 
General Order, the citizen will be taken to Forsyth Medical Center, or if  
specifically requested, to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, unless in the  
officer’s opinion EMS is more appropriate for the situation.  Subjects who are not  
under arrest cannot be forced to respond to the hospital.

F. 

Should the condition of a subject deteriorate while being transported by an officer 
to the hospital, the officer shall use his best judgment based on time of day, 
proximity to the hospital, estimated arrival time of EMS, traffic volume, etc., 
when determining whether or not to proceed on to the hospital, render aid, or 
contact and wait for EMS.  

Complaints of unauthorized use of force will be investigated by the Professional  
Standards Division (PSD) in accordance with the Management of Professional  
Standards of Conduct.

B. 

The use of OC is preferred over attempts to control a subject by escalating   
physical restraint.  Should basic wrist control/restraints (soft hand techniques)  
prove ineffective, the use of OC should be evaluated. 

Any person known by the employee to be affected by OC shall be offered 
assistance without delay pursuant to General Order 1.11, Injuries to Persons and 
Arrestees: Fatal and Non-Fatal/Illnesses of Arrestees.  Employees will ask the 
exposed subject if he has any current respiratory conditions or a history of 
respiratory conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, etc. and conduct a 
visual inspection of the subject for a medic-alert bracelet or necklace indicating 
the existence of a condition immediately after exposure.  The exposed subject 
shall be constantly watched for signs of distress to include, but not limited to, 
difficulty breathing, heavy sweating, or signs of excited delirium until the point 
the subject is no longer under the employee’s control.

If the subject is not in custody and appears to be in a normal state of 
health, but indicates that he has a current respiratory condition or a history 
of respiratory conditions, the subject will be  offered transportation by the 
officer to a hospital.  The officer may also contact EMS if the subject 
prefers not to ride with the officer.  A subject who has not been arrested 
may not be forced to receive decontamination or medical treatment. 

If a subject who is in custody indicates that he has a current respiratory  
conditions or a history of respiratory problems, the officer will  
transport the arrested subject to a hospital unless in the officer’s  
opinion EMS is more appropriate for transport.

prove ineffective or not be viable, the use of a CEW should be evaluated. 
 
1. 
 

The CEW will be utilized only by officers who have successfully    
completed all required training in the use and deployment of the device.  

Use will be consistent with training as defined by the CEW lesson plan  
and hands-on training. 

Officers will target the lower portion of center mass or the legs of a  
subject’s body when deploying a CEW.  Officer should avoid, if possible,  
aiming probes at a subject’s head, neck and genital areas. 

B.        Officers will NOT use a CEW in the following circumstances:  

On a subject who is near, or has been exposed to, potentially  
flammable, volatile or explosive materials. 

 

When a subject is in a significant amount of water. 

When a subject is in a position where a fall may cause substantial  
injury or death. 

Punitively; as a means of coercion or in any other unjustified manner. 

Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the authority of an officer to use  
deadly force as permitted by law. 
 
SPECIAL consideration, consistent with Departmental training, should be  
given for the use of and prior to the use of the CEW on a subject who meets  
the criteria listed below. 
 
Use of the CEW will only be justified on these subjects when the subject's    
behavior is at the assaultive level; and/or so violent that it could result in serious  
physical injury to themselves or others and lower levels of force are unsafe or  
ineffective; or it is reasonable to believe lower levels of force would be unsafe or  
ineffective given the circumstances surrounding the incident.   

Is visibly pregnant. 

Is fleeing on foot-Officers will NOT use a CEW in an attempt to stop a  
fleeing subject purely for the person’s fleeing/flight alone without an  
accompanying justifiable reason.  For example, a subject who flees at the  
sight of a police officer may not be subjected to the CEW. 

Is operating a functioning, operable motor vehicle.

5. 

Is handcuffed. 

Officers must thoroughly document their justification for the use of a CEW on  
subjects who are identified as requiring special consideration.   

D.  When deploying a CEW, officers should use one (1) standard CEW cycle (five 
seconds) and re-evaluate.  If subsequent activations are necessary, they should 
normally be limited to two (2) reactivations (not to exceed 5 seconds each) as 
necessary to gain control of the subject.  Officers must be able to articulate the 
circumstances that warranted any additional CEW activations beyond the initial 
three (3) activations.  An example would be no available or immediate back up 
with continued aggressive resistance by the suspect. 

The CEW shall not be used in drive-stun mode without a cartridge attached as a 
pain compliance technique. 

CEWs may be used in drive-stun mode only to supplement the probe mode to 
complete the incapacitation circuit.  The drive stun function without the 
cartridge attached shall be used only in exigent circumstances such as a 
cartridge malfunction and/or during a cartridge change where other use of 
force options are not practical or readily available. 

Officers shall handle and store the CEW in the same manner as a firearm,   
exercising a due regard for safety. 

The CEW will be carried on the officer's support side to be drawn from the CEW  
holster in a cross-draw manner with the officer's dominant hand.   

After receiving appropriate training from a Certified CEW Instructor and approval 
from their assigned Division Commander, officers assigned to specialized units  
(i.e. S.W.A.T. , Special Investigation Division), may utilize alternative  
carrying/holstering methods.  

 

Conducted Electrical Weapon Evidence Collection 

In the event of a serious injury and/or death involving a CEW, evidence collection 
must be conducted so as to ensure the integrity of evidence.  The following  
guidelines should be followed (Refer to General Order 4.11, Evidence and  
Property Management): 

1. 
 

Photograph wounds, probe impacts, and/or drive-stun  
marks (with scale for reference in the photo).

Photograph the subject to document where injuries are present and   
where injuries are not present. 

Keep the original battery in the CEW (certain CEW models require the  
battery to always remain inserted to keep the integrity of the CEW’s  
internal clock). 

Retain and properly store the cartridge probes and wires.  Place the probes 
in a paper bag. Do not wind the wire up –maintain wire integrity as best as 
possible. 

Collect and maintain, as evidence, the subject’s clothing in the event that a 
probe penetrated or was attached to the clothing or for later analysis of  
potential probe impact sites. 

Collect several AFID tags, if at all possible, from the TASER cartridge(s)  
and note their locations at the scene.   

Any person appearing to have been adversely affected following exposure 
to a CEW will be offered assistance without delay pursuant to General 
Order 1.11, Injuries to Persons and Arrestees: Fatal and Non-Fatal 
Illnesses of Arrestees.  In all cases of CEW deployment against a person, 
officers will ask the exposed subject if he has a history of cardiac-related 
health issues and conduct a visual inspection of the subject for a medic-
alert bracelet or necklace indicating the existence of a medical condition 
immediately after exposure.  All exposed subjects shall be constantly 
watched for signs of distress to include, but not limited to, difficulty 
breathing, heavy sweating, or signs of excited delirium until the point the 
subject is no longer under the officer’s control.     

a. 

Exposed – Not In Custody  

If the subject is not in custody and appears to be in a normal state 
of health, but indicates that he has a history of cardiac-related 
health issues, the subject will be offered transportation by the 
officer to a hospital.  The officer may also contact EMS if the 
subject prefers not to ride with the officer.  A subject who has not 
been arrested may not be forced to receive medical treatment.

subject to a hospital unless in the officer’s opinion EMS is more 
appropriate for transport.   

Subjects who are in custody and are pregnant and/or medically  
or physically limited will be transported to a hospital unless in  
the officer’s opinion EMS is more appropriate for transport.     

Subjects who are arrested and have been exposed to more than  
three 5 second CEW cycles, will be taken to a hospital unless in  
the officer’s opinion EMS is more appropriate for transport.   

  

Following the deployment of a CEW, a Conducted Electronic Device  
Certified Officer may remove probes that have penetrated the skin,  
however, probes that strike the subject in the head, face, neck, spine,  
breast,  or groin will be removed by Emergency Medical Services or   
hospital emergency department personnel.  Any probe that an officer is  
uncertain about removing will be removed by Emergency Medical   
Services or hospital emergency department personnel.  The officer will  
use protective  equipment such as disposable gloves and other universal  
precautions to prevent exposure to Bloodborne pathogens.  Probes will be  
removed following the steps outlined in the CEW lesson plan. 

Probes that are removed by advanced medical personnel will be  
photographed prior to removal. However, treatment should not be delayed  
for the purpose of obtaining photographs. 

 

If the CEW discharge was unintentional and no one was struck and/or  
injured, the officer will document actions leading to the discharge in a  
general memorandum to their immediate supervisor.   

Immediate Supervisor and Field Commander Responsibilities 

In addition to the duties listed in Section IV of this General Order, Immediate  
Supervisors are responsible for the following: 
 
1. 
 

When possible, ensure probe impact points on the body are photographed  
before and after removal. 

Whenever a CEW is utilized (cartridge fired) by an officer, the officer’s  
immediate supervisor will ensure that the CEW is downloaded prior to  
shift end, as trained.  A download may be completed by any sworn   
departmental supervisor or CEW instructor.  A copy of the downloaded  
use log will be printed and attached to the Incident Report.

J:\TRAINING\INSERVICE\LessonPlans\2011 

The SAGE Control Ordnance SL6 Less Lethal Launcher should be considered in 
situations where closing distance with a subject could cause an escalation of force 
or increased risk of injury to any person within close proximity to the incident.   
For example, deployment of the SAGE Launcher may be used against a 
noncompliant  suspect armed with a knife who refuses to obey lawful commands 
to drop the knife.  This may allow for the suspect to be taken into custody without 
resorting to a higher level of force. 

Post Exposure Procedures
